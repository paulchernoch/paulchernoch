          <h1>Proverbs 4 to 19</h1>
          
          <p class="date">Published on 2024-06-26</p>
          
          <p>This article was originally published as a portion of "Appendix E: The Plan of Proverbs",
in <em>Peace, Like Solomon Never Knew</em>. It covers chapters four to nineteen of Proverbs.
The appendix was the proof that Proverbs chapters four to thirty-one conform to Solomon's <a href="./growth-pattern.html">Growth Pattern</a>.
That means that each chapter matches one of the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3, in the order given by that poem.
This article supplies textual evidence to support each match to one of those times.</p>

<p>As a celestial clock, each chapter also matches an era of history, as given.
Apart from chapters 1, 2, 3 and 31, all chapters define an era 120 years in length.
In addition, for many (but not all) chapters, predictive prophecies in the chapter are revealed that point to events
that occurred in that era of history - or will occur if that era is still in our future.</p>

<p><strong>So what?</strong> Most of the prophecies revealed by this clock are for events that have already happened.
Only prophecies of the future can help a person prepare for the future, right? Wrong! 
These prophecies show that God has structured history according to the same principles that he structures our lives. 
The same sequence of steps that He employs to advance civilizations also define the path for individuals from foolish to wise and child to mature adult.
The fulfilled prophecies show us the efficacy of those principles and provide encouragement to follow them.
By providing a philosophy of history, this growth pattern turns the history books into a training manual for life.
Finally, it helps us match individual wise sayings to the times of our life, so that we are not just pulling 
random sayings out of the Bible to guide our decisions and help us plan our futures. The rich and relevant detail of such guidance is priceless,
and for decades I never knew such a thing was in the Bible to be discovered!</p>

<h2>Proverbs 4. 960–840 BC. <em>A time to be born</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. The writer addresses his son four times, in
verses 1, 3, 10 and 20, which connects to the time of being born.
In doing so, he thinks back to when he was a child,
saying, <em>“When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother…”</em> (4:3) 
How important it is to remember our own childhood when we try to raise the next generation.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong>. No king of Israel was ever exalted as highly as
Solomon, matching these verses about the reward for
prizing wisdom:</p>

<h4>Prize her highly, and she will <strong>exalt</strong> you;</h4>

<h5>she will honor you if you embrace her.</h5>

<h4>She will place on your head a graceful garland;</h4>

<h5>she will <strong>bestow on you a beautiful crown</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 4:8-9</h6>

<h2>Proverbs 5. 840–720 BC. <em>A time to die</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme and History</strong>. The time of the divided kingdom
came to an end in this era. For Israel, it was a time to die.
This happened at the hands of the Assyrians. The warning
is found here:</p>

<h4>For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,</h4>

<h5>and her speech is smoother than oil,</h5>

<h4>but in the end she is bitter as <strong>wormwood</strong>,</h4>

<h5>sharp as a <strong>two-edged sword</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Her feet go down to <strong>death</strong>;</h4>

<h5>her steps follow the path to Sheol…</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 5:3-5</h6>

<p>The charge against the nation was idolatry, which is
metaphorically given as giving into the temptation of an
adulteress. The severity of the judgment is defined by two
images, wormwood and the two-edged (or in other
translations, double-edged) sword. In Amos 5:7, the
bitterness of wormwood is an analogy for injustice. In
Revelation 8:10–11, wormwood is the deadly star that falls
and poisons the waters following the blowing of the third
trumpet.</p>

<p>Previous chapters explored the meaning of the double-
edged sword throughout Scripture. It is associated with
severe judgment. Taken together with wormwood, this
promised the complete destruction of the northern
kingdom of Israel.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 6. 720–600 BC. <em>A time to plant</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. The father here exhorts his son not to be lazy.
He offers an example from nature to illustrate that
conscientiousness in planting will lead to an abundant
harvest:</p>

<h4>Go to the ant, O sluggard;</h4>

<h5>consider her ways, and be wise.</h5>

<h4>Without having any chief,</h4>

<h5>officer, or ruler,</h5>

<h4>she prepares her bread in summer</h4>

<h5>and gathers her food in harvest.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 6:6-8, ESV</h6>

<p><strong>History</strong>. King Hezekiah lived in this era, was industrious
and prospered his nation. However, he had the King of
Assyria to contend with, which required skill in diplomacy,
meticulous planning, courage and faith. Other kings of
Judah in similar situations made the disastrous decision to
fight against a superior opponent and suffered crushing
defeat. What did Hezekiah do?</p>

<h4>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria</h4>

<h4>came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. And</h4>

<h4>Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying,</h4>

<h5><em>*“I have done wrong; withdraw from me. *</em></h5>

<h5><strong>Whatever you impose on me I will bear.”</strong></h5>

<h4>And the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah</h4>

<h4>three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</h4>

<h6>- 2 Kings 18:13-14</h6>

<p>The king humbled himself, paid tribute, and prepared
carefully for the day when he could throw off the yoke of
Assyria. That day eventually arrived. This chapter of
Proverbs gives advice that Hezekiah seems to have taken to
heart:</p>

<h4>if you are snared in the words of your mouth,</h4>

<h5>caught in the words of your mouth,</h5>

<h4>then do this, my son, and save yourself,</h4>

<h5>for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:</h5>

<h5>go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</h5>

<h4>Give your eyes no sleep</h4>

<h5>and your eyelids no slumber;</h5>

<h4>save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,</h4>

<h5>like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 6:2-5</h6>

<p>The king knew his limits and did not mistake pride for
faith. He is a good role model for us all.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 7. 600–480 BC. <em>A time to uproot</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. No farming analogy is given here, just the
metaphorical meaning of a people being uprooted from
life. The agent is once again a prostitute, as in verse 26, which says 
<em>“for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. It was said of the forbidden woman of chapter five that 
<em>“Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol…”</em> (5:5) 
This prostitute follows a similar path: 
<em>“Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.”</em> (7:27) 
However, the judgment predicted by this chapter is less sever than that against northern
Israel. This judgment is against Judah, the Babylonian Exile.</p>

<p>The clue that the judgment would not be total and permanent eradication of the nation is found in these words: 
<em>“I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen…”</em> (7:16) 
Returning to Egypt symbolizes a return to slavery, not annihilation.</p>

<p>This connection is not novel. Linking the people’s
abandoning of their faith to engaging in prostitution and
searching for political security by allying with Egypt is a
common theme among the prophets.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 8. 480–360 BC. <em>A time to kill</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. This chapter is among the brightest chapters in
the book. All the positive aspects of wisdom and the
wonders of God’s acts in creating the universe are on full
display. Only in the concluding verses does the warning
appear:</p>

<h4>Blessed is the one who listens to me,</h4>

<h5>watching daily at my gates,</h5>

<h6>waiting beside my doors.</h6>

<h4>For whoever finds me finds life</h4>

<h5>and obtains favor from the Lord,</h5>

<h4>but he who fails to find me injures himself;</h4>

<h5>all who hate me love death.”</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 8:34-36</h6>

<p>In many other verses, God’s agency in executing
judgment against the wicked is described. Not here. The
fool kills himself.</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. In this era, that fool was Haman the Agagite,
who sought vengeance against Mordecai and all the Jews.
Consider the mistakes he made and the prudent decisions
Mordecai and Esther made.</p>

<ul>
<li>In verse 3, Wisdom appears before the city gates to make her appeal. Then in verse 34, she says, <em>“Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.”</em> When Mordecai sought justice and mercy, he appeared daily in sackcloth before the king’s gate.</li>
<li>Verse 15 says, <em>“By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just.”</em> Mordecai, Esther and the Jews of Susa fasted, to implore God (who is unnamed in Esther) to intervene and change the mind of the king, because they had faith that God, not Xerxes, was in ultimate control.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in what did Haman trust? He offered a large bribe of silver (in Esther 3:9) to the king to get the edict against the Jews issued. Haman was not listening to Wisdom’s advice: <em>“Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.”</em> (8:10)</li>
<li>While Haman was bold with his malevolence, Esther displayed great tact in how she proceeded, using two banquets to patiently make her case, embodying these words: <em>“I, wisdom, dwell with <strong>prudence</strong>, and I find knowledge and <strong>discretion</strong>.”</em> (8:12)</li>
<li>In the end, Haman was hung from the scaffolding he had constructed for Mordecai, fulfilling the final words: <em>“he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death.”</em> (8:36)</li>
</ul>

<p>No chapter in the Bible sings the praises of Wisdom
more than Proverbs 8. Mordecai and Esther heard her
voice, but they were not alone. Between 480 and 360 BC,
more than two dozen major Greek philosophers lived and
died. Among the notable sages alive in this era were
Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Hippocrates and Aristotle. This
was the era in which God began to pour out His wisdom
upon the wider world.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 9. 360–240 BC. <em>A time to heal</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. The quartet of times kill, heal, tear down and
build are about a child developing abilities of mind and
body. This passage speaks of how correction builds even
the wise up further in wisdom, but also health: 
<em>“For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.”</em> (9:11)</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. In chapter 8, wisdom was disclosed. Now she
builds her house. The previous generation saw the Greeks
advance rapidly in knowledge. Now they built their house –
their empire. Alexander the Great spread the wisdom (and
folly) of Hellenic civilization far and wide. Yet what became
of him?</p>

<h4>Wisdom has built her house;</h4>

<h5>she has hewn her seven pillars.</h5>

<h4>She has <strong>slaughtered her beasts</strong>;</h4>

<h5>she has <strong>mixed her wine</strong>;</h5>

<h6>she has also set her table.</h6>

<h6>- Proverbs 9:1-2, ESV</h6>

<p>This time saw the slaughter of one prophetic beast (the
Medo-Persian Empire) and the splintering of another
(Alexander’s Macedonian Empire). While drinking wine at a
banquet, the conqueror fell ill and soon died. Earlier in this
book evidence was supplied that this man of unlimited
arrogance was poisoned. Don’t mess with Lady Wisdom.</p>

<p>The seven pillars may be seven beastly empires. Israel
was the first of Revelation’s eight and is being reformed.
The next six beasts have been slaughtered, from Assyria to
Islam. The eighth is the kingdom of the anti-Christ. They
are the pillars of human civilization, which will be cast
aside for God’s eternal kingdom.</p>

<p>An alternate interpretation of the pillars is that they are
the seven books of Wisdom: Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of
Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. All these are
structured according to the 28 times from Ecclesiastes 3
and are in turn grouped into the sevenfold Harvest Pattern.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 10. 240–120 BC. <em>A time to tear down</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. Tearing down is about destruction, and this
chapter is full of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>A slack hand causes poverty (10:4)</li>
<li>The name of the wicked will rot (10:7)</li>
<li>A babbling fool will come to ruin (10:8,10)</li>
<li>The mouth of a fool brings ruin near (10:14)</li>
<li>A rich man's wealth is his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin (10:15)</li>
<li>Fools die for lack of sense (10:21)</li>
<li>When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more (10:25)</li>
<li>The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the blameless, but destruction to evildoers (10:29)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. In this era, Antiochus Epiphanes persecuted
the Jews, outlawed their religious practices, and desecrated
their temple. The Jew’s “strong city” of verse 15 could not
withstand his rage, and was destroyed. 2 Maccabees 5:11–14
says of his assault that he “took Jerusalem by storm”,
echoing the tempest of verse 25.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 11. 120 BC–1 AD. <em>A time to build</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme and Prophecy</strong>. One thing of consequence is
built in this era. The cornerstone of the church is laid, and
that cornerstone is Christ.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>With the humble is wisdom.</em> (11:2) Jesus was “meek and humble of heart”, born in a stable, not a palace.</li>
<li><em>Righteousness delivers from death.</em> (11:4) Herod tried to have Jesus killed, but failed.</li>
<li><em>By knowledge the righteous are delivered.</em> (11:9) Joseph and the Magi received knowledge from the angels and were delivered from Herod’s schemes.</li>
<li><em>A gracious woman gets honor.</em> (11:16) Remember Mary’s Magnificat? “All generations shall call me blessed!” Then remember the famous prayer: “Hail Mary, full of <strong>grace</strong>, Lord is with thee…” No woman in history has received as much honor as she.</li>
<li><em>The offspring of the righteous will be delivered.</em> (11:21) Jesus is the offspring who was delivered, and Mary his righteous mother.</li>
<li><em>Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered.</em> (11:25) Jesus told the woman at the well that he was the living water.</li>
<li><em>The people curse him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it.</em> (11:26) Jesus is the Bread of Life and Lord of the Harvest, who fed the crowds, body and soul.</li>
<li><em>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise.</em> (11:30) Other translations say “wins souls”. Jesus is the tree of life who wins souls marked for death and gives them eternal life.</li>
<li>
How many dozens of times I have read this chapter and
never saw these connections to the Advent story! Truly we
are blind to the glory of God’s Word!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proverbs 12. 1–120 AD. <em>A time to weep</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. The verse that comes closest to reflecting “a time to weep” is: 
<em>Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but <strong>a good word</strong> makes him glad.</em> (12:25)</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. And what a good word we have! Up to this
point, women were mothers, adulteresses, prostitutes,
wise, foolish, and then gracious. Now we see a very
different woman, more poetically described in the NIV:</p>

<h4>A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown,</h4>

<h5>but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.</h5>

<h6>- 12:4, NIV</h6>

<p>Here the noble wife is introduced, like the start of a
courtship that will not be consummated until the last
chapter, which is devoted to extolling her many virtues.
Who is this good woman? She is the church. This era brings
us to Pentecost, the day the church was baptized with
tongues of fire.</p>

<p><em>“The mouth of the upright delivers them.”</em> (12:6) 
This recalls Peter speaking boldly before the Sanhedrin and Paul
delivered from an assassination plot and many other
dangers. Their speech, their mouths, declared God’s
counsel and they were delivered.</p>

<p><em>“The root of the righteous bears fruit.”</em> (12:12) Jesus is the
“root of Jesse” (Isaiah 11:10) from which flows the sap that
enables us to bear fruit.</p>

<p><em>“The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand.”</em> (12:7) 
Jerusalem was destroyed and its people scattered, but the house that is the church
(an analogy much used in Hebrews) stood fast.</p>

<p><em>“Truthful lips endure forever.”</em> (12:19) Jesus said that
heaven and earth will pass away, but his words will never
pass away.</p>

<p><em>“Deceit is in the heart of those who <strong>devise evil</strong>, but those who <strong>plan peace have joy</strong>.”</em> (12:20) 
The previous quotes
mostly gave the good news. This time both halves of the
syllogism apply to the same man: Saul of Tarsus. He
devised evil against the church and dragged them off to
prison. Then Jesus shattered his world and he became Paul
the Apostle. No other Bible writer spoke more of peace
than Paul. He planned peace and received joy. His letter to
the Philippians contained the words that set me free from a
life of depression and poured the power of the Holy Spirit
and joy into me.</p>

<p>Finally, we arrive at the blessed hope. 
<em>“In the path of righteousness is life, and in its pathway there is no death.”</em> (12:28) 
This was the time when Jesus defeated death, rose
from the dead, and promised his faithful the same. On that
day, we shall weep, but for joy.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 13. 120–240 AD. <em>A time to laugh</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. This pair of times is about more than crying and
laughing, it is about learning verbal self control. This
chapter offers advice on how to do just that:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.</em> (13:1) When parents or others in authority give advice, listen and don’t talk back.</li>
<li><em>From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good, but the desire of the treacherous is for violence.</em> (13:2) Foolish talk starts fights.</li>
<li><em>Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.</em> (13:3)</li>
<li><em>The righteous hates falsehood, but the wicked brings shame and disgrace.</em> (13:5) Telling the truth requires self control, because if you have done wrong, you fear the consequences.</li>
<li><em>The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</em> (13:9) There is much laughter in rejoicing. The conclusion of a life of words well spoken is joy.</li>
<li><em>Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself, but he who reveres the commandment will be rewarded.</em> (13:13) The most excellent transformation is when God’s words become your words, his truths your truths, and his goals your goals.</li>
<li><em>Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.</em> (13:20) Verbal self control is fostered by hanging out with the right crowd.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why aren’t these injunctions about how to control your
tongue in the chapter for “a time to speak”? The mature
person must pass through three stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning self control and acquiring the simpler aspects of wisdom, as expressed in this chapter</li>
<li>Listening to God and learning from experience the deeper truths of the faith</li>
<li>Speaking what you have learned to your children and those in the world ready to hear</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. The era or Roman persecution was a time
when God taught the church self control. It worked out
basic doctrine, refuted heresies, and struggled to preserve
its blessed hope:</p>

<h4>Hope deferred makes the heart sick,</h4>

<h5>but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 13:12</h6>

<p>The persecutions did not prove God had abandoned the
church, but that he loved it:</p>

<h4>Whoever spares the rod hates their children,</h4>

<h5>but the one who loves their children</h5>

<h6>is careful to discipline them.</h6>

<h6>- Proverbs 13:24</h6>

<p>Some chapters of Proverbs have a few connections to the
theme matching Solomon’s times, some many. Is there a
reason that this one had so many matches? Yes. It is
because the severe pain of these trials necessitated that
God speak many clear words to encourage and strengthen
the church of that day. This era began the age of the church
of Smyrna. Recall that in Revelation, of the seven churches
only this church was given strong clues about how long
they must endure: ten episodes of persecution. They
needed extra grace if they were to persevere and the Father
provided it. When God gives details about time, such as the
seventy years of the Babylonian Exile, you can be sure the
suffering will be great. If the ideas of this book are correct,
then God has chosen to clarify for our generation His
prophetic structures for all of history. He is not doing that
because I am holier or wiser than the saints who came
before. He must be doing it because we face great danger
and need extra help if we are to overcome.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 14. 240–360 AD. <em>A time to mourn</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme and Prophecy</strong>. We mourn when we lose something precious. 
This chapter is filled with causes for mourning:</p>

<ul>
<li>A house torn down (14:1) or destroyed (14:11)</li>
<li>The rod of punishment (14:3)</li>
<li>Loss of God’s acceptance (14:9)</li>
<li>Loss of reputation (14:17)</li>
<li>Loss of authority (14:19)</li>
<li>Loss of friends (14:20)</li>
<li>Loss of power (14:28)</li>
<li>Declining health (14:30)</li>
<li>Alienating the king (14:35)</li>
</ul>

<p>Christians suffered all these losses and more at the hands
of the emperors of this era. However, so did the rest of the
empire’s citizens due to the turmoil of the times. The
church had an advantage: the mercy of God. 
<em>“Fools mock at the guilt offering, but the upright enjoy acceptance.”</em> (14:9)
Christians confess their sins to their Maker and do not
mock the divinely appointed guilt offering, which is Jesus
Christ. In him we find God’s acceptance.</p>

<p>To be a Christian is to be separated from the world. 
<em>“The heart knows its own bitterness, and no stranger shares its joy.”</em> (14:10) 
Yet Jesus is no stranger to the broken-hearted. He walks with us
through bitter and sweet. Also, through his apostle, he commands us to 
<em>“Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.”</em> (Romans 12:15)</p>

<p>The Lord understands how jarring life’s transitions may be, for: 
<em>“Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief.”</em> (14:13) 
This era saw rapid swings between harsh and lenient emperors, to which the faithful had to
adapt. The crisis of the third century saw twenty-six claimants to the title of emperor in a period of fifty years.
<em>“The wisest of women builds her house, but folly with her own hands tears it down.”</em> (14:1) 
The wise woman is again the church, while Rome’s foolish woman is Athena or any other
of the worthless idols they bowed down before. 
Rome’s folly split in into smaller kingdoms and launched endless civil wars. 
<em>“The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.”</em> (14:11) 
In the midst of this chaos, the ranks of the Christians swelled, while adherence
to the old religion withered. What was the end result? 
<em>“The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.”</em> (14:18) 
Constantine bestowed legitimacy upon Christianity and had his troops march under the banner of
the cross. Thus became true this exultant proverb:</p>

<h4>The evil bow down before the good,</h4>

<h5>the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 14:19</h6>

<p>Christians accomplished this through obedience to the Golden Rule. 
<em>“Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner, but blessed is he who is generous to the poor.”</em> (14:21) 
Caring for the poor, the sick, the orphan and the foundling won them
respect in the eyes of society. In the end, the adoption of
Christianity extended the life of Roman civilization, making
it the longest lasting empire in history. How?</p>

<h4>Righteousness exalts a nation,</h4>

<h5>but sin is a reproach to any people.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 14:34</h6>

<h2>Proverbs 15. 360–480 AD. <em>A time to dance</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. This chapter has a few things to say about
cheerfulness and joy. They can come from what you say,
what you hear, or what you see. They also affect the health
of both spirit and body.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A glad heart makes a cheerful face, but by sorrow of heart the spirit is crushed.</em> (15:13)</li>
<li><em>All the days of the afflicted are evil, but the cheerful of heart has a continual feast.</em> (15:15)</li>
<li><em>To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a word in season, how good it is!</em> (15:23)</li>
<li><em>The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and good news refreshes the bones.</em> (15:30)</li>
</ul>

<p>The preceding proverbs are obvious and useless if taken
in their passive sense of things that happen to you. The
power is yours to put on your dancing shoes. The sun
shines on most days. Do you lie in bed in despair, or wake
to see the glorious sunrise? The tidings on TV, most news
sites, and many other media are grim. Do you seek out
good news to refresh your bones? Do you wallow in your
afflictions, or make yourself and your words a blessing to
others?</p>

<p>Despite chronic depression, for eighteen months I
meditated on Habakkuk 3:17-19 every day. I learned to “take
joy in the God of my salvation” even when I did not feel like
it. In the end I found my feast. Have you found yours?</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. In this era, by the Edict of Thessalonica, the
Roman Empire became a Christian empire. You can be certain the church rejoiced! 
<em>“In the house of the righteous there is much treasure, but trouble befalls the income of the wicked.”</em> (15:6) 
As Jesus foretold, the strong man was now bound and the kingdom of God began to plunder its treasure.</p>

<p>Sadly, history did not stop. Death and destruction (Sheol and Abaddon) also appear in this chapter, 
and in this chapter of history.</p>

<h4>Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord;</h4>

<h5>how much more the hearts of the children of man!</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 15:11</h6>

<h4>The path of life leads upward for the prudent,</h4>

<h5>that he may turn away from Sheol beneath.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 15:24</h6>

<p>Two verses naming Sheol means two cataclysms struck
Rome. In 410, Alaric sacked Rome. For the first time in 800
years, the Eternal City was occupied by outsiders and
looted. Then in 476, Odoacer captured Rome and was
named king, ending the Roman system. It was the end of
the Western Roman Empire. The latter did not destroy the
city, he claimed and kept it. Thus the first verse mentions
death and destruction; the second merely death. No
empires, not even Christian ones, are exempt from God’s
judgment.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 16. 480–600 AD. <em>A time to scatter stones</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. Gathering and scattering stones is about
deciding when to cooperate and when to part ways.
Choosing workers, partners, investors, suppliers, shippers,
and every other agent needed for an enterprise requires
wisdom. It is a vital component of planning. This chapter
talks about planning in at least twenty of its thirty-three
verses. There are our plans (16:1-3,9), God’s plans
(16:1-3,4,5,7,9), the plans of the righteous or the plans of the
wicked (16:25,27-30). Some verses speak of the role of the
king in the success of your plans (16:10,12-16) or how a wise
heart speaks words that are more persuasive (16:21,23).</p>

<p>Among those verses is one that specifically counsels one to not associate with the proud: 
<em>“It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor than to divide the spoil with the proud.”</em> (16:19) 
Other verses, by implication, caution one to avoid doing business with the <strong>arrogant</strong> (16:5), 
the <strong>dishonest</strong> (16:28), the <strong>violent</strong> (16:29), and the <strong>deceitful</strong> (16:30) who
wink their eyes and purse their lips.</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. The previous era saw the collapse of the
Western Roman Empire. In this time, Byzantium in the east
received a blow: the Plague of Justinian, plus many wars.
However, Pope Gregory the Great in the west seems to be
the one who embodies the following proverb. 
<em>“A king's wrath is a messenger of death, and a wise man will appease it.”</em> (16:14) 
Another conqueror threatened to slaughter the
people of Rome, but this Pope used diplomacy to avert
bloodshed. He also used the produce from Papal lands to
feed the poor. Justinian’s wars exacerbated the effects of
famine and plague, but Gregory’s humility saved lives,
because: <em>“Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.”</em> (16:32)</p>

<h2>Proverbs 17. 600–720 AD. <em>A time to gather stones</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. Broadly, gathering stones is about cooperation,
but it can also mean actually gathering stones to build. This
chapter shows both, in wise and foolish situations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. (17:1)</li>
<li>Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their fathers. (17:6)</li>
<li>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. (17:17)</li>
<li>One who lacks sense gives a pledge and puts up security in the presence of his neighbor. (17:18)</li>
<li>Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin; whoever builds <strong>a high gate</strong> invites destruction. (17:19, NIV)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first listed proverb tells us that cooperation breeds a
peace that excels what mere wealth can provide. The
second extols the outcome of a family in harmony across
the generations. The third describes as precious having
someone that can be relied upon at a moment’s notice in
an crisis, whether friend of brother.</p>

<p>Then in the fourth we turn to the flip side: cooperating
with people whose trustworthiness is not tested. I once
vouched for an acquaintance interviewing at my company.
He turned out to be unqualified and lied about his
credentials. That was the last time I did that!</p>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. The fifth proverb above veers into prophetic
territory. The “high gate” is probably meant
metaphorically, but Byzantium took it at face value. After
losing the military outpost of Nisibis (near the Persian
frontier), Constantinople was at a disadvantage. Lacking a
well-watered place to stage their troops, they suffered
heavy losses. In response, they built the nearby village of
Dara up into a city. Its towers were a hundred feet tall. That
sounds like a pretty high gate to me. Dara was in the
neutral zone between the two empires, so this violated a
treaty and enraged the Persians. Byzantium held made
good use of the city in several battles, but ultimately lost it
in 605 AD after a seven month siege. They regained it years
later, only to lose it to the Arabs in 639 AD.</p>

<p>The high gates of that city truly invited destruction. It
may seem like an obscure piece of history, but that
particular conflict between the Sassanid Empire (Persia)
and Byzantium lasted so long that it depleted both empires
and created an opening for the Islamic conquest of the
Middle East.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 18. 720–840 AD. <em>A time to embrace</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. Positive and negative examples of embracing are
offered here. First we see how selfishness wrecks your
judgment.</p>

<h4>Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire;</h4>

<h5>he breaks out against all sound judgment.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 18:1</h6>

<p>Next, if we abet the wicked (like prosecutors who refuse
to press charges or judges who release murderers without
bail), we are in essence embracing them:</p>

<h4>It is not good to be partial to the wicked</h4>

<h5>or to deprive the righteous of justice.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 18:5</h6>

<p>Instead, for safety we should embrace the Lord:</p>

<h4>The name of the Lord is a strong tower;</h4>

<h5>the righteous man runs into it and is safe.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 18:10</h6>

<p>To preserve the benefits of intimate friendship with
friends and family, there are things to be avoided:</p>

<h4>A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,</h4>

<h5>and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 18:19</h6>

<p>The pinnacle of embracing is a strong marriage. If you
find a wife (or husband), do not despise the Lord’s favor by
breaking your vows.</p>

<h4>He who finds a wife finds a good thing</h4>

<h5>and obtains favor from the Lord.</h5>

<h6>-Proverbs 18:22</h6>

<p>Marriage is hard. Families fight. Selfishness pushes us
away from God. Some people give up on those three and
put all their eggs in one basket: a large group of friends.
That can be a mistake:</p>

<h4>A man of many companions may come to ruin,</h4>

<h5>but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 18:24</h6>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. Christian Europe was on the brink of
collapse, until Charles Martel brought victory at Tours in
732 AD, to be followed by Charlemagne later in the era. It
was a time when Christians needed “the name of the Lord”
to be “a strong tower” as in verse 10. As for finding a wife
and receiving favor, Byzantine Empresses Irene and
Theodora restored the veneration of icons and helped
settle the boundaries of acceptable worship in the church,
how Christians may embrace their Lord.</p>

<h2>Proverbs 19. 840–960 AD. <em>A time to refrain</em></h2>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. To refrain from embracing is to intentionally
avoid dangerous alliances when pursued deliberately, or it
is to be cruelly isolated from society by discrimination or
prejudice, especially against the poor:</p>

<h4>Wealth brings many new friends,</h4>

<h5>but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:4</h6>

<h4>All a poor man's brothers hate him;</h4>

<h5>how much more do his friends go far from him!</h5>

<h4>He pursues them with words,</h4>

<h5>but does not have them.</h5>

<h6>- 19:7</h6>

<p>Many people embrace the givers of bribes and other
favors, but shouldn’t:</p>

<h4>Many seek the favor of a generous man,</h4>

<h5>and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</h5>

<h6>- 19:6</h6>

<p>Currying the favor of authority is a fearful enterprise:</p>

<h4>A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion,</h4>

<h5>but his favor is like dew on the grass.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:12</h6>

<p>While people are avoiding their poor relations, chasing
after big spenders, and wooing princes, God tells us who
we should be embracing instead:</p>

<h4>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord,</h4>

<h5>and he will repay him for his deed.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:17</h6>

<p>Repeatedly bailing out unstable friends should make you
reconsider your alliances:</p>

<h4>A man of great wrath will pay the penalty,</h4>

<h5>for if you deliver him,</h5>

<h6>you will only have to do it again.</h6>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:19</h6>

<p>Likewise, the character of your friends should be
important to you:</p>

<h4>What is desired in a man is steadfast love,</h4>

<h5>and a poor man is better than a liar.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:22, ESV</h6>

<p>Finally, whatever problems we have at home, we should
pursue reconciliation leading to an embrace, not this:</p>

<h4>He who does violence to his father</h4>

<h5>and chases away his mother</h5>

<h6>is a son who brings shame and reproach.</h6>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:26, ESV</h6>

<p><strong>Prophecy</strong>. East and West drifted farther apart in this era,
as detailed in previous chapters; they no longer embraced
the same vision of Christianity. However, one cautionary
tale from this era seems most apropos:</p>

<h4>It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,</h4>

<h5>much less for a slave to rule over princes.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 19:10, ESV</h6>

<p>Basil I, Emperor of Byzantium from 867–886 AD, was
the child of peasants carried off to Bulgaria as slaves. He
rose through the military ranks until he gained the favor of
Emperor Michael III, but later murdered the emperor and
took his place. He was considered an effective emperor.
Maybe that was the problem. When your ideal rulers are
murderous usurpers, your nation has embraced trouble.
Basil’s belt got snagged in antlers during a hunt. He was
dragged a mile and died of his wounds, but not before
executing the man who cut him free from the antlers in a fit
of paranoia.</p>
