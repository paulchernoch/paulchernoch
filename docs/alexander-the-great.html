</div>

<hr/>

<p>Above is illustrated the "Nine Worthies", nine historical "princes" who possessed traits thought to embody the
ideals of chivalry. <em>One of those nine is Alexander the Great. I defy you to guess which one! I couldn't...</em> 
(The answer is at the end of this article.) The Nine Worthies include (though not in the same order as in the carving):</p>

<ul>
<li>three pagans (Hector, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar), </li>
<li>three Jews (Joshua, David and Judas Maccabeus) and </li>
<li>three Christians (King Arthur, Charlemagne and Godfrey of Bouillon)</li>
</ul>

<p>This article first appeared in the chapter "CSI Babylon: Job 20" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.
For centuries, doctors and historians have tried to solve the mystery of how Alexander the Great died.
Poison? Infected battle wound? Illness? The symptoms of his ailment were dutifully recorded by his attendants
and preserved for posterity. New diagnoses pop up every few years in a medical journal.
So like investigators in one of those Crime Scene Investigation TV shows, we shall try to solve the mystery using
information that those doctors have not considered: the Bible.</p>

<h2>CSI Babylon: Job 20</h2>

<p>How did Alexander the Great die? Every few years,
another doctor writes a journal article with a shiny
new diagnosis. They base their theories on
surviving accounts by ancient historians. Are they missing a
key piece of evidence? We continue our chapter-by-chapter
dissection of Job with the twentieth chapter, whose speaker
is the most obnoxious of the three friends, Zophar.</p>

<p><strong>Speech 13</strong>. 338-219 BC. Zophar (Job 20). </p>

<p>Everyone who lived in the Middle East during the 20th generation lived in the
shadow of one man: Alexander the Great. When he died, they say his body showed no sign of decay for six
days, proving his divinity. Doctors still argue about what killed him. Was it:</p>

<ul>
<li>malaria? <a href="#bib38">[38]</a></li>
<li>poison? <a href="#bib34">[34]</a></li>
<li>polio? <a href="#bib38">[38]</a></li>
<li>typhoid fever? <a href="#bib38">[38]</a></li>
<li>Guillain-Barré Syndrome? <a href="#bib33">[33]</a></li>
<li>alcohol poisoning?</li>
<li>gallstones followed by acute pancreatic necrosis? <a href="#bib37">[37]</a></li>
<li>wine fermented from Veratrum album (white hellebore)? <a href="#bib34">[34]</a></li>
<li>West Nile encephalitis? <a href="#bib36">[36]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(Refer to sources [32-42].)</p>

<p>Over two thousand years later, we have no body to
examine and no witnesses to interview. Will we ever
know for certain how he died? At least historians like
Flavius Arrianus, Ptolemy, Plutarch, and Quintus
Curtius preserved the symptoms and progression of
the disease.</p>

<p>During a banquet to honor the death of his best
friend, Alexander consumed much wine. He was
struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Plutarch
related that another pain felt as though he were stuck
in the back with a spear. Doctors induced vomiting to
empty his stomach, fearing poison or tainted food.
Over the coming days, he spiked a high fever. They
used cold baths to try to break the fever. Alexander
suffered exhaustion, intense thirst, chills, and
difficulty breathing. Then followed jaundice,
delusions, convulsions and a creeping paralysis.
Though not one of the early symptoms, he eventually
lost his appetite and suffered diarrhea. At the end, he
he became mute and could move only his hands and
eyes. Between eleven and fourteen days after he took
ill, he died, weeks before his thirty-third birthday.</p>

<p>What does Zophar’s speech have to do with a
Macedonian conqueror? In my book on Job, I
associated the three friends with an evil Trinity.
Eliphaz, who listened to a lying spirit in Job 4, was the
Evil Spirit. Bildad, who ridiculed the idea of trusting in
a “Son of Man”, was the Anti-Christ. That leaves
Zophar as the Father of Lies. This chapter has the best
evidence for such an association of Zophar with Satan.
In verse 14, he mentions the “venom of serpents”. Then he says, 
*“He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.” *(Job 20:16, NIV)</p>

<p>As Revelation 13 reveals, Satan controls the beasts of
the world, its evil empires. That means that Satan
controlled the empire of Alexander, one of the beasts
and one of the heads of Daniel’s visions. The devil is
full of hatred, even for his servants. Job 20 is Satan’s
epitaphios logos, his funeral oration, for the fallen
“Lord of Asia”, the “Great King” and “Son of Zeus”.
Here then are the profound connections between Job
20 (from the NIV) and the death of Alexander:</p>

<p><strong>Verse 5</strong>. <em>“... the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.”</em> 
Alexander fell ill during the merriment of a banquet.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 6</strong>. <em>“Though the pride of the godless person reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds...”</em> 
Though a man, he pursued and accepted divine honors and titles, just as Satan sought the throne of heaven.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 7</strong>. <em>“he will perish forever, like his own <strong>dung</strong>; those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’”</em> 
The word dung brings to mind the diarrhea that beset him.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 8</strong>. <em>“Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.”</em> 
Delirium and hallucinations seized him.</p>

<p><strong>Verses 9-10</strong>. <em>“The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more. His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.”</em> 
After Alexander died, his generals,
called the Diadochi, fought each other to seize his title
and kingdom. One was Cassander, who ordered the
execution of Alexander’s wife Roxane and his sons
Heracles and Alexander IV and usurped the throne of
Macedon. Wikipedia says this of Cassander. “It was
later even said that he could not pass a statue of
Alexander without feeling faint.” Truly the one who
took his place did not want look on him any more.
Among those who contend that Alexander was
poisoned, Cassander is their prime suspect.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 11</strong>. <em>“The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.”</em> 
Alexander died young.</p>

<p><strong>Verses 12-14</strong>. <em>“Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue, though he cannot bear to let it go and lets it linger in his mouth, yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.”</em> 
The first symptoms were excruciating
stomach pain. Yet despite the travails of the first day of
his illness, Alexander attended another banquet the
next day. He could not bear to let his pleasures go.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 15</strong>. <em>“He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.”</em> 
His doctors induced vomiting.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 16</strong>. <em>“He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.”</em> 
There is no mention of
real snakes in the historical record. This may refer to
medicines that his doctors gave him that worsened his
condition, or metaphorically to the supernatural agent
contributing to his death: Satan.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 17</strong>. “<em>He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.”</em> 
His corpse was encased in a sarcophagus filled with honey! (Honey deters the
decomposition of dead bodies.)</p>

<p><strong>Verse 18</strong>. <em>“What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.”</em>
Alexander eventually lost his appetite. Metaphorically,
it means he never enjoyed ruling over the empire he
conquered.</p>

<p><strong>Verse 20</strong>. <em>“Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.”</em>
Alexander suffered an unquenchable thirst.</p>

<p><strong>Verses 22-23</strong>. <em>“In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him. When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows on him.”</em> 
This describes the start of his anguish, when he
filled his belly with food and wine. The full force of
misery struck his belly first. Reports indicated that if
anyone touched his midsection gently it caused sharp
pain. This also identifies the second, more substantial
spiritual agent of Alexander’s destruction: God.</p>

<p><strong>Verses 24-26</strong>. <em>“Though he flees from an <strong>iron</strong> weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him. He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his <strong>liver</strong>. Terrors will come over him; total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. <strong>A fire unfanned will consume him</strong> and devour what is left in his tent.”</em> 
Though doctors say his
symptoms do not indicate cirrhosis as the cause of
death, Alexander was a heavy drinker, and drank to
excess the first two days of his illness, which may have
injured his liver and weakened his body’s ability to
fight off disease. Reports of his symptoms include
jaundice, indicating liver failure.</p>

<p>There is no mistaking the “fire unfanned”; persistent
high fever plagued him until he met his end. Also,
recall how Plutarch described the initial pain as feeling
like being stuck in the back with a spear, an almost
identical analogy to being pierced by an arrowhead.</p>

<p>A skeptic might argue that these symptoms could
apply to someone other than Alexander the Great.
Iron and bronze connect this passage to
Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the statue in Daniel 2.
Bronze refers to Alexander’s own empire. This
suggests treachery: the king of the bronze empire laid
low by bronze. Iron represents the next empire:
Rome. The kingdoms that sprang from his empire, the
Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, would eventually be
conquered by Rome, the iron weapon from which his
successors could not flee.</p>

<p><strong>Verses 27-28</strong>. <em>“The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him. <strong>A flood</strong> will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.”</em> 
The flood could be a poetic description of the ailing man’s
diarrhea, but there is no mistaking the wrath of both
heaven and earth. Both God and Satan had their hand
in Alexander’s destruction, including his house: the
murder of his wife and children.</p>

<p>After the idea of cross-referencing the chapters of
Job with history occurred to me, I quickly found
several close matches, before running into a brick
wall. A number of chapters had no obvious link,
prompting a mixture of discouragement and frenzied
research. Chapter 20 was among the most difficult. I
pondered these words:</p>

<h4>Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found,</h4>

<h5>banished like a vision of the night.</h5>

<h4>The eye that saw him will not see him again;</h4>

<h5>his place will look on him no more.</h5>

<h6>- Job 20:8-9, NIV</h6>

<p>This era was the beginning of the time between the
testaments, when God sent no prophets to Israel. God
was no more to be found. That connection was
tenuous, but taken together with the idea that this
chapter describes the death of Alexander, we have a
complete picture. Israel refused to listen to the
prophets, so God would stop sending them and
instead send conquerors to get his message across.</p>

<p>The last thing to say about Alexander is that while
human doctors don’t know what caused his death,
God knows. The proof is simple. If the Almighty can:</p>

<ul>
<li>describe the setting of Alexander’s death (a feast),</li>
<li>reveal most of his disease symptoms,</li>
<li>highlight a peculiar feature of his burial (being coated in honey)</li>
<li>account for the fate of his family </li>
<li>over a millennium before the man was born,</li>
<li><em>then the Lord knows everything</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With three references to the poison of snakes, which
symbolizes treachery, the likeliest interpretation is
that <strong>Alexander was poisoned</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that is 20/20 hindsight!</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>In an upcoming book, I will point out how one of Habakkuk’s prophecies also suggests poisoned wine. (That analysis ended up in <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>.)</li>
<li>During the Reformation, Johann Brenz (Brentius) in his commentary on Job 20:20, gave an illustration of the avaricious man, writing:</li>
</ol>

<h4>“You have an example of this in Alexander the Great, who,</h4>

<h4>not content with the sovereignty of one world, groaned on learning</h4>

<h4>that there were more worlds.”</h4>

<p>He made no claim that Job 20 was prophetic, but his observation is confirmatory.</p>

<h2>Answer to the Statuary Riddle:</h2>

<p>The 14th-century carving "Nine Good Heroes" (known as "Neun Gute Helden" in the original German) at City Hall in Cologne, Germany, is the earliest known representation of the Nine Worthies. From left to right are the three Christians: Charlemagne bearing an eagle upon his shield, King Arthur displaying three crowns, and Godfrey of Bouillon with a dog lying before him; then the three pagans: Julius Caesar, Hector, and <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> bearing a griffon upon his shield; and finally the three Jews: David holding a sceptre, Joshua, and Judah Maccabee. Thus <strong>Alexander the Great</strong> is sixth from the left.</p>
