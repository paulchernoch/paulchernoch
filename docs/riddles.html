        <h1>Riddles</h1>
        
        
        
        <p>Riddles are a delight and a torment. They are a delight to the teller and the rare soul
who can guess them. They are an aggravation to the dull-minded when their arrogant pretense
of wisdom is punctured. But oh, are riddles a torment to the person whose life depends on solving them. 
Such a person was the unnamed first wife of Samson the Judge, who died over a honey of a riddle.</p>

<p>I am no expert at solving riddles, but I love composing them. My first nonfiction book, <em>The Endless Hunt</em>, 
was filled with riddles of my own design. I ended every chapter with a riddle and answered it in the next.
As I study the Bible, I am keen to discover and solve the riddles I find along the way. The articles in
this section are about Biblical riddles that I have solved while researching and writing my books.</p>

<p>This article is about two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It will introduce a peculiar kind of riddle, which I call an <strong>Emotional Riddle</strong>.</li>
<li>It will explore a riddle that I haven't solved: Samson's riddle.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Emotional Riddles</h2>

<p>Emotional riddles are riddles that God has encrypted with an extra layer of security: triggering statements.
These riddles are phrased in a way that angers, confuses, causes despair and generally shuts people down from
looking further for answers. The riddle may tell you that you are worthless, aren't important enough to be told
the answer, that a matter is settled and unchangeable in a way that alienates or diminishes you.
The riddle may portray the speaker (a character in the Bible who delivers a message) in a light that makes them seem untrustworthy, proud, or foolish, so that you dismiss what they say without studying their words closer.</p>

<p>Why would God do this? Why would He cloak His messengers in garb that conceals what they have to say?</p>

<h4>It is the glory of God to conceal things,</h4>

<h5>but the glory of kings is to search things out.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 25:2</h6>

<p>God loves riddles. He even likes proposing hard riddles. If every one of His riddles was easy, then they would all 
have been solved by now. That would leave us late-born riddle lovers nothing to do.</p>

<p>God also prizes diligence. By including riddles whose difficulty ranges from the simple to the impossible, 
He rewards the patient student of the Bible with treasures that others will never know.</p>

<p>Looking at a few examples of emotional riddles should make things clearer.</p>

<p><strong>Elihu</strong>. In Job 32, we meet Elihu, a younger man. His words and attitude rub most people the wrong way. 
He spends a whole chapter telling Job that he has something to say - without saying anything! 
Elihu comes across like a windbag who loves the sound of his own voice. At a conference of pastors, 
one attendee asked for a show of hands. Who trusts what Elihu had to say and who thought him no better than the three friends?
The room was evenly split. That is an effective riddle. In my book <em>Job Rises</em>, I did a thorough analysis of Elihu's 
statements about Job and concluded that he was right. What tipped me toward believing him? It was these words:</p>

<h4>For I am full of words;</h4>

<h5>the spirit within me constrains me.</h5>

<h4>Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;</h4>

<h5>like new wineskins ready to burst.</h5>

<h4>I must speak, that I may find relief;</h4>

<h5>I must open my lips and answer.</h5>

<h6>- Job 32:18-20</h6>

<p>The bursting of a wineskin is found in a parable of Jesus. The wine is the new teachings of the Holy Spirit,
which require that a person be born again, otherwise they cannot comprehend it. It will literally blow their mind.
When I experienced the Baptism of the Holy Spirit decades ago, it was because I visited a dying Christian woman
named Janet. After I left her bedside, I was consumed with deep sadness and mourning, wept bitterly, but then a half hour later
was filled with joy. After church that morning, I rushed home, read Philippians, and then wrote a ten page article
about the joy of the Holy Spirit. My feeling of having this pent up energy and need to speak about God
perfectly matched what Elihu described in Job. How can that be?</p>

<p>At Janet's funeral months later, someone said something with which we all agreed, 
"When you were with Janet, it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."
Because I stood in the presence of a holy woman undergoing great suffering, 
and I was there to comfort her in her trials, the Holy Spirit passed from her to me.</p>

<p>In the Book of Job, Elihu was standing in the presence of Job, a suffering, righteous man.
He refused to speak harsh words and unjustly accuse Job without evidence of doing wicked things to deserve his suffering.
Because his heart was young and pliable, not like a tough old wineskin set in its ways like the three friends, 
Elihu was receptive. Thus the Holy Spirit entered him and he prophesied true words from God.
Had I never had the experience of meeting Janet and being transformed, I never would have understood Elihu.
The man did not say "nothing" in that first chapter; he said everything. Even he did not know where his words were coming from,
but he described his religious experience accurately so that later people with like experiences would be able to understand him.</p>

<p>Is Elihu the only person that we misunderstand? No!</p>

<p><strong>Hannah</strong>. Eli the judge, when he saw Hannah moving her lips but saying nothing, thought she was drunk and berated her.
She defended herself by saying that she was full of grief and pouring her heart out to God because of her barrenness. 
Hear that? A <em>judge</em> appointed by God <em>misjudged</em> a woman!</p>

<p>After God answered her desperate prayer, Hannah gave birth to a son, Samuel. In gratitude, Hannah uttered a wonderful prayer.
Have you read her prayer? Have you considered it so important that you devoted days to studying it, praying over it, 
and trying to comprehend its mysteries? Have you marveled at its prophetic richness? I never would have done any of these things, 
had God not showed me that her prayer spoke of certain mysteries of wisdom a century before Solomon lived and wrote more about them. 
She saw them first! I now consider her one of the wisest women who ever lived. I once thought of her as an ordinary, unschooled mom
with reproductive issues, a victim. In an emotional riddle, the concealing power of prejudice is immense. 
Hannah was a woman of no account to whom God gave a great gift. Do not look to the glaze on the earthen jar, look to its contents!</p>

<p>To get a peak at the contents of Hannah's prayer, read my article about it: </p>

<p><a href="./hannah-s-song.md">Hannah's Song</a></p>

<h2>Samson's Riddle</h2>

<p>In the Book of Judges, at the start of his seven-day wedding feast, Samson poses a riddle to the wedding guests.
If they can solve it in seven days, he will give them lots of clothes. Otherwise, they owe him.
Since they didn't have mechanical looms to make the fabric cheap and sewing machines to stitch them quickly,
the sixty sets of garments (thirty dress and thirty work outfits) would probably be worth twenty thousand dollars
in today's currency, maybe more. This was no ordinary riddle.</p>

<h4>And he said to them,</h4>

<h5>“Out of the eater came something to eat.</h5>

<h5>Out of the strong came something sweet.”</h5>

<h4>And in three days they could not solve the riddle.</h4>

<h6>- Judges 14:14</h6>

<p>The narrator lets us know that this was an intentional provocation by Samson
in order to trigger a war between Israel and the Philistines, a war he believed 
he could win, thanks to the divine strength God had given him.</p>

<p>Why focus on this riddle? Judges 14 uses the word riddle eight times. Daniel only uses the word
only twice. The whole Bible only uses it fifteen times. With over half the mentions, 
Judges 14 is riddle central. The trick with a riddle, a parable, or a saying of the wise is 
that it has a surface meaning and a deeper meaning, whether spiritual or prophetic. 
We are told the surface meaning. The eater was the lion that tried to eat Samson, but which he 
dispatched with his supernatural strength. Then days later, he passed by again and saw that bees
had made a nest in the lion's corpse and there was honey to be had, the sweet (honey) that came out of the strong (lion).</p>

<p>What is the prophetic meaning? If there is such a meaning, we have lots of grist. Prophecies of the future often
tell us how long the wait until some future event. They need either numbers or things that can be counted.
This chapter and the next, where the story concludes with the death of his wife and lots of other people,
have lots of numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>riddle: eight mentions</li>
<li>thirty: with reference to the wagered garments, mentioned six times</li>
<li>fourth: the fourth day of the feast, mentioned once</li>
<li>seven: with reference to days, mentioned twice</li>
<li>seventh: with reference to the last day of the feast, mentioned twice</li>
<li>three: with reference to the first three days of the feast, mentioned once</li>
<li>300: the foxes caught by Samson in Judges 15, tied to torches and used to burn their fields, mentioned once</li>
<li>3000: number of Israelites who betray and capture Samson in Judges 15, mentioned once</li>
<li>1000: Philistines slaughtered by Samson in Judges 15 with a jawbone, mentioned twice</li>
<li>twenty: years of Samson's rule as judge as stated in Judges 15, mentioned once</li>
</ul>

<p>With all those numbers to play with, a creative person can fabricate endless possible prophecies.
There is bound to be a way to get a subset to add or multiply up to the number of years until Christ,
but I wouldn't put too much credence in such arithmetic. Here are a few ideas that a brief internet search turned up:</p>

<p><strong>A prophecy of Samson's own fate</strong>. One writer says that the eater is Samson, and the food for eating that came from
him is the grain he ground while imprisoned by the Philistines years later, after Delilah's betrayal.</p>

<p><strong>A moral tale about hidden sin</strong>. Allan Johnson writes in <a href="https://laymansbible.wordpress.com/2013/12/21/samsons-riddle/">Samson's Riddle</a>
that Samson by his riddle is unintentionally revealing his own sin. He was raised by his parents to be a Nazirite.
The Nazirite vow included no cutting of the hair (which led to Samson losing his strength one day, courtesy of Delilah's shears),
no drinking fermented beverages like wine, and definitely no touching of corpses! 
By touching a dead lion to eat from the honeycomb attached to it, he became unclean. 
By telling a riddle about the whole affair, he was disclosing his unfaithfulness to God.
In this fashion, a man trying to conceal his actions by a riddle ends up shouting them to the world.
Won't God do the same with us?</p>

<h4>Therefore whatever you have said in the dark</h4>

<h4>shall be heard in the light, and what you have</h4>

<h4>whispered in private rooms</h4>

<h4>shall be proclaimed on the housetops.</h4>

<h6>- Luke 12:3</h6>

<p><strong>An End Times Prophecy</strong>. Bill Somers offers an interpretation that makes use of many of the symbols from the text, but seems off to me.
In his article <a href="https://www.gatewaysofhislight.com/etpv/billsomers/riddle1/">Samson's Riddle: The Revelation of Jesus Christ</a>, 
Somers makes these points (in my words):</p>

<ul>
<li>The dead lion is Jesus, called "the Lion of the tribe of Judah" in Revelation 5:5.</li>
<li>The honey is the sweetness of the scroll given to John by the angel: "And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey..." Revelation 10:10.</li>
<li>Since in Colossians it says that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, this sweet honey of wisdom is hidden in Christ, the one who was slain.</li>
<li>The unfaithful gentile bride of Samson is the Bride of Christ, whom he took to himself with a promise to cleanse her.</li>
<li>The deeper truths of the Bible are sealed until the end times. Thus the riddle could never be understood by the Philistines (the world) or even by the church (the bride).</li>
<li>Samson revealed the answer to the riddle to his bride on the seventh day of the feast, which is symbolically the seventh millennia of history, when Christ will open the seals on the scroll of Revelation.</li>
<li>The bride, like an evangelist, then shared the answer to the riddle with her people.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I keep searching, I will find more interpretations of Samson's riddle and get no closer to the truth.
My only clue has to do with Samson's strength. The fifth of the <a href="./seven-spirits.html">seven Spirits of God</a> 
is the Spirit of Might. Being the fifth, it points to the fifth millennia, when Christ lived and died and rose again.
Being fifth, it also points to the fifth pillar of wisdom, Ecclesiastes. That book has one place
that ties together marriage, work, might and a life of joy:</p>

<h4>Go, eat your bread with joy,</h4>

<h4>and drink your wine with a merry heart,</h4>

<h4>for God has already approved what you do.</h4>

<h4>Let your garments be always white.</h4>

<h4>Let not oil be lacking on your head.</h4>

<h4><strong>Enjoy life with the wife whom you love</strong>,</h4>

<h4>all the days of your vain life that he has</h4>

<h4>given you under the sun, because that is</h4>

<h4>your portion in life and in your toil at which</h4>

<h4>you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand</h4>

<h4>finds to do, <strong>do it with your might</strong>,</h4>

<h4>for there is no work or thought or knowledge</h4>

<h4>or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 9:7-10</h6>

<p>For all his might, Samson did not enjoy life with his wives.
He gloried more in his strength than in God who gave it to him.
If only Samson lived later and could have been taught by Psalm 19!</p>

<h4>In them he has set a tent for the sun,</h4>

<h4>which comes out like a <strong>bridegroom</strong> leaving his chamber,</h4>

<h4>and, like <strong>a strong man</strong>, runs its course with joy...</h4>

<h4>the fear of the Lord is clean,</h4>

<h5>enduring forever;</h5>

<h4>the rules of the Lord are true,</h4>

<h5>and righteous altogether.</h5>

<h4>More to be desired are they than gold,</h4>

<h5>even much fine gold;</h5>

<h4><strong>sweeter also than honey</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and drippings of the honeycomb</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Moreover, by them is your servant warned;</h4>

<h5>in keeping them there is great reward.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 19:4b-5,9-11</h6>

<p>The strong man in Psalm 19 is clean - no touching corpses. 
His honey is God's Word, and it warns him of danger, like marrying the wrong sort of woman.</p>

<p>None of this is the meaning of Samson's riddle, but it does touch on the meaning of Samson's life.
Tactically, he was brilliant at provoking fights that he knew he could win, of wreaking destruction.
Strategically, he was a mess. He did not know how to reach full maturity and put aside his
passions so that he could build something that would last. He had an insatiable lust for excitement,
danger, and death. Nothing could satisfy that lust. If one other Bible riddle is equal to Samson's, 
it may be this:</p>

<h4>The leech has two daughters:</h4>

<h5>Give and Give.</h5>

<h4>Three things are never satisfied;</h4>

<h5>four never say, “Enough”:</h5>

<h4>Sheol, the barren womb,</h4>

<h5>the land never satisfied with water,</h5>

<h5>and the fire that never says, “Enough.”</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 30:15-16</h6>

<p>The insatiable hunger is mirrored by this parable. 
The two daughters of the leech are Samson's two wives, leaching secrets out of him so that he could be destroyed.
The four things that can never say, "Enough!" showed up in his story as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sheol</strong> is the grave. Samson killed a lot of people. He kept feeding more lost souls to its hunger.</li>
<li><strong>The barren womb</strong> is the womb of Samson's first wife. Her actions led to her early death, a bride but not a mother.</li>
<li><strong>The land thirsting for water</strong> was Samson. His thirsts were lust for women and revenge, but also for water (Judges 15:18-20).</li>
<li><strong>Fire</strong> is the final insatiable entity. Samson catches foxes, ties burning torches to their tails, and sets them free to burn the fields and olive groves of his enemies. Later, her fellow Philistines burn Samson's faithless wife and father in retaliation. </li>
</ul>

<p>The story begins with Samson thirsting for a heathen woman and ends with him thirsting for water:</p>

<h4>And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the Lord and said,</h4>

<h5>“You have granted this great salvation by the hand</h5>

<h5>of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall</h5>

<h5>into the hands of the uncircumcised?”</h5>

<h4>And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi,</h4>

<h4>and water came out from it. And when he drank,</h4>

<h4>his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the</h4>

<h4>name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day.</h4>

<h4>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</h4>

<h6>- Judges 15:18-20</h6>

<p>Do you hear the arrogance in his demand for water?
How did God put up with him?</p>

<p>Jesus said that we are to hunger and thirst for righteousness. 
Samson had the thirst, but for all the wrong things.
We must not be like him, but we must thirst. We must pray - with humility - 
that God will split the rock of confusion, ignorance and exhaustion
and so satisfy our thirst for Him. When the water that wells up to eternal life
bubbles forth, then our spirit will revive.</p>
