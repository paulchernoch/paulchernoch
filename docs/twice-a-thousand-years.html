        <h1>Twice a Thousand Years</h1>
        <h2>Ecclesiastes 6</h2>
        
        
        <h2>The Seven Gates</h2>

<h4>Up from Earth's Centre through the seventh Gate</h4>

<h5>I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,</h5>

<h4>And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road;</h4>

<h5>But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate.</h5>

<h6>- The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</h6>

<p>As a teen, I loved The Rubaiyat, and the above quatrain was my favorite. Such mystery. What are the seven gates one must pass through?
What boon awaits the one who attains to sitting upon Saturn's throne? After reflecting long upon Ecclesiastes, I discovered that
it describes the course of life as passing through seven stages, which I call the <a href="./growth-pattern.html">Growth Pattern</a>. 
That pattern brings a person from infancy to full maturity, which you might liken to sitting upon a throne, master of your passions, your time
and the piece of the world you have built around you.</p>

<p>In what follows, mostly pulled from my books, there are the inevitable references to results from earlier in my work which may confuse.
Here is an outline of the process of discovery that led me to my conclusions.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Poem as Human Growth</strong>. Found (during a mind-mapping exercise) that the twenty-eight times from the poem in chapter 3 are parables. Their metaphorical meanings, grouped in quartets, define the process of growth from infancy to maturity for an individual human.</li>
<li><strong>Under the Sun as Punctuation</strong>. Found that the phrase "under the sun" appears twenty-eight times. It divides the majority of the book into twenty-eight sections of unequal length. Each section corresponds to one of the twenty-eight times. Thus the poem is the table of contents to Ecclesiastes.</li>
<li><strong>A Full Life</strong>. Found that the last three chapters of Ecclesiastes go beyond maturity to the end of life, describing the years of decline leading to death. Thus Ecclesiastes describes the full course of a life.</li>
<li><strong>A Catalog of Clocks</strong>. One thing halted my earlier attempts to understand history through the lens of the Bible. That was having no Biblical justification for the kinds of prophetic clocks that I have since discovered. I found that Ecclesiastes 1 has a catalog of the four major types of prophetic clocks, plus a mention of one other clock-like historical pattern.</li>
<li><strong>A Schema for History</strong>. Found that the course of one human life, as segmented by the poem, is a prophetic analogy to the course of Judeo-Christian Civilization. Made a rough match between historical events and the series of times, which I call a prophetic clock. The time period of the clock ran from early in the Jewish monarchy to the time of the end. This effort was guided by matching patterns of history to the poem, but without any textual basis to establish the timeline's start, end, and duration of each period.</li>
<li><strong>An Intricate Riddle</strong>. Discovered in Ecclesiastes 6 a sublime riddle. The answer to the riddle tells you when the prophetic clock started ticking and how long each of the twenty-eight periods of time would last. This required using the prior results to project the times of the poem onto the remaining text using the "under the sun" divisions. That repeated phrase was like the tick marks on a sundial. This then situates the riddle from chapter 6 in time relative to the start of the clock.</li>
<li><strong>A Fractal Composition</strong>. Discovered that time is composed fractally. While the first pattern that I discovered is the main one, this same pattern of times governs history at larger and smaller scales. Also, some of the examples of the pattern include the periods of productivity (chapters 10-11) and decline (chapters 11-12) into a longer pattern. Thus we have patterns for one life, modern Israel (Holocaust to the Christ's return), Judeo-Christian Civilization (from Solomon to Christ's return), and all of humanity (from the Creation to the new Creation).</li>
<li><strong>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</strong>. Found that the twenty-eight times, in order, form a hidden structure for seven books of the Bible: Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. This shared structure, plus the shared structure of the <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern of Jesus</a>, prove that those seven books are set apart in the Bible as a unit. Combined with many other similarities, the seven books can be proven to be the Seven Pillars of Wisdom named in Proverbs.</li>
<li><strong>Discipleship</strong>. Found that Paul's first seven letters (Romans to Colossians) each correspond to one of the seven phases of growth, as reported in <a href="./pauls-discipleship-program.html">Paul's Discipleship Program</a>. Thus each of the twenty-eight times and coarser grouping into seven phases has a spiritual analogy. Ecclesiastes teaches us materialistic human growth in the ways of this world. Paul teaches us spiritual growth in the context of community life within the church.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above process of discovery and refinement has required over a decade to reach the place I am at now. The riddle is about a man who does not want to live <em>twice a thousand years</em> 
if it means a joyless existence followed by a tragic end. This is the ultimate riddle of human fate to which Omar Khayyam alluded. This riddle is the gate I had to pass through
before I could unlock all the riches of wisdom that I have found. It is the hardest riddle I have ever solved. </p>

<h4>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;</h4>

<h5>to search out a matter is the glory of kings.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 25:2</h6>

<p>If I never solve another riddle, I will be content. Solving this one makes me feel like a king.</p>

<h2>Where I got stuck</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastes is a book of riddles. Unlike the poem by Omar Khayyam, if you unravel all its riddles, 
you will have unraveled that master-knot. You will learn deep things about human fate.</p>

<p>Over a decade ago ago, I tried to solve those riddles. I failed. In my failure, I had three insights into the problem which I wasn't sure were correct,
but they were. My insights were that these three things were important:</p>

<ul>
<li>To decipher the poem of the times in chapter 3 and its relation to the whole</li>
<li>To deduce the purpose of the repetition of "under the sun" throughout</li>
<li>To understand the conclusion, how to "fear God and Keep His commandments" followed from the rest, and how it is an attractive purpose for life</li>
</ul>

<p>My investigation into those mysteries fills the pages of <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. I summarized some of my findings in the chapter 
"Ecclesiastes 3: Knowing the Acceptable Time" in <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>. This article repeats part of that chapter.
It addresses the first two insights, but five riddles:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the outline of Ecclesiastes?</li>
<li>Why are the twenty-eight times times ordered as they are?</li>
<li>What do the times tell us about how to plan our lives?</li>
<li>Are the times prophetic?</li>
<li>If so, when does the period of time spoken of in the prophecy begin and end?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last riddle is the cleverest riddle I have ever solved. It is marvelous, not just for what it reveals,
but also because it opens the door to solving riddles all over the Bible. This one discovery set me on the path 
to discovering scores of prophetic clocks, identifying the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the structure of Paul's letters, and so much more.
Because of this riddle, I believe that Ecclesiastes is the mainspring of God's prophetic clock.</p>

<p>Behold the Master-Knot...</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Ecclesiastes 3: Knowing the Acceptable Time</h2>

<p>The Psalmist in 69:13 humbly asked the Lord for an answer “at an acceptable time”.
Ecclesiastes is all about what is acceptable during each time. Let us reflect on them.</p>

<h4>a time to be born, and a time to die;</h4>

<h4>a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;</h4>

<h4>a time to kill, and a time to heal;</h4>

<h4>a time to break down, and a time to build up;</h4>

<h4>a time to weep, and a time to laugh;</h4>

<h4>a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</h4>

<h4>a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;</h4>

<h4>a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</h4>

<h4>a time to seek, and a time to lose;</h4>

<h4>a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</h4>

<h4>a time to tear, and a time to sew;</h4>

<h4>a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</h4>

<h4>a time to love, and a time to hate;</h4>

<h4>a time for war, and a time for peace.</h4>

<h6>- (Ecclesiastes 3:2-8)</h6>

<p>To fit these twenty-eight times (or fourteen seasons, if you pair them) to history you
must know what they mean. Only once I had the meaning and a reasonable fit to history,
namely a start year, the duration of each period, and the end year, could I even spot the
riddle that confirmed my assumptions.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastes is shaped by several overlapping structures, making analysis difficult. It
conforms to the seven parts of the Harvest Pattern, but this article shall not make use of
that structure. It also follows a chronological structure patterned after a single human life.
Accordingly, it is divided into three unequal sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Days of Growth</strong> (1:1-10:5)</li>
<li><strong>Days of Maturity</strong> (10:6-11:7)</li>
<li><strong>Days of Darkness</strong> (11:8-12:14)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first section is divided into twenty-eight sections by the phrase “under the sun” and
ends with an assessment: have you by middle age become a wise servant?</p>

<p>The second section has two parts: building your house and diversified investing (cast
your bread upon the waters). It, too, ends with an assessment. Did you reach this stage
having planned for the long term?</p>

<p>The third section has two parts, set off by the word “Remember”. Only by reflecting on
all that came before in your life can you endure the dark days to come: failing health and
a fading mind. This section ends with a final progress report. Our whole life is to be
judged.</p>

<p>Understanding this structure is critical. Prophetic patterns hidden in Ecclesiastes have
two possibilities. One is that they form an analogy of an entire human life, from birth to
death. Applied to a civilization, that includes its rise and fall. A second pattern is
suggested by chapter 3. The twenty-eighth time of peace is followed not by decline and
death but by immediate entrance into eternity:</p>

<h4>“He has made everything beautiful in its time.</h4>

<h4>Also, he has put eternity into man's heart,</h4>

<h4>yet so that he cannot find out what God has done</h4>

<h4>from the beginning to the end.”</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 3:11</h6>

<p>In <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, both are explored. Unsaved humanity, called in Revelation “the inhabitants of
the earth”, is bound up in a civilization that will perish. It has already reached its peak
and its decline and fall will soon begin, if they have not already begun.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the church is destined for glory. These final cataclysms as the world
falls apart will be employed by God to perfect his bride and make her radiant. Thus the
history of Israel and the Church conforms not to the whole of Ecclesiastes but just the
twenty-eight times that end with peace.</p>

<p>Here is what the times mean for a single human as they grow into an adult. Each group
of four times corresponds to a seven-year stage of life. They define the principal (but not
sole) challenge facing a person at that stage. Collectively, they form a developmental model
for life.</p>

<p>Once I saw that the times had an overarching meaning and that it was sequential in
time, the next step was clear. I had to see if it was a parable disclosing God’s pattern for
history. From the Bible and church history, a few matches between Solomon’s times and
world events suggested themselves, beginning with a time to uproot. When the prophets
speak of uprooting, it almost always is a reference to exile and to the Babylonian Captivity
in particular. Then the time to weep must be when Jesus was crucified, or the time of
Rachel weeping for her children, or perhaps the destruction of Herod’s temple and
Jerusalem by Emperor Titus in 70 AD. The time to tear seems like a good match for the
Protestant Reformation and subsequent wars. After that, the time to speak would be the
age of Christian missions, while the time to love is the time we live in now, when God has
poured out wealth and facilitated advances in education, medicine, science, agriculture
and every other area of human endeavor, extending our lifespan and setting many free
from slavery.</p>
