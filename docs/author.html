        <h1>Author</h1>
        
        
        
        <p>My name is <strong>Paul Anton Chernoch</strong>. I love my savior, my family, and my church. When I get distracted from those important people, it is because of my other loves: numbers and writing. My love for mathematics I learned from my mother, Martha, who earned a degree in that subject from Duke University. In third or fourth grade, she taught me how to extract square roots by hand. That made me the only kid in my school who could do that. That one thing she taught me made me feel special and gave me the confidence to excel at math. Pardon a bit of foolishness as I honor her memory with a product of my imagination.</p>

<p>During the four years that preceded my religious conversion, I only picked up the Bible twice. The second time was to read Psalm 23, about the good shepherd who leads his lost sheep back to safety. The danger in that Psalm is the valley of the shadow of death; my personal valley was the deep depression that nearly kept me from graduating college. I believe that reading Psalm 23 was a turning point for me. It was to me a faint call of the shepherd in the distance, an early step toward salvation. By a strange coincidence, I would give my heart to Jesus at age 23.</p>

<p>Jesus is both man and God, will come a second time, and as the eternal Word is found in two testaments, old and new. <em>Jesus is the number two</em>.</p>

<p>The Father is the one "who is and who was and who is to come" as it says in Revelation 1 and 4. The thrice holy God is past, present and future and the head of the trinity. <em>The Father is the number three.</em></p>

<p>The Holy Spirit has many dimensions, called the seven spirits of God in Isaiah 11:2 and sent into the whole earth in Revelation. <em>The Spirit is the number seven.</em></p>

<p>What do you get if you collect Psalm 23 and the numbers for each member of the Trinity, with Jesus' number included twice, and multiply them together? </p>

<p><strong>2 x 2 x 3 x 7 x 23 = 1932</strong></p>

<p>1932 is the year my mathematical mother was born!</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I earned my BS in Physics from MIT in 1987. For this I owe my father a debt of gratitude. He dedicated his life to applied physics. At General Electric, he invented the face pumped laser, much more powerful than all earlier lasers. That enabled him to be the first person to cut a hole through a diamond with a laser, paricipate in designing the first laser-guided missile system, and be the first to cut holes through aircraft engine steel. He was a good teacher, too.</p>

<p>On the surface, knowledge of physics and mathematics may seem an irrelevant credential for an author of books on theology. Spiritual truths are spiritually discerned. However, consider Samson. He was as strong when fighting the Philistines for God as he was when protecting his sheep from predators for his family. Strength is strength. Thanks to God, I have a strong analytical mind. Thirty plus years as a software engineer for companies in industries like accounting, finance, insurance, healthcare, logistics, travel, education, and energy have tested and sharpened those analytical skills. One year the software that I was lead designer for helped my employer shave a billion dollars off their corporate liability by optimizing the process of abandoning deep sea oil wells. That is a measure of the attention to detail and creativity that I carry over into my study of God's word.</p>

<p>My MIT education is noteworthy for another reason. Most of my professors and classmates were agnostics or atheists. I did not become a Christian until my fifth year as a student there. Despite the intellectual force of such a proud and accomplished community, I came to believe in God and the truthfulness and infallibility of the Bible, even in the matter of the origins of life on earth. Learning apologetic responses to the most potent critiques of Christianity on the planet became a survival skill and sharpened my understanding of Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>I also completed classes in Systematic Theology, Church History and New Testament theology at Gordon Conwell's Center for Urban Ministerial Education.</p>

<h2>Ministry</h2>

<p>Over the years I have served in my church as head usher, world outreach chairman, Bible study leader, Sunday school teacher, and nursery volunteer, to mention a few roles. I went on two short term mission trips to Romania. I also helped produce three episodes of a Christian TV talk show. </p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>I took up writing as my principal hobby around 2004. I began by writing Christian fantasy novels, before shifting to nonfiction works of theology. I have also helped other writers by editing their books and converting them into e-books, including a book on theology, one on outlining a novel, a work of poetry, a book on training your diebetic alert dog, a medieval romance and a western. I have been an active member at <strong>ChristianWriters.com</strong> since 2005. </p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p>My wife Tina and I have been married for thirty years. We have three amazing daughters. One is a poet and teacher with an MFA from UMASS Boston. The next has a masters from Northeastern in Environmental Studies. The youngest is finishing her art degree at UMASS. Raising them while survivng unemployment, financial hardships, health crises, and all the rest was my real education. A degree from the House of Mourning is of greater value than an MIT diploma.</p>
