        <h1>Hannah's Song</h1>
        
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-04-12</p>
        
        <p>Note: This article both summarizes and amplifies ideas first expressed in the chapter 
"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. That is the final chapter and 
thus concludes in setting forth the most important ideas in that book. I consider discovering the 
meaning behind the words of the Prophetess Hannah to be one of the most important revelations to 
spring from all my years of studying the Bible. Of all the words in the Bible touching on the 
subject of God's wisdom, hers may be the most profound.</p>

<h2>One Wise Woman</h2>

<p>Everyone wants to be the greatest. Yet how can you become the greatest at something unless 
you know who holds the current title? That is why we keep lists. The Guinness Book of World Records
is the bible for people of ambition. We Christians have our own Bible, which tells us that Solomon 
was the wisest man who every lived (besides Jesus, according to Matthew 12:42). Good luck beating him out!</p>

<p>Isn't it curious that the Bible never tells us who was the wisest woman of all time? 
We have the words of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs, but she is not a real person (or so we think). 
She could be one of the Seven Spirits of God given in Isaiah 11:2, but that either makes her an angel or a facet of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p>If we could call up Solomon, would he know? Oh dear...</p>

<h4>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher,</h4>

<h4>while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things—</h4>

<h4>which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found.</h4>

<h4>One man among a thousand I found,</h4>

<h5><strong>but a woman among all these I have not found</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 7:27-28</h6>

<p>Solomon couldn't find ANY wise women! </p>

<p>Can we do better? First, we need to have a way to measure her wisdom. 
Let's assess what was unique in the contributions given by several wise men,
then see if any women come close in offering anything comparable.</p>

<p>From my study of Ecclesiastes, I discovered a seven-part Growth Pattern.
This pattern of Solomon's, distilled from the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3, 
describes the phases of life that all people go through from birth to maturity. 
It also speaks prophetically about the rise and fall of civilizations. 
Pretty cool, eh? (See <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em> for details, or elsewhere on this website for a summary.)</p>

<p>From my study of Matthew and Job, I discovered a seven-part Harvest Pattern, taught by Jesus
through his parables. It teaches us how to overcome obstacles and reap a spiritual harvest.
It also has prophetic ramifications and governs the order of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.</p>

<p>While not the wisest, Moses was very wise. He gave us the Ten Commandments.
In <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, I showed how the plagues and commandments define the structure
for God's acts of judgment against a series of world empires. They also prophesy the cadence
of God's judgments against Israel and the Church. Furthermore, those commandments govern the
organization of material in the Gospel of Matthew. (See the chapter "Matthew and the Law of Christ"
in <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em> for evidence to support this, as well as the following assertion.) 
Lastly, the Growth and Harvest Patterns each fit within the commandments, snug as a bug in a rug. </p>

<p>Collectively, Moses, Solomon and Jesus gave us the principal prophetic patterns that frame 
Lady Wisdom's House. Is there a lady out there who is in their league?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>Her name is Hannah.</p>

<h2>A Woman of Sacrifice</h2>

<p>Hannah was not on my radar until shortly after I discovered the Pillars of Wisdom. 
I was seeking additional supporting evidence to bolster my claims. Thus I searched the Bible for
every mention of the word pillar to see if they had anything to add or subtract from my ideas.
This led me to Hannah. Her short prayer of ten verses is uplifting, indicates great faith, but
never conveyed to me the ring of significance and gravitas that I found in an Isaiah or Jeremiah.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I never appreciated how wise Solomon was until after years spent deciphering his words.
I knew of Solomon's wisdom by reputation, not by experience. My conclusion was humbling:</p>

<p><strong>You cannot appreciate how wise someone is unless you possess like wisdom.</strong></p>

<p>Though I am not as wise as Solomon, I am now much wiser than I was when I was younger.
As my wisdom has grown, so too has my estimation of how great and subtle are the words of that king.
This is no different from my attitude towards Hannah. She appears in only two chapters, 1 Samuel 1-2.</p>

<p>In the first chapter, we learn that Hannah, like Job, suffers a sovereign affliction. It says that
the Lord had closed her womb. Like Job, she also endured scorn for her condition, from her 
husband's other wife. The distress that this caused could have embittered her, destroyed her faith
and made her lash out. Instead, by her suffering her true self was revealed and perfected. 
She prayed. She fasted. She wept before the Lord. She offered a double sacrifice. Then she made a vow.</p>

<h4>And she vowed a vow and said,</h4>

<h5>“O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed</h5>

<h5><strong>look on</strong> the affliction of your servant</h5>

<h5>and <strong>remember</strong> me</h5>

<h5>and <strong>not forget</strong> your servant,</h5>

<h5>but will give to your servant a son,</h5>

<h5>then I will give him to the Lord</h5>

<h5>all the days of his life,</h5>

<h5>and no razor shall touch his head.”</h5>

<h6>- 1 Samuel 1:11</h6>

<p>Can you imagine a powerless woman going up to her husband and saying that she has
just made a unilateral decision. She is going to become a surrogate mother, 
give the baby up shortly after it is born, and not be paid a cent?
That is what Hannah was promising God. Abraham was asked to offer up his son Isaac in sacrifice, 
but at the last minute was given a ram to exchange for the life of his son. 
Hannah actually gave away her firstborn son. In my book, her faith was every bit as great as
that of Abraham's.</p>

<p>In her prayer, Hannah, like Job, longs to be heard by God. In <em>Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life</em>, 
I catalogued the many ways that a person can communicate with God
or God talk back in response. Two powerful ways are suffering and sacrifice.
<strong>Suffering</strong> is one way that God communicates great wisdom to us, but it only works if you
retain your faith; only by faith can you hear what God is saying. <strong>Sacrifice</strong> is one way that we speak to God. 
It demonstrates our loyalty, resolve and sincerity.</p>

<p>Hannah went above and beyond. I would not have understood this about Hannah had I not had my own
miraculous experience of healing with God. Just as God sealed up Hannah's womb,
He took away all hearing in my left ear for a month in 2005. He led me to read Exodus 4,
where it says that God makes people deaf. Once I realized that it was God's will that I be deaf
in that ear (and possibly lose hearing in my other ear), what did I do? </p>

<p>I trusted God. I believed that He had a good plan for me, whether to heal me or not.
Sitting in the doctor's office, I felt peace. My body was damaged but I left that office 
with a heart that was whole. In an act of surrender, I also stopped praying for God to heal me.</p>

<p>Two days later my hearing returned. Compare this to Hannah's story:</p>

<h4>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved,</h4>

<h4>and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be</h4>

<h4>a drunken woman. And Eli said to her,</h4>

<h5>“How long will you go on being drunk?</h5>

<h5>Put your wine away from you.”</h5>

<h4>But Hannah answered,</h4>

<h5>“No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit.</h5>

<h5>I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,</h5>

<h5>but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.</h5>

<h5>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman,</h5>

<h5>for all along I have been speaking out of my</h5>

<h5>great anxiety and vexation.”</h5>

<h4>Then Eli answered,</h4>

<h5>“Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition</h5>

<h5>that you have made to him.”</h5>

<h4>And she said,</h4>

<h5>“Let your servant find favor in your eyes.”</h5>

<h4><strong>Then the woman went her way and ate,</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>and her face was no longer sad.</strong></h4>

<h6>- 1 Samuel 1:13-18</h6>

<p>Without dream or vision, angelic visit, miracle or theophany, Hannah believed.
She ended her fast and was no longer sad. She walked away from Shiloh
with the same peace that I had when I left my doctor's office.
That is the measure of Hannah's faith.</p>

<h2>A Woman of Power</h2>

<p>When a person endures great suffering and yet holds fast to God in faith, 
they receive a power from on high that can transform the people around them.
I first learned this lesson from Janet Sullivan, a member of our church who 
suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. I visited her at her nursing facility
in Somerville, MA. I have never seen someone in such physical pain. 
Mere months away from death, she held fast to her faith. Right up until the end, 
she bore witness to Jesus Christ when friends and family visited her. 
All she asked of me when I visited was that I read to her from the Bible. 
Like Job, God's words were more precious to her than anything else in this world. 
After I left her place the first time, I was overcome with weeping. 
I have never cried so hard as I did for that poor woman. </p>

<p>But she was not poor! A half hour after I left her, as I walked over the BU Bridge
near my church, joy flooded my soul. It remained for a whole week.
At her funeral, one of her friends said something with which we all agreed.
"When you were with Janet, it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."</p>

<p>The day I met Janet Sullivan, I was delivered from ten years of depression.
A suffering, faithful Christian is like a broken jar of perfume; they fill the
whole house with their aroma. It was this insight, learned by Janet's example,
that unlocked a huge part of the book of Job for me. It solved the mystery
of whether Elihu spoke for God or himself. You see Job was another broken jar 
of perfume. The Holy Spirit poured out of Job and into Elihu, enabling Elihu to
prophecy the truths that would comfort Job.</p>

<h4>For I am full of words;</h4>

<h5><strong>the spirit within me constrains me</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;</h4>

<h5><strong>like new wineskins ready to burst</strong>.</h5>

<h4>I must speak, that I may find relief;</h4>

<h5>I must open my lips and answer.</h5>

<h6>- Job 32:18-20</h6>

<p>Can't you just feel the power of the Holy Spirit stirring within him, 
impossible to be contained? That is the power that flows out of the
suffering but faithful soul. And what power did the Lord grant Job in the end?
As near as I can tell, Job was the first person in history to whom God
gave the authority and power to forgive sins. On top of that, Job's 
book is believed to be older than Genesis, the first book of the Bible to be 
written. All that God gave to Job.</p>

<p>With all that as background, what did God give Hannah?</p>

<p>For one, he gave her the wisdom to raise a righteous son.
After Samuel was weaned, she delivered him into the care of Eli to live at the 
temple in Shiloh. What kind of a father was Eli? God took the lives of his 
two sons because they were selfish and profane, disgracing the office of 
priest entrusted to them. Any good character that Samuel learned, he learned 
from his mother Hannah. To the Jews of that time, a child may be weaned anywhere
from age two to five. So Hannah had Samuel for no more than five years.
So great was her love and example of faith that her influence remained with
him the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Lady Wisdom says in Proverbs, "By me kings reign." Samuel would anoint first Saul 
and then David to the kingship. Without Hannah's faith and sacrifice, there would be
no prophet Samuel.</p>

<p>After Hannah gave away her son, she could have mourned her loss the rest of her days.
She could have retreated into melancholy, regretting her decision.
Instead she uttered ten verses so subtle, I doubt I will ever plumb their depths
of profundity and power...</p>

<h2>A Woman of Prophecy</h2>

<p>In the verses that follow, I have added section headings.
There is a story behind the words that I chose, which we shall get to soon.
In what follows, Hannah speaks of seven reversals, of a world turned upside down.
What few realize is that it is her words of power that changed the world.
They are God's words and God's power, but he gave them to her and she made them her own.
After you read them, I will explain how these words take the kernels of wisdom
from Moses, Solomon and Jesus and weave them into a single fabric.
That means that Hannah spoke out words whose wisdom equals the sum of the wisdom
of those three men's words.</p>

<p>That makes Hannah one of the two wisest women who ever lived. 
(Have I hooked you yet?)</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<h4><sup>1</sup> And Hannah prayed and said,</h4>

<h4>“My heart exults in the Lord;</h4>

<h5>my horn is exalted in the Lord.</h5>

<h4>My mouth derides my enemies,</h4>

<h5>because I rejoice in your salvation.</h5>

<h4><sup>2</sup> “There is none holy like the Lord:</h4>

<h5>for there is none besides you;</h5>

<h5>there is no rock like our God.</h5>

<h4><sup>3</sup> Talk no more so very proudly,</h4>

<h5>let not arrogance come from your mouth;</h5>

<h4>for the Lord is a God of knowledge,</h4>

<h5>and by him actions are weighed.</h5>

<p><strong>First Reversal: Security &amp; Preparation</strong></p>

<h4><sup>4</sup> The bows of the mighty are broken,</h4>

<h5>but the feeble bind on strength.</h5>

<p><strong>Second Reversal: Ability &amp; Plowing</strong></p>

<h4><sup>5</sup> Those who were full</h4>

<h5>have hired themselves out for bread,</h5>

<h4>but those who were hungry</h4>

<h5>have ceased to hunger.</h5>

<p><strong>Third Reversal: Stability &amp; Planting</strong></p>

<h4><strong>The barren has borne seven</strong>,</h4>

<h5>but she who has many children is forlorn.</h5>

<p><strong>Fourth Reversal: Amity &amp; Pouring</strong></p>

<h4><sup>6</sup> The Lord kills and brings to life;</h4>

<h5>he brings down to Sheol and raises up.</h5>

<p><strong>Fifth Reversal: Opportunity &amp; Plucking</strong></p>

<h4><sup>7</sup> The Lord makes poor and makes rich;</h4>

<h5>he brings low and he exalts.</h5>

<p><strong>Sixth Reversal: Community &amp; Producing a Harvest</strong></p>

<h4><sup>8</sup> He raises up the poor from the dust;</h4>

<h5>he lifts the needy from the ash heap</h5>

<h4>to make them sit with princes</h4>

<h5>and inherit a seat of honor.</h5>

<p><strong>Interlude</strong></p>

<h4>For <strong>the pillars of the earth</strong> are the Lord's,</h4>

<h5>and on them he has set the world.</h5>

<p><strong>Seventh Reversal (a chiasm): Loyalty &amp; Peace</strong></p>

<h4><sup>9</sup> “He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,</h4>

<h5>but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness,</h5>

<h5>for not by might shall a man prevail.</h5>

<h4><sup>10</sup> The adversaries of the Lord</h4>

<h5>shall be broken to pieces;</h5>

<h6>against them he will thunder in heaven.</h6>

<h4>The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;</h4>

<h5>he will give strength to his king</h5>

<h6>and exalt the horn of his anointed.”</h6>

<h6>- 1 Samuel 2:1-10</h6>

<h2>The Big picture</h2>

<p>What is the big picture? In a riddle, Hannah prophesied the existence of the seven pillars
of wisdom before six of them had been written. Her prophecy was delivered 
a century before Solomon wrote Proverbs, where they are finally named explicitly.
You don't see it?</p>

<p>In verse 5, we have <em>"The barren has borne seven."</em> This verse is close to the heart of Hannah.
She was "the barren" and now she is not, praise God! Seven means completeness, 
an overflowing harvest of children. From this part of Hannah's riddle we get the number seven.</p>

<p>We know that the second half of verse eight is significant because it breaks pattern.
It interrupts the seven reversals of fortune, falling between the sixth and the seventh.
In verse 8 we read, <em>"For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world."</em> 
From this part of Hannah's riddle we get the pillars. From Proverbs we know that it is upon
wisdom that God established the heavens and the earth. Wisdom is their foundation. 
Thus by appearing just before the seventh reversal and because of the emotional connection
of Hannah to the verse about the barren bearing seven, we have the seven pillars of wisdom.</p>

<h2>The Introduction</h2>

<p>If a little wordplay was all it took to match Hannah's prayer to the seven pillars of wisdom,
her words would be curious, but not profound. The above connection that I found to the 
Seven Pillars of Wisdom is merely what drew me in. Once I made the initial connection, the
deeper meaning tumbled out. </p>

<ul>
<li>The prayer has ten verses. Each verse matches its corresponding commandment ala the Law Pattern, and in one case, matching Exodus plague. (I did not notice that concordance until I wrote this article.)</li>
<li>The seven reversals match the seven phases of the Solomon's Growth Pattern. The name of the growth phase is the first word after the colon in the label for each reversal.</li>
<li>The seven reversals also match the seven phases of Jesus' Harvest Pattern. The name of the Harvest Phase follows the ampersand in each reversal label.</li>
<li>The seven reversals also correspond to seven eras of history, each lasting 480 years, beginning with Samuel's birth ca 1080 BC. They prophesy an important event in each era.</li>
<li>The interlude corresponds to an eighth era of history lasting 120 years, an era that saw a marked improvement in the lot of women.</li>
</ul>

<p>The three patterns, Harvest, Law and Growth, show up twice. First they are identified in the
introduction, then laid out in detail in the reversals (or in the case of the Law pattern, the entire prayer). </p>

<p><strong>The Harvest.</strong> Verse 1 says, "I rejoice in your salvation". In Matthew, Jesus is the 
Lord of the Harvest. Whether sending workers out into the harvest, or sending angels with nets,
or sending disciples out with the Great Commission, Jesus is all about bringing in a 
harvest of souls. He is the savior and this verse tells us that the savior and his
Harvest Pattern are here.</p>

<p><strong>The Law.</strong> Verse 2 says, "There is no rock like our God." The Law is the foundation of Lady Wisdom's House, 
the bedrock which protects it from the storm. The Ten Commandments were 
carved upon tablets of stone. Then there are the words "there is none besides you". 
This echoes the commandment in Exodus 20:3, which says, "You shall have no other gods before me."
This tells us that the Law Pattern is here.</p>

<p><strong>Growth in Wisdom.</strong> Verse 3 says, "for the Lord is a God of knowledge". This explicitly 
focuses us on wisdom, Solomon's specialty. </p>

<p>The body of the prayer has seven reversals, signifying a struggle, even a war.
The introduction describes the combatants in three opposing pairs.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first pair of adversaries are Hannah's own heart, which is "in the Lord" and her enemies, whose hearts are not. When she says that her "horn is exalted", that brings to mind the trumpets blown to announce a charge.</li>
<li>The second pair of adversaries are the Lord God, who is like a rock, and what? Nothing! Nothing can oppose him for there is "none holy like the Lord".</li>
<li>The third pair of adversaries are proud, arrogant talkers on the one hand, and the "God of knowledge" on the other. The declaration "by him actions are weighed" carries us into the body of the prayer, where God's actions of exalting the weak will be compared to the actions of those who oppose him. The seven reversals are like the scales God uses to weigh all men's deeds.</li>
</ol>

<p>I completely overlooked the introductory verses in my analysis in <em>Peace</em>. 
When solving riddles, it is not wise to overlook anything.</p>

<h2>Hannah Understands the Law</h2>

<p>The weighing of actions spoken of in verse 3 speaks to the very function of Law.
Now consider its particulars. </p>

<hr/>

<p>When it occurred to me to check whether the commandments line up with Hannah's prayer, I expected to not find a match.
A quick internet search did not turn up anyone else making this connection.
What are the odds that something so strikingly simple as this for the structure of her speech has never been seen before?
I spent hours analyzing this prayer a few years ago and never spotted it. How happy am I that God showed this to me!</p>

<p>What can we take away from this? Hannah firmly believed that the basis of her hope was God's law.
His law is His bond. It is His promise. She saw that law not as a set of constraints, but as the 
liberating force that it really is. Oh, how wonderful is her great cry of relief! The barren has borne seven!
How marvelous that it lines up with the command to honor your father and mother. She saw that we do not honor our
parents alone. God steps in alongside us and brings honor to parents by his love and grace. 
His grace made Hannah, whose name means grace, into a gracious mother who poured her heart into loving a son
whom she could not keep. And God still honors mothers today, just as he did Hannah long ago.</p>

<h2>Hannah Understands Motherhood</h2>

<p>When you look at the whole prayer, not skipping the introduction, you also see how Hannah weaves
in the metaphor of pregnancy. Yes, she speaks of the barren woman bearing seven, but it goes 
beyond that one verse. If we look at the structure of the prayer, there are changes at these positions:</p>

<ul>
<li>between the third and fourth verses we go from oppositions to reversals</li>
<li>in the middle of the eighth verse, between the sixth and seventh reversals, we have the interlude about the pillars of the earth</li>
<li>the ninth and tenth verses form the final reversal, a chiasm</li>
</ul>

<p>We can compare this structure to the course of a pregnancy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Verse 1</strong>: My heart exults in the Lord. Hannah is overjoyed to conceive.</li>
<li><strong>Verses 1-3</strong>: The first trimester. These verses do not have reversals (like labor pains or baby movements). During this trimester, women cannot yet feel the baby move.</li>
<li><strong>Verses 4-5</strong>: The second trimester (reversals one to three). Hannah says, "the feeble bind on strength". Now she feels the baby, as the quickening comes between the 16th and 25th week, but as early as the 13th week. She feels alternately happy and "forlorn" (verse 5), as it is an emotional time.</li>
<li><strong>Verses 6-8a</strong>: The third trimester (reversals  four to six). Hannah says, "The Lord... brings to life."</li>
<li><strong>Verse 8b</strong>: Hannah gives birth to Samuel. As a great and faithful prophet, he would grow up to be one of the "pillars of the earth", "sit with princes" and "inherit a seat of honor".</li>
<li><strong>Verse 9</strong>: Hannah recovers during the post partum laying-in period. "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones" sounds like Samuel's father protecting his newborn son, even tickling his toes.</li>
<li><strong>Verse 10</strong>: Samuel grows up and fulfills his destiny. First to "judge" the people. Second, to "exalt the horn of his anointed" when he anointed two kings over Israel, Saul and David. </li>
</ul>

<p>From this analysis, we see that Hannah has interpreted her pregnancy as giving birth to a new age for her people.
Her son would help the nation transition from a group of tribes ruled by judges to one nation ruled by a king.
This is the near term prophecy that we can see in her words. I overlooked this crucial, basic layer of meaning
when I wrote of my initial findings two years ago. The metaphor of pregnancy unifies the whole prayer, which
means that if there is a second, long-term prophecy to be found here, it must also bring in the whole prayer.</p>

<h2>Defining A Prophetic Clock</h2>

<p>In <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, I set forth hermeneutical rules for discovering and 
interpreting a prophetic clock. Among those principles are these. The riddles in the text should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the historical event that defines when the clock begins.</li>
<li>Identify how many time periods are in the clock.</li>
<li>Identify how long each time period lasts.</li>
<li>Have a unifying theme.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have already seen that there are two unifying themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ten Commandments</li>
<li>The birth of a nation</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination tells us that the new nation will be a theocracy. </p>

<p><strong>Start Year</strong>. What about the start year? That is where I went wrong in my previous book.
Starting with verse four, I matched prophecies correctly to history but skipped over the first three verses.
Why? Part of the pattern that I found in her prayer matches Solomon's Growth Pattern.
There was nothing in the prayer to suggest that it should start with Solomon's Temple (960 BC) or the Creation, 
so the logical place to start was with the birth of Samuel, ca 1080 BC. However, now that we see the Ten Commandments
as part of the structure, we have evidence that points to an earlier start. The more <strong>appropriate start for the
clock is with the Exodus</strong>, when those commandments were given.</p>

<p>According to my calculations, the Exodus occurred in 1447 BC. Despite my best efforts, I may be off by a few years.
To keep the numbers round and to align it with dozens of other spiritual clocks from my books, 
we shall <strong>start this clock in 1440 BC</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Number of Periods</strong>. Clocks that use Solomon's times, depending on whether they are divided into seven, 
fourteen or twenty-eight eras, usually have periods whose duration is 480, 240 or 120 years, respectively. 
In my previous analysis, it seemed sensible to respect the peculiarity of the prayer's structure. 
It broke pattern between the sixth and seventh reversals, with the interlude that speaks of the pillars of the earth.
I concluded then that there were eight periods. If we now add in the first three verses, we will get <strong>eleven periods</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Duration of Periods.</strong> Now in Ecclesiastes, Solomon used fourteen pairs of opposites. 
Such opposites resemble the reversals in Hannah's prayer.
However, because the interlude does not have a reversal, it seemed right to make it a different length of time from the rest.
If Samuel was born about 1080 BC, then if the extra period for the pillar is 120 years, not 480 years as for the 
reversals, the end of this clock would synchronize with the end of Solomon's clock.
It turns out that this extra 120 era is one of the most eventful eras in the history of the church: 
the missionary era of 1800-1920 AD, when the abolition movement began to root out slavery and 
women began to be granted more rights, including the right to own property separate from their husbands 
(starting with New York State in 1848 AD) and the right to vote (1920 AD).</p>

<p>It fits. If we also make the first three verses into shorter periods of 120 years, they also fit.</p>

<p>There is a good subjective reason why the periods that are parts of reversals last longer than the others.
Once that baby starts kicking, those months seem to drag on forever!</p>

<p><strong>Clock Definition</strong>. To summarize, we have a prophetic clock with these broad features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starts in 1440 BC near the Exodus.</li>
<li>Has eleven periods.</li>
<li>The first three periods last 120 years each.</li>
<li>The first six reversals last 480 years each, or 240 years per each half a reversal.</li>
<li>The interlude with the pillars lasts 120 years</li>
<li>The seventh reversal lasts 480 years</li>
<li>The clock ends in 2400 AD (though the last period might be cut short by Jesus' return)</li>
</ul>

<p>The seventh reversal is a chiasm, meaning it follows an A-B-B'-A' pattern. 
The first and last parts are about the good, while the second and third parts are about the wicked.
That means that we really have two reversals here. Instead of adding more time to the clock,
these last two verses go into greater detail about the same era.
As we shall see, the seven reversals correspond to seven quartets of times from Ecclesiastes 3.
Thus the last reversal is for the times to love, to hate, for war and for peace.
That quartet has the pattern good-bad-bad-good, just like verses 9 and 10 with their pattern of reversals.</p>

<h2>Hannah's Prophetic Clock</h2>

<p>It is now time to reveal Hannah's extended prophetic clock.
The first three verses are not prophetic; they are backwards looking.
They anchor Hannah's calendar in the past, going back to the Exodus, showing that
what follows is a continuation of God's unfolding plan.</p>

<p>Before the clock, here is a review of the Harvest and Growth Patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li>Each Harvest Phase also matches a Bible book (its corresponding Pillar book)</li>
<li>Each Harvest Phase matches one of the Seven Spirits of God named in Isaiah 11:2</li>
<li>Each Growth phase is built from four times taken from the poem in Ecclesiastes 3</li>
<li>Each Growth phase lasts seven years in a typical person's life</li>
</ul>

<p>These patterns apply literally to individual people and figuratively to nations, the church and whole civilizations.
So just as Hannah is describing the growth of a baby within, she is also prophesying the birth and growth of our civilization.</p>

<h2>Objections</h2>

<p><strong>Specificity</strong>. One objection to the above associations is that all times in history will display variations of these reversals.
The answer is that the eras associated with these reversals are the ultimate, definitive examples of these
themes.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>First era</strong>. The Exodus will go down as the most obviously miraculous salvation of a people in history until Christ comes again.</li>
<li><strong>Fourth era</strong>. The creation, rise and fall of the Kingdom of Israel is the premiere event of the era of the first reversal and the most prominent subject of prophecy beside the promise of a messiah.</li>
<li><strong>Fifth era</strong>. The silencing of the prophets between the time of Malachi and the birth of John the Baptist is the distinctive feature of the <strong>second reversal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sixth era</strong>. The birth of a new prophet to an aged, barren woman and the miraculous virgin birth of the messiah in a barren, conquered land are the principle events in the era of the <strong>third reversal</strong>, and the most significant event in all history.</li>
<li><strong>Eighth era</strong>. Through his vow of poverty in this <strong>fifth reversal</strong>, Saint Francis of Assisi embraced the life of one whom <em>"the Lord makes poor"</em> and led the way for people to renounce worldly wealth for the kingdom of God.</li>
<li><strong>Ninth era</strong>. Enabling the powerless to <em>"sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor"</em> via representative democracy as a result of the American Revolution during the time of the <strong>sixth reversal</strong> certainly turned the world upside down.</li>
<li><strong>Tenth era</strong>. The establishment of many <em>"strong pillars of the earth"</em>, the Protestant churches, in the era of the <strong>interlude</strong>, via a massive, worldwide missionary enterprise and the abolition of slavery were the most revolutionary events of that or any era.</li>
<li><strong>Eleventh era</strong>. When the Lord returns to <em>"judge the ends of the earth"</em> as his Father <em>"[exalts] the horn of his anointed"</em> at the end of the <strong>seventh reversal</strong>, that will be the most glorious event in all of history.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is evident that Hannah's rough sketch of history touches on the most prominent features of God's plan for the ages.</p>

<p><strong>Mismatch</strong>. Do Hannah's two-part reversals really match Solomon's four-part pairs of reversals? 
This is a feature of her wording that is easily overlooked. A few of Hannah's reversals are actually
four-part, using parallelism. How do hers line up against Solomon's?</p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes 3, there are good times and bad times. Sometimes the "good" time comes first, sometimes last. 
Since they come in pairs of opposites, there are four possible sequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad to good, bad to good</li>
<li>Bad to good, good to bad</li>
<li>Good to bad, good to bad</li>
<li>Good to bad, bad to good</li>
</ul>

<p>In Solomon's poem, here are how the good and bad times of the seven quartets are arranged:</p>

<ol>
<li>Good, bad, good, bad</li>
<li>Bad, good, bad, good</li>
<li>Bad, good, bad, good</li>
<li>Bad, good, good, bad</li>
<li>Good, bad, good, bad</li>
<li>Bad, good, bad, good</li>
<li>Good, bad, bad, good</li>
</ol>

<p>Hannah uses parallelism in three of her reversals, the fourth, fifth and seventh.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fourth: Bad, good, bad, good. <em>The Lord kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.</em></li>
<li>Fifth: Bad, good, bad, good. <em>The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts.</em></li>
<li>Seventh: Good, bad, bad, good. <em>“... guard ... his faithful ones, ... wicked ... cut off in darkness, adversaries ... broken to pieces; ... exalt ... his anointed.”</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The fifth and seventh reversals in Hannah's prayer match the schema in Solomon's poem, 
but the fourth has the sense of the third and fourth reversed. Isn't that an inconsistency?</p>

<p>No. The negative and positive connotations found in Solomon's poem are opposite what you find
in history. "A time to scatter stones" sounds negative, but this corresponds to the era when 
the Church overcame Rome, in an event prophesied by Daniel:</p>

<h4>As you looked, a <strong>stone</strong> was cut out by no human hand,</h4>

<h4>and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay,</h4>

<h4>and broke them in pieces.</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 2:34</h6>

<p>Rome was the legs and feet of the statue. Thus the scattering of stones is the shattering of this
empire by God's people into many pieces, a very good time. Conversely, the time to gather stones is the building of the
next beastly empire in God's series, the seventh empire of Revelation, the Islamic Caliphate.</p>

<p>Thus in the three reversals where Hannah uses parallelism, her schema of ordering good and bad events matches the corresponding
quartets of times in Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p><strong>Theme</strong>. When I started adding new historical connections to verses 1-3, my inner critic concocted a another objection.
There did not seem to be any connection to the themes of the prophetic clock, the law, 
childbirth or the growth pattern. The choice of the cited passages from Joshua and Judges 
appeared arbitrary. I merely looked for verses that included matching words or phrases.
Then I stepped back, looked them over again and was delighted. </p>

<ul>
<li>For verse 1, the conquest of Jericho would not have been possible without Rahab, the woman who protected the Israelite spies and became ancestor to David and Jesus.</li>
<li>For verse 2, the glory for the victory over Sisera went to two women, Deborah and Jael. Because of them, it tells us that the wombs of the Israelite women were safe from being violated by their enemies.</li>
<li>For verse 3, Jephthah the Judge makes a foolish oath that costs him his daughter. The courage, sacrifice and dignity belong to a girl whose name we never learn.</li>
<li>For verse 4, the love of a Jewish slave girl for her enemy restored the health of a leprous Syrian general.</li>
<li>For verse 5a, the bravery and tact of Queen Esther saved the Jews.</li>
<li>For verse 5b, two women, barren Elizabeth and virgin Mary, give birth miraculously to prophets, just as Hannah did.</li>
<li>For verse 8a, many notable Christian queens regnant arose to <em>"sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor."</em> They ruled Portugal, Spain, England, Austria and Russia.</li>
<li>For verse 8b, women participated extensively in the Church's missionary enterprise. The first American woman was ordained as a minister during this era: Antoinette Brown Blackwell. Thus women began to take their places as pillars - leaders - in the church.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Voice for Women</h2>

<p>Hannah spoke for those without a voice, for all women who have suffered in silence throughout history.</p>

<p>The words of Jephthah's daughter are poignant:</p>

<h4>So she said to her father,</h4>

<h5>“Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months,</h5>

<h5>that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity,</h5>

<h5>I and my companions.”</h5>

<h4>So he said, “Go.” Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed,</h4>

<h4>she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains.</h4>

<h4>And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her</h4>

<h4>according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man,</h4>

<h4>and it became a custom in Israel that the daughters of Israel</h4>

<h4>went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite</h4>

<h4>four days in the year.</h4>

<p>Jephthah's daughter never married, never had children, never raised a family.
Her womb was barren. By this reference to that foolish vow, Hannah joins
with the other daughters of Israel in remembering a brave and faithful girl.</p>

<p>Taken together, these references to Israel's past and future celebrate the courage, 
faith, humility and dignity of its noblest women. 
Truly Hannah was a prophetess in service of Lady Wisdom.</p>

<h2>Wiser than Hannah?</h2>

<p>Is there a woman in the Bible who was wiser than Hannah? </p>

<p>By direct Biblical statements, no. By logic and inference, maybe. To investigate this question, 
we need to know the sources of wisdom. Then we can compare those sources to the life stories of people
to see who both had access to superior sources of wisdom and availed themselves of that wisdom.
If we assume that all wisdom comes from God, that means all human wisdom arises via communication
between humans and God, whether directly or through intermediaries, like wise parents, the written Word, or angels.</p>

<p>In <em>Job Rises</em>, I catalogued over a dozen ways that people can legitimately communicate with God that Job 
either personally practiced or was aware of. To those we may add being taught in person by the incarnate Jesus,
which Job could not experience but which the Apostles could and did. Of these many means of communication,
some are more associated with wisdom than others. Here are the principal means associated with some Biblical figures.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Job, it was words about God taught to him by his parents and wise elders, things learned from his suffering and theophany (hearing God speak directly).</li>
<li>For Hannah, it was prayer, suffering and sacrifice, for she sacrificed her firstborn son, Samuel.</li>
<li>For Solomon, it was prayer (for God directly granted him wisdom after he prayed for it), dreams (for that prayer was uttered while in a dream), and sacrifice.</li>
<li>For Daniel, it was suffering, as he endured the lion's den, dreams, careful study of the words of the prophets, and angelic visitation.</li>
<li>For the Apostles, is was being taught directly by Jesus, but also visions, such as the ones seen by Peter (concerning Cornelius), John (which gave us Revelation) and Paul (on the Damascus road).</li>
</ul>

<p>One feature that all these people had in common was respect for godly parents or elders. Solomon was raised by David. 
Jewish tradition holds that David used his acrostic poems, like Psalm 119, to teach Solomon his ABC's. 
The Book of Proverbs is structured as a father's advice to his son, but also has a chapter with a mother's advice to 
her son, King Lemuel. Likewise, Daniel would not have acted as he did in the land of captivity had not his parents taught 
him the Law and Jewish customs.</p>

<p>The importance of enduring suffering was illustrated by Job and affirmed by Solomon:</p>

<h4>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,</h4>

<h4>but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</h4>

<h4>- Ecclesiastes 7:4</h4>

<p>From these exemplars, is seems that the most important sources of wisdom are:</p>

<ul>
<li>direct, new revelations from God (angelic visitation, theophany, or walking with Jesus)</li>
<li>suffering and voluntary sacrifice</li>
<li>prayer</li>
<li>careful attention to God's previous revelations (the Bible)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is difficult to order them from most to least important. The greater, more information rich sources are generally 
only open to those who endure suffering and make great sacrifices. Solomon's example is peculiar. 
His wisdom sprang from respecting his father, King David, and offering a great sacrifice (at the temple dedication), 
but not his own suffering. His wisdom depended more upon God's grace than anything else. Thus I would
say that God's unilateral, unconditional grace is the first and greatest source of wisdom.</p>

<p>With these criteria in hand, we can make a determination. Who was counseled by prophets? 
Who spoke with angels? Who walked with Jesus? Who endured great suffering, was persecuted by kings, 
forced into exile, and endured the scorn of neighbors? Who mourned a loss greater than any other person in history 
besides Jesus? Who "found favor with God"?</p>

<p>The Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<h4>And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,</h4>

<h5>“Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising</h5>

<h5>of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed</h5>

<h5>(<strong>and a sword will pierce through your own soul also</strong>),</h5>

<h5>so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.”</h5>

<h6>- Luke 2:34-35</h6>

<p>The sword that pierced Mary was watching her Son be executed on the cross,
seeing the spear pierce his side and his blood pour upon the dirt.
In Jesus are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
As the infinitely holy God and savior of mankind, Jesus is the most precious 
man in the universe. No other mother in all of history ever lost a child of infinite value.</p>

<ul>
<li>If suffering produces wisdom in the faithful, no other woman could ever receive as much wisdom from that source as Mary did.</li>
<li>If obedience produces wisdom, no other woman was ever called upon to obey such a strange command as to bear a child for God.</li>
<li>If accepting the words of the prophets produces wisdom, they warned her about what would come and she remained steadfast.</li>
<li>If heeding the advice of angels produces wisdom, she (and Joseph) listened and went into exile, then returned, like Abraham who left his country for God.</li>
<li>If walking with Jesus and hearing his teachings produces wisdom, Mary was there not for three years but for his whole earthly life.</li>
<li>If God's unmerited grace produces wisdom, then we have this:</li>
</ul>

<h4>“My soul magnifies the Lord,</h4>

<h5>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</h5>

<h6>for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.</h6>

<h4>For behold, from now on <strong>all generations will call me blessed</strong>;</h4>

<h5>for he who is mighty has done great things for me,</h5>

<h6>and holy is his name.</h6>

<h6>- Luke 1:46-49</h6>

<p>Hannah offered her son to serve in the temple, but Mary was called upon to make a much greater sacrifice.</p>

<p>Hannah prophesied the coming of the messiah, but Mary gave him life, nursed him, taught him, protected him and told him when 
it was time for his ministry to begin.</p>

<p>You may decide whom you think was the wisest woman ever to live, but I think the answer is clear. 
What do you thing? Can we get the Guinness Book people to rule on it?</p>
