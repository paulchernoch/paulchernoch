        <h1>The Childbearing</h1>
        <h2>1 Timothy 2</h2>
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-05-19</p>
        
        <h2>Lost in Translation?</h2>

<p>The riddle of "The Childbearing" is one of the principal emotional riddles in the Bible. 1 Timothy 2:15 is wedged in among verses
reviled by feminists. It causes conniptions among egalitarians. The variety of translations alone adds to the camouflage that disguises the true meaning.
Let's start there. Here are <em>some</em> English translations of this passage; most of the ones I omitted are paraphrases, useful for seeing the full range of meaning, but less useful for scholarly study. I have sorted them such that the first few translations are ones that I personally favor for regular Bible study or prefer for their translation of this particular verse.</p>

</ul>

<p>From the variety of renderings, it is clear that the translators are not sure who is being born. That is the riddle.</p>

<h2>Which Child is being Born?</h2>

<p>The translations offer three possible identities for the child being born:</p>

<ul>
<li>The AMPC, GW, EXB, ISV and NOG suggest the possibility (without certainty) that the childbirth responsible for the saving of women was the birth of Jesus, the "Divine Child".</li>
<li>Most translations associate the event with the natural process of childbirth, with each woman being saved from the effects of her own individual pregnancy.</li>
<li>A few translations refuse to define the precise meaning and therefore speak of it as "The Childbearing", "the Childbearing", or "the child-bearing".</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem in many translations is that of number agreement. We have the woman or women giving birth, the child or children being born, the woman or women being saved, and the woman or women who act in faith, love and holiness. Some translations construe all four to be singular. 
"A woman" has "a child", then "she" is saved, because "she" acts in faith, etc. Some construe all to be plural, with multiple women collectively bearing multiple children, from which "they" are saved, because "they" continue in faith. The problem is that the Greek has both singular and plural 
references to women. A singular "she" is being saved, the birth has a definite article so is "the child-bearing", and it is "they" who are
continuing in faith love and holiness. Only the DLNT and YLT (Young's Literal Translation) capture this subtlety.</p>

<p>The letter is being addressed by Paul to a collective group of women - the women of the early church - who are to act in holiness. 
Their great sacrifice will enable a future woman or women to benefit. Since the beneficiaries live in the future and the life of holiness was 
ongoing among Paul's hearers, "The Childbearing" must still remain in their future. That means that "The Childbearing" cannot be the birth of Christ!</p>

<p>There is only one savior, yet this verse speaks of an important child, a singular child who can bring great blessing to all the women 
who would come afterward. No person who is not Jesus can accomplish that, therefore the child to be born is a metaphorical child, not 
a literal child.</p>

<p>On the flip-side, literal death during childbirth was a terrifying reality to women for most of history, up until the middle of the last century. 
During American Colonial times, one woman in eight would die from childbirth. If this verse promises literal deliverance from the misery and death 
that attend childbirth, we must not take that hope away!</p>

<p>The answer to this riddle is that a supernatural birth occurred which brought literal medical salvation to women everywhere.
The easing of women's pains in childbirth is the divine miracle and sign that God gave us to announce this birth! The answer to the riddle
is this:</p>

<p><strong>The Childbearing</strong> is the Protestant Reformation. The child is a new church and a new civilization. That civilization has steadily brought
equality and justice to women. To proclaim this event, God gave us two signs, one symbolic and one literal. The first sign 
told us when the beginning of the rescue of women from oppression had begun. The second sign told us when that rescue would reach a mature stage, not
complete but well advanced.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first, symbolic sign, was the Protestant Reformation itself and the greater freedom that it allowed women to enjoy.</li>
<li>The second, literal sign, was the development of antibiotics and safe blood transfusions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Symbolic sign</strong>. According to Solomon's Clock, the Reformation was "a time to tear", the time of the Childbearing. The tearing was the
birth of a new civilization. Just as a baby being torn from its mother's womb is traumatic, so was the tearing of the Christian church into pieces.
After the birth of a new child, a mother's body needs to mend. This period matches Solomon's "a time to mend".
If the literal danger to women is post partum bleeding, what is the symbolic analog?
The symbolic bleeding was the hemmhoraging of lives from the wars of religion that followed the Reformation, like the Thirty Years War.
The miraculous sign was that the Protestant church survived, due in large part to the sacrifices made by women. 
The Peace of Westphalia and progress toward religious freedom was the evidence of the mending of war-torn Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Literal sign.</strong> From the discovery of blood circulation by William Harvey in 1628 AD to the discovery of Rh typing and 
long term blood storage in 1940 AD, this whole era of over three hundred years saw slow progress toward the ability to offer 
safe blood transfusions. The first attempt to treat post partum hemorrhaging via a transfusion was by James Blundell in 1818. 
Once this procedure was perfected and combined with the invention of antibiotics in 1928, the rate of women dying from childbirth dropped FIFTYFOLD! 
So if 1 Timothy 2 was a prophecy that God would one day save women from the terrible suffering of childbirth, there is only one time 
in history that could possibly fit the bill: the period from 1928 to 1945 when this revolution in medicine occurred.</p>

<p>So when Paul the apostle told women that God would save them through "the Childbearing", he meant it.

It shows that Paul not only told us that God would remedy this medical problem, but told us when.</p>

<p>This passage from 1 Timothy is also analyzed extensively in:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Appendix I: A Clock for Timothy" from <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.</li>
<li>"Epilogue: The Fifth Commandment" from <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>.</li>
