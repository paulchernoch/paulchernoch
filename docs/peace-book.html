<h2><a id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>

<p>Do you lack power and purpose? Do you still need
to be persuaded that God’s Word is both divine
and holds the answers you need? Have you strayed
from the path to peace? This book presents a simple
progression to get you on track:</p>

<p>Pillars. Patterns. Prophecies. Peace.</p>

<p><strong>Pillars</strong>. Proverbs 9 says that wisdom has built her house,
she has hewn its seven pillars. Pillars supply the power to
hold up a house. The Bible has seven pillars and by
meditating on them, those pillars will be replicated within
you, making your life strong. Those seven pillars are
Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew
and Revelation. This book tackles all seven and shows how
they share a unified structure: all seven conform to two
special patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Patterns</strong>. Like a garden, a peaceful life must be sown
with good seed and cultivated diligently if a plentiful
harvest is to be reaped. This book explores <em>tactics</em> and
<em>strategies</em> God revealed to us to accomplish such a feat.
They are drawn from the Book of Ecclesiastes, the parables
of Jesus and elsewhere in Bible. The <em>tactics</em> revolve around
a <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">harvest pattern</a> of seven steps which can be applied to
individual challenges throughout life. The <em>strategy</em> is built
upon the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3 which form a
<a href="./growth-pattern.html">growth pattern</a>. Grouped by fours into “seven pieces of
peace”, these times plot an orderly course through life’s
different seasons from birth to maturity, from “a time to be
born” to “a time for peace”. By these patterns you can
discover God’s changing purposes for you in every season
of life. You can also see God’s sovereign plan for all of
history.</p>

<p><strong>Prophecies</strong>. Do these ancient principles and practices
still work? That is where Solomon’s wisdom shines. God
has shaped all of human history to conform to these same
patterns. When you see hundreds of prophecies unfolding
in the pages of history you can be certain that God’s plans
for an eternal harvest have not been derailed. You will be
persuaded that God’s Word is true, miraculous, and
expertly crafted to guide you onto the path to…</p>

<p><strong>Peace</strong>. If the Lord can keep an uncooperative world on
track, He can establish you and guide you to your own time
for peace, with Lady Wisdom as your guide.</p>

<h4>Her ways are ways of pleasantness,</h4>

<h5>and all her paths are peace.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 3:17, ESV</h6>

<h2><a id="Peace-in-our-Time">Peace in our Time</a></h2>

<p>While the world worried how long we’d have to
practice “social-distancing”, while it was
anxious how many more would die of the novel
Coronavirus, and from where their next paycheck would
come, I was dreaming. Tucked in between Good Friday and
Easter Sunday, it was an early Saturday morning in April,
2020. I was all set to do something. (I don’t know what, but
dreaming me was looking forward to it.) Then my dream
wife (whose habits and timing are uncannily like the real
thing) stopped me with that “First I have something I need
you to do” look. “It’s flower day,” I said with resignation.
That would mean trips to Mahoney’s Garden Center for
flowers, Lowe’s or Spartan Hardware for mulch and
manure, quality time with a hoe, shovel and wheelbarrow,
reattaching hoses, and... you get the picture.</p>

<p>Then I awoke. It wasn’t flower day! Still too cold. Worried
for nothing. I still had raking and leaf blowing to do. When I
pushed a wheelbarrow of yard waste behind the shed, a
pile of acorns and grass clippings I dumped last fall caught
my eye. Amid the decaying matter rose a single grape
hyacinth in full bloom. The pic I snapped of it graces the
cover of this book.</p>

<p>Months before I began worrying about spring chores,
God had already arranged for this plant to sprout, grow,
and blossom. Twenty feet away was a second hyacinth! For
over twenty autumns I have dumped flower pots, grass,
leaves and acorns in that spot, and I never remember
anything so pretty coming up the next spring.</p>

<p>That got me thinking. Who else used to tell a story about
flowers and worrying? Jesus.</p>

<h4>“So why do you worry about clothing? Consider</h4>

<h4>the lilies of the field, how they grow: they</h4>

<h4>neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that</h4>

<h4>even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed</h4>

<h4>like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass</h4>

<h4>of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is</h4>

<h4>thrown into the oven, will He not much more</h4>

<h4>clothe you, O you of little faith?”</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 6:28-30, NKJV</h6>

<p>Jesus told people not to worry about clothing and used
flowers to make his point, and here I was worrying about
the flowers themselves! Jesus contrasted Solomon, whose
wealth could get him anything he wanted, with a simple
lily, prettier than a king. That would be the king who said in
Ecclesiastes 10:19 that “money is the answer for everything”.
Is it? Solomon was being ironic. It never occurred to me
why Jesus contrasted Solomon with lilies until after I looked
long and hard at one of the three books attributed to
Solomon. What is the point of Ecclesiastes?</p>

<p><strong>Peace</strong>. Ecclesiastes is about the long journey through
life’s trials in search of peace, the final rest of a contented
soul at the end of a meaningful and productive life that
achieved great things lasting ‘til eternity, earned the respect
of the community, the praise of God and won’t be forgotten
by future generations.</p>

<p>Who is our guide for that journey? The wisest man
(besides Jesus) who ever lived: King Solomon of Israel. Our
guide — did he ever find that kind of peace? Solomon took
too many wives, departed from a pure faith when he built
altars to his wives’ false gods, and raised an unworthy heir.
To top it off, God told him that for all his sins, the kingdom
would be torn from the hands of his descendants. Would
building the Kingdom of Israel into a world power, his
greatest accomplishment, come to nothing? Solomon saw
death’s approach and God’s sentence as an irremediable
state of affairs. He was a man profoundly troubled. He was
a man whose energetic quest for peace had failed.</p>

<p>Why should we trust a failure like King Solomon to guide
us toward a life of peace? For the same reason we should
trust Job, a persecuted man who accused God of treating
him unjustly, to explain the love of God. For the same
reason we should trust Habakkuk, a prophet who saw only
enemy invasions, crop failures and ruin, to teach us the
path to joy. And for the same reason we should trust Moses,
a humble herdsman with just enough to feed his family, to
set millions free and provide food and water to last a
generation of wandering in the desert.</p>

<p>We should choose to trust the words they wrote because
God, paradoxically, chose them to be our teachers. This
book will demonstrate that Ecclesiastes is far more than a
meandering collection of wise aphorisms, cautionary tales,
and nihilistic jabs at materialistic hedonism. Instead,
Ecclesiastes presents a systematic framework for looking at
life. It identifies seven pieces that must be assembled in
harmony so a peaceful life may be realized.</p>

<p>And then it blows your mind! The Teacher (as the writer
of Ecclesiastes called himself ) who saw only ruin for his
kingdom’s future was unaware of what he had
accomplished. His words prophesy how those same
principles of peace would be used by God to guide the
entire course of human events, from the days in which he
lived until the end of the world. From the fate of one
person to the destiny of empires, God’s sovereignty is
supreme. Once you see the pattern unfold throughout the
pages of history, you will trust these principles to work for
you.</p>

<p><strong>Once you follow these principles yourself, you can know a peace like Solomon never knew.</strong></p>

<h2>What this book is not!</h2>

<p>This book is not a Bible study or commentary. It will not
in linear fashion derive insights from every verse.
Ecclesiastes addresses many topics besides peace, but only
such as pertain to our focus will be analyzed.</p>

<p>While this book is not a counseling manual, it will make
the meaning clear enough to foster interior transformation.
The Holy Spirit is the best counselor. After a person has
comprehended and accepted part of God’s Word, the Spirit
refines and deepens understanding, then applies it to their
heart to promote healing and holiness and supply
direction. Human counselors are not without merit. To the
extent that this book shines a mirror on areas of personal
weakness, it can enrich the conversations you are already
having with your trusted advisors.</p>

<p>Over the years, special people have helped me find my
way. We didn’t keep long prayer vigils. They didn’t listen to
hours of me reciting my complaints and interject
miraculous counsel. No, they gave me God’s words, not
their own. They pointed me to a better Counselor than they
could ever be. Words they introduced me to changed me.
This book proposes to add my testimony of the efficacy of
these words to stimulate you to study them carefully, with
the result that you, too, enjoy <em>“the peace of God which
surpasses all understanding”</em> (Philippians 4:7).</p>

<h2>Show time!</h2>

<p>If Solomon accomplished one thing in his writing, it was
to <strong>show time</strong> in all its facets. Time is the ground on which
faith rests. We want something now, but God promises it
tomorrow. If we trust Him, we are at peace. If we doubt
Him, we are consumed by anxiety.</p>

<p>Let’s begin our time together with a schedule of events.
In Ecclesiastes 3, Solomon begins by saying, 
<em>“there is a <strong>time</strong> to every <strong>purpose</strong> under <strong>heaven</strong>”</em> and concludes with 
<em>“a time for <strong>peace”</em></strong>. In blazing a path to peace, this book will focus
on three critical topics: <em>purpose</em>, <em>time</em> and <em>heaven</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 2 to 11</strong> tussle with five paradoxes: love, joy,
peace, purpose and goodness. The path to each must
involve a paradox, because if it came naturally, all
people would presently be at peace. Our look at
purpose will be detailed. It will occupy eight of those
ten chapters, beginning with “Purpose and Peace”, and
examine eleven purposes for life that Solomon tried
and rejected as futile. Finding the right path begins
with eliminating the wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12</strong>, “There is a season”, offers a first look in
Solomon’s mirror: chapter 3 of Ecclesiastes. It’s broken
in seven pieces, but instead of bringing seven years’
bad luck, it will help diagnose seven problem areas in
life, to find what is stealing our peace.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 13</strong>, “Qualifying Time”, shows a glimpse of my
disqualifications. After you come face-to-face with the
anxious, gullible, aimless fool I was in my youth and
how the Lord straightened me out, you will know why I
wrote this book and why its message is valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 14</strong>, “To Number our Days”, catalogs the
symbolic meaning of numbers that appear frequently in
the Bible. By understanding these numbers, we can
spot clues to the patterns God has woven into history.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 15</strong>, “Days of Darkness”, is a meditation on
seven pieces of peace derived from Ecclesiastes 3 to
help prepare for the days of darkness warned about by
Solomon.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 16</strong>, “Twelve Timely Questions”, steps back to
ask this poser: What are the twelve most important
questions a person has to answer in life? We address
nine primary questions, plus three that get in the way.
Surely peace stands out of reach for those who lack
their answers. How much farther is it removed from
those who lack even the questions? We shall drill down
into the questions to discover a dozen spiritual
treasures worth searching your whole life for, treasures
“that can never perish, spoil or fade” (1 Peter 1:4).</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 17</strong> means it’s “Hammer Time”! Solomon said,
“the words of scholars are like well-driven nails”
(Ecclesiastes 12:11). Some lessons must be painful, if
their point is to be driven home.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 18 and 19</strong>, “Hour of Temptation” and “Three
Appointments with Satan”, peek at Satan’s
appointment calendar. The father of lies has
impeccable timing. The enemy always knows when God
is up to something special, and tries to derail God’s
plans. We will listen in on all three conversations with
Satan recorded in the Bible: in Genesis, Job and
Matthew. If Satan tries to destroy something, you can
bet it’s important.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 20</strong>, “Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1”, starts
ticking off seven clocks, prophetic instruments built
into Scripture. Satan’s clock we already covered. Four
more are announced in Ecclesiastes 1: Generational,
Spiritual, Celestial, and Empire. A sixth is implied: the
Harvest clock. The seventh, the Lifetime clock, I found
in Job while researching my previous book, Job Rises. [1]
These clocks sometimes foretell specific future events,
but more often foretell the character of future ages.
Seeing the shape of the times in which you live
recorded in the Bible changes you.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 21</strong>, “The Final Countdown”, tinkers with
Satan’s countdown clock to improve its accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 22</strong>, “Four Months till Harvest”, discloses that
one of the seven clocks, the Harvest clock, applies to
nations and individuals. It measures spiritual growth
and governs the character of each battle in the spiritual
wars fought throughout life. Attune yourself to this
clock and you will understand your obstacles and foes,
as well as your assets and allies.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 23 to 37</strong>, from “Winding the Clock” to “Father
Time: Job 38-42”, derive insights from Revelation,
Ecclesiastes, Psalm 119 and Job. They examine the inner
workings of all seven types of clock, one at a time.
These clocks reinforce a single message. Two are widely
discussed in other books on eschatology (the Spiritual
and Empire clocks), so will be summarized. The
Generational and Celestial clocks may be original
discoveries, so extra care is devoted to explaining and
justifying them.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 38 and 39</strong>, “Generations come and go” and
“Two Patterns in History”, ponder a shocking idea: God
may have sovereignly mirrored history using symmetric
parallelism. If He engineered some sort of “cosmic
chiasm”, does that narrow down when the Lord will
return?</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 40</strong>, “Swords, Seals &amp; Surviving to Saturday”,
scrutinizes the symbolic use of swords throughout the
Bible and ties it to the seven seals on the scroll in
Revelation.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 41 to 44</strong>, concluding with “The Confinement
Calendar”, ponder social upheavals God has employed
to liberate the world, with a focus on women.
Chapter 45, “A Grand Father Clock &amp; a Silver Cord”,
discovers another clock hidden in Ecclesiastes which
chronicles the work of the Father from creation to the
second coming.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 46 to 53</strong>, beginning with “Solving the
Historical Psalms”, dissect the seven historical psalms
(Psalms 78, 105, 106, 107, 114, 135 &amp; 136) in which we can
discern a series of interlocking clocks that disclose
patterns in how the Holy Spirit has worked throughout
history.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters 54 and 55</strong>, “A Minute Look at Matthew” and
“One Greater than Solomon”, find that in the Gospel of
Matthew, God outlined his plan for five major waves of
Christian missionary expansion, all of which have come
to fruition when, where and how He said they would.
Furthermore, they find that the twenty-eight chapters
of Matthew are intentionally structured according to
the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3. Matthew
reveals Jesus as the new and greater Solomon. Lastly,
just as the early chapters showed from Ecclesiastes the
futility of all human life purposes, this chapter shows
from Matthew the eternal utility of God’s purposes. He
graciously invites us to join us in His work, which leads
to an everlasting harvest of eternal treasures.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 56</strong>, “Peace in His Time”, returns to Solomon.
Why did he never find peace? Does his own book reflect
his distorted priorities? Does it reflect ours?</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 57</strong>, “Epilogue: What Time is it?” gathers into
one place what all the clocks in this book have to say
about our current time and the one about to start.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 58</strong>: “Aftertaste: Donner &amp; Blitzen” tackles the
most mysterious chapter in the Bible: Revelation 10.
This is when the Apostle John hears the voices of the
seven thunders speak – and a voice from heaven tells
him not to write it down! What did they say?</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 59</strong>: “The Seven Pillars of Wisdom” answers an
ancient riddle: What are the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
spoken of in Proverbs 9? The answer to this riddle fits
all the wisdom books in the Bible into a single
framework enabling us to see their grand design.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix A: Heavenly Peace”</strong> explains what the
sevenfold harvest pattern and Solomon’s twenty-eight
times tell us about heaven.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix B: Index of Prophetic Clocks”</strong> summarizes
all thirty-four prophetic clocks described in the book.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix C: A Time for Israel”</strong> applies Solomon’s
twenty-eight times to the history of modern Israel, with
reference to Ecclesiastes and Psalm 107.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix D: To Number our Psalms”</strong> analyzes the
prophecies found in Psalms 58, 91, 102, &amp; 127.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix E: The Plan of Proverbs”</strong> shows how the
book of Proverbs is patterned after the twenty-eight
times listed in Ecclesiastes 3 and prophesies dozens of
events from Solomon’s time until the Lord returns.
(Note: The First Edition of this book suffered a
publication error that deleted seventeen pages of this
appendix, restored in the Second Edition.)</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix F: Job Keeps Perfect Time”</strong> shows where
Solomon’s twenty-eight times appear in Job. Took three
years studying Job to notice them. Boy, was I surprised!</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix G: A Prophetic Song of Songs”</strong> shows how
the Song of Solomon also is patterned after the twenty-
eight times of Ecclesiastes 3, prophetically.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix H: Clues to Wisdom’s Pillars”</strong> shows
additional connections between the seven Bible books
that constitute the seven pillars. It provides additional
support for conclusions made in chapter 59, “The
Seven Pillars of Wisdom”. It shows from Scripture that
God set aside this current era as the time when He
would unseal the identities of the Seven Pillars of
Wisdom.</p>

<p><strong>“Appendix I: A Clock for Timothy”</strong> decodes a prophetic
clock hidden in 1 &amp; 2 Timothy that connects those
books to Solomon’s Growth Pattern, the Ten
Commandments and prophecies in other letters of Paul.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>No book can give a comprehensive view of peace, even
one as long as this. This book goes into specifics in a few
areas of life, but for the rest proposes general principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Tactics</em>. To master an individual life struggle requires sound tactics. This book derives from Scripture a sevenfold harvest pattern which you can apply repeatedly throughout your days as you seek to lead a productive and fulfilling life.</li>
<li><em>Strategy</em>. Growing from infancy to maturity, we pass through seven stages of life, each recognized and examined by Solomon in Ecclesiastes. In each stage, a person faces a different mix of challenges. We need tools for them all.</li>
<li><em>Goals</em>. Our strategies and tactics must serve the pursuit of a noble, long term purpose. Ecclesiastes speaks extensively about the meaning and purpose of life – and all the false and destructive substitutes that confuse and beguile us.</li>
<li><em>Stability</em>. Our world appears out of control. You will not find peace trying to control it and assert your own sovereignty over it. You will find peace by recognizing the guiding and protecting hand of God in history. The same tactics, strategy and goals that we wrestle with in our short lives God has projected upon all of history. He employs them to rule the nations. He produces harvests and raises whole civilizations up from infancy to maturity, even His church. The proof of this in found in fulfilled prophecy. God keeps His promises.</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest caveat is that the ideas and prophecies
examined in this book can in nowise be used to predict the
day, the month, the year or even the century in which the
Lord will return. Approximate dates for the boundaries of
key time periods have been used to obfuscate the likeliest
time of the second coming. This is to respect this solemn
truth:</p>

<h4>“But about that day or hour no one knows,</h4>

<h4>not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,</h4>

<h4>but only the Father.</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 24:36, NIV</h6>

<p>Where dating of ancient events enters the discussion,
Bishop Ussher’s chronology is used (with adjustments as
noted, equaling sixteen years at most), though modern
scholarship, even among conservative theologians, has
uncovered evidence that requires some events to be shifted
a decade here or there. With competing chronologies to
choose from, it would be easy to select the one that bet fits
the schema of history contained in this book. No attempt to
“chronology shop” has been done, even though the
division of history resulting from Ussher’s work sometimes
runs counter to the author’s expectations.</p>

<p>Truly, how accurate a date for the Lord’s return would a
person need to justify changing their behavior? Within a
day? Certainly. A year? Yes, again. A decade? Likely. A
century? At a century, we might change how we raise our
kids. How about a hundred twenty years? In the time of
Noah, God issued a decree.</p>

<h4>Then the LORD said,</h4>

<h5>“My Spirit will not contend with humans forever,</h5>

<h5>for they are mortal; their days will be</h5>

<h5>a hundred and twenty years.”</h5>

<h6>- Genesis 6:3, NIV</h6>

<p>Christians argue about what this means, but for a very
long time, no one (with indisputable documentation) has
lived longer than 120 years. So if Jesus was set to return in
120 years or ten thousand years, it would make no
difference to anyone now alive. They would be dead.</p>

<p>With this proviso I feel comfortable setting forth my
ideas, constructed with care, to guide and encourage but
not infringe on impermissible territory that is the
prerogative of God the Father. I swear that my timetable
can’t be used to narrow down the timing of the Lord’s
return to an accuracy of better than 120 years.</p>

<p>Why make such a promise? I am not the first to tread
lightly in this area. The great physicist Isaac Newton faced a
problem in his day. Ignorant or exploitive people troubled
the church with impending apocalypse. The scholar
devoted fifty years study to history, chronology, and
Biblical prophecy. His motive was to allay people’s anxieties
that they not live in perpetual fear. His calculations derived
a range of dates for the Lord’s return. Strangely, he did all
the math but refused to write the final sum, even in private
notes. In person he calmed people’s fears, but never
published his speculations. The earliest date he envisioned
was 2060, the latest, 2300 AD. Notice, the range he arrived
at is 2180 ± 120 years. Newton couched his answer using the
same error bars as I have chosen! (Hint: The range of dates
during which I believe it most likely that the Lord will
return overlaps Newton’s.)</p>

<p>Coincidence? I selected my error bars according to
Scripture, not our esteemed scientist. However, why be
concerned what a man said three hundred years ago? Was
Newton a prophet? An apostle? No, but he made other
predictions that should give us pause. At a time of great
anti-semitism, when no people in Christendom believed
God would permit the Jewish people to recover their lands
and reestablish their nation, Newton believed otherwise.
He predicted that in the 1890’s, the Jews would gather and
plan how to reclaim and rebuild their nation. What
happened then? The First Zionist Congress was held in
Switzerland in 1897. Newton also predicted that in 1944, the
Jewish people would found a new nation of Israel. The good
physicist was close. It happened in 1948.</p>

<p>Doesn’t positing <em>any</em> pattern, however fuzzy, risk
panicking credulous people – or conversely make them
complacent? No, because I affirm the reason that governs
the timing of the Day of the Lord: God’s mercy.</p>

<h4>“If those days had not been cut short, no one</h4>

<h4>would survive, but for the sake of the elect</h4>

<h4>those days will be shortened.</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 24:22, NIV</h6>

<p>No matter what pattern is evident in history, that pattern
reveals God’s sovereignty and reassures His people that His
plan is still being obeyed <em>but it does not predict Christ’s return</em>. 
God is free. He will freely abandon His careful plan
and come to rescue those He loves just as soon as He
decides that “enough is enough”. God’s regular plan is the
foundation of our peace. Christ’s irregular return is the love
that lifts us high atop the towers of the city built upon that
foundation.</p>

<p>At the outset of World War II, Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain returned to England boasting of his success
negotiating the Munich accord with Herr Hitler:</p>

<h4>My good friends, for the second time in our</h4>

<h4>history, a British Prime Minister has returned</h4>

<h4>from Germany bringing peace with honour. I</h4>

<h4>believe it is peace for our time. We thank</h4>

<h4>you from the bottom of our hearts. Go home</h4>

<h4>and get a nice quiet sleep.</h4>

<h6>- PM Neville Chamberlain</h6>

<p>That peace agreement started the most terrible war yet
fought on this planet. Chamberlain’s mistake is our
mistake. We think peace is the result of our plans, our
activity, our agreements. It is not. We must act in concert
with God’s plan. We must live in God’s time and find peace
on God’s schedule.</p>

<p>Now let’s build that peace!</p>
