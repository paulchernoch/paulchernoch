          <h1>Two Patterns in History</h1>
          <h2>The Cosmic Chiasm</h2>
          <p class="wordcount">7874 words long.</p>
          <p class="date">Published on 2024-06-17</p>
          
          <p><img class="center" src="images/earth-in-mirror.png" /></p>

<p>In the Odyssey, Homer tells the adventure of a man
trying to get home after fighting a war. We are all
Odysseus. We are all trying to get home. Jesus
promised to his friends that in his father’s house there are
many mansions. How do we get there? One generation at a
time...</p>

<h2>Temples, Built and Broken</h2>

<h3>1st &amp; 42nd generations.</h3>

<p>In the beginning, Adam and
Eve are exiled from Eden. All of human history is our
journey back to Eden. In the last and matching generation,
Christ will return. He said that in his father’s house there
are many mansions. He will take his faithful there.</p>

<h3>7th &amp; 35th generations.</h3>

<p>In 1883 BC, at the start of the
7th generation:</p>

<h4>“... God said,</h4>

<h5>‘Take your son, your only son,</h5>

<h5>whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah.</h5>

<h5>Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering</h5>

<h5>on a mountain I will show you.’”</h5>

<h6>- Genesis 22:2, NIV</h6>

<p>Abraham proved his faithfulness by preparing to do that, before God stayed his
hand and provided a ram.
A century later, around 1773 BC, Jacob, son of Isaac, fled
from his home, fearing his brother Esau’s wrath. Before he
made it to Laban’s house, he fell asleep on Mount Moriah.
There he witnessed angels ascending and descending a
ladder. He named the place Bethel, meaning house of the
Lord. About eight hundred years later, Solomon would
build the Temple in Jerusalem on that spot where first
Abraham and Isaac and later Jacob met with God.</p>

<p>In the matching generation, the Ottoman Turks captured
Jerusalem in 1517 AD. In a twist, the Muslims permitted
Greek Christians to rebuild churches and monasteries in
Jerusalem, and Jews to rebuild synagogues.</p>

<p>Earlier in that generation, in 1453 AD, the Ottomans
captured Constantinople, at that time the heart of
Christendom. The greatest church in the Eastern Roman
Empire, Haggia Sophia, was converted into a mosque.</p>

<h3>14th &amp; 28th generations.</h3>

<p>In about 1010 BC, King David
captured Jebus and renamed it Jerusalem. His son Solomon
built the temple there.</p>

<p>In the matching generation, during the Byzantine-
Sassanian War, the Jews recaptured Jerusalem for the last
time before regaining statehood in 1948. They lost it again,
and then the Muslims captured Jerusalem in 637 AD. In 692
AD, they built the Dome of the Rock on the old temple
mount. This prompted Bishop Sophronius to blurt out,
<em>“The abomination that causes desolation!”</em></p>

<h3>21st generation.</h3>

<p>As already discussed, this generation
saw the temple in Jerusalem desecrated (167 BC), then
cleansed and rededicated. It saw Jerusalem’s walls rebuilt,
breached, and rebuilt again. It saw the Samaritan temple on
Mount Gerazim destroyed, rebuilt and destroyed again.</p>

<p>What is the constant theme? Jerusalem, the temple,
worship and strife. Finding, preparing, protecting and
restoring a place where man can meet with God in safety is
impossible in this world. Worship is precious and the
enemy seeks to stop it. Only when the new Jerusalem
descends from heaven will a permanent house of worship
become a reality.</p>

<p>In addition to exhibiting symmetry related to events
relevant to temple worship, these seven generations also
mark off a harvest clock:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generations 1-6</strong> (4020-1885 BC) were the time of preparation, where many nations and peoples and languages were split off, culminating in the birth of Abraham.</li>
<li><strong>Generations 7-13</strong> (1885-1052 BC) were the time of plowing and suffering. Jacob slaved away for Laban, Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, and the twelve tribes endured slavery in Egypt. Then they wandered in the desert. Even after entering the promised suffered from anarchy during the time of the Judges. Above all, righteous Job suffered at the hand of Satan.</li>
<li><strong>Generations 14-20</strong> (1052-219 BC) were the time when God sowed the seed of His Word. The books of the prophets and the writings were added to the Pentateuch to complete the Old Testament. The first temple was built near the beginning and destroyed near the end of this season.</li>
<li><strong>Generations 21-27</strong> (219 BC-614 AD) were the time of the watering of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit’s first task was to seal up prophecy; the Septuagint was finished and the canon settled. Then the Spirit overshadowed Mary and she conceived Jesus. After Jesus rose from the dead, the Spirit was poured out on the church and it grew.</li>
<li><strong>Generations 28-34</strong> (614-1447 AD) were times of plucking and pruning by the Father. Many trials beset the church, from the First Islamic Jihad, to the Great Schism, through to the Black Plague and the Fall of Constantinople, to teach it not to love power and wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Generations 35-41</strong> (1447-2280 AD) were and are the time of harvest. Beginning with the Protestant Reformation, in many waves of missionary activity and revivals, the Lord has spread the Gospel and salvation all over the world.  </li>
<li><strong>Generation 42</strong> (2280 AD to <em>eternity</em>) will be the time of peace following the bountiful harvest, when we celebrate the Wedding Supper of the Lamb.</li>
</ul>

<p>On to the second story!</p>

<h2>Correlational Caveats</h2>

<p>After much ink, we finally come to the many historical
coincidences that persuaded me that God has a
symmetrical plan for history that is rapidly approaching its
completion. The symmetry is the proof, but what does the
end of the pattern mean? It is essential to stress that while
the end of the pattern may coincide with the return of
Christ, it may merely mean that the church is fully mature
by Solomon’s standard set forth in Ecclesiastes 3. Once
mature, the church will be ready for the glorious task the
Lord intends to commission it to do next. Regardless, it will
be a momentous time in history.</p>

<p>Once I completed the following set of correspondences, I
graded them subjectively. The pressure to succumb to
confirmation bias is enormous. Most correspondences are
strong. A few are weaker. One suffers from matching events
of two consecutive generations (19 matches both 23 &amp; 24),
calling into question the generation boundaries (arguing for
an adjustment of 2-3 years). At this point, the strength of
the points of comparison for most matching pairs of
generations convinces me that where there are weaknesses,
it’s from my ignorance of history and scripture, not the
absence of a match.</p>

<p>The last hole in the pattern that I needed to fill was for
the middle of the time of the Judges, when Ruth lived.
Again and again I returned to that generation and its
opposite and came up empty. Then I prayed and the Lord
opened my eyes. My chronology slotted Gideon the Judge
in the generation after Ruth. I discovered that his early
years fell at the end of Ruth’s generation, including his first
conquest. My heart burned with excitement as I read from
Judges. Had I found the last connection? I slept on it. The
next morning, I watched our church service on Zoom.
During greeting time, I shared with another member about
my excitement reading about Gideon. His response? He
also read Gideon this month! This is just one of the diverse
ways that God has encouraged me to press on and not be
content to make claims about the Bible that I cannot
support. If it is really He who wants me to say it, then He
will help me say it well.</p>

<h2>Turning History Inside Out</h2>

<p>The way the chiasm breaks history down the middle
explains much. On the left is ancient history. From the 1st
to the 19th generation, every chosen historical event is
drawn from the Old Testament. During the 20th and 21st
generations, no new Scripture was written; there were no
more prophets in Israel. However, during this time the
Septuagint was written.</p>

<p>On the right is recent history, church history. All the
events from the 24th to the 39th generation are drawn from
history books, not the Bible. However, for the 22nd and
23rd generations, events are drawn from the New
Testament. Thus one side of every pair of generations has
Bible events, while the other side has events recorded in
secular history, with three exceptions. The 40th to the
42nd generation have yet to be written. For that we have
guesses based on the early chapters of Genesis.</p>

<p>As in Job Rises, we will begin in the middle, when Christ
was born, then work our way to the beginning and end of
history. I will try to contain my excitement, which rises
anew each time I contemplate this marvelous evidence of
the sovereignty of God.</p>

<h3>#21 (219-100 BC) vs. #22 (100 BC-19 AD). <em>Son of God</em>.</h3>

<p>Victories over Carthage in the 2nd and 3rd Punic wars,
plus the defeat of the Seleucid Empire at Thermopylae and
Magnesia ad Sipylum made Rome master of the
Mediterranean. As war reparations bled Antiochus IV
Epiphanes dry, he raised taxes on the Jews, suppressed
their religion and desecrated their temple. The Maccabean
Revolt and the Jews’ subsequent alliance with Rome yielded
a measure of autonomy. Their miraculous Hanukkah lamp
was the faint light that gave them hope, and Rome their
benevolent savior.</p>

<p>Turn the clock to 100 BC and Julius Caesar was born. The
Roman senate granted him divine honors, the first Roman
citizen so honored. By this token, his adopted son Octavian
(Caesar Augustus) acquired the title divi filius, literally “son
of the god”. With Rome now subjugating Judea and
arrogating the role of “Son of God” while a brutal Herod
the Great built a new temple in Jerusalem, the Jews were
illuminated by darkness and oppressed by saviors who
would not save.</p>

<p>Then a star over Bethlehem lit the way to the true Son of
God, king and light of the world. In the 21st generation, the
completion of the Septuagint set God’s Word down on
parchment. In the 22nd, the Word became flesh. The Holy
Spirit that had departed Israel now returned. Where no
prophets had walked for centuries, new voices could be
heard: Elizabeth, Mary, Zechariah, Anna, and Simeon.</p>

<p>I still like eating Caesar Salad, though.</p>

<h3>#20 (338-219 BC) vs. #23 (19-138 AD). God &amp; Savior.</h3>

<p>The 20th generation had its own share of glory hounds.
Alexander the Great claimed the title Son of Zeus, another
variation on “Son of God”. One of his successors, Ptolemy I,
waited until he was dead for his son to have him acclaimed
Theos Soter – God and Savior.</p>

<p>Both men died and stayed dead. Then in the 23rd
generation, the true Son of God and Savior was acclaimed,
not by human sycophants but by God Himself, and not by
empty words but by raising Jesus from the dead.</p>

<h3>#19 (457-338 BC) vs. #24 (138-257 AD). <em>Destruction</em>.</h3>

<p>In the 19th generation, God sent his last prophet for a
long time to Israel. Malachi warned that God would be like
a “refiner’s fire” (Malachi 3:2-4), but if that didn’t work:</p>

<h4>“See, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before</h4>

<h4>that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes.</h4>

<h4>He will turn the hearts of the parents to their children,</h4>

<h4>and the hearts of the children to their parents;</h4>

<h4>or else I will come and strike the land with total</h4>

<h4>destruction.”</h4>

<h6>- Malachi 4:5-6, NIV</h6>

<p>The 19th is that rare generation where the matching
event falls not in the opposite 24th generation, but in the
last few years of the 23rd. The Bar Kokhba Revolt, also
called the Third Jewish-Roman War, was fought from
132-136 AD. Over half a million died in the war. More died of
starvation or were enslaved. The Jewish community in the
land was shattered. Rejecting the true messiah, they
followed a false one to their doom.</p>

<p>Not everyone rejected the refiner’s fire. During the 24th
generation, the church endured much persecution, and
along with the empire endured the Antonine Plague, the
Plague of Cyprian, and the start of the crisis of the third
century. It was not destroyed.</p>

<h3>#18 (576-457 BC) vs. #25 (257-376 AD). <em>Relief</em>.</h3>

<p>During the former generation, Haman instigated a royal
proclamation to persecute the Jews throughout Persia ca
473 BC. At the last minute it was averted, due to the bravery
of Queen Esther and Mordecai. Alerted to the evil nature of
Haman’s plans, the king of Persia authorized the Jews to
defend themselves.</p>

<p>During the latter generation, the Roman Emperor
Valerian issued two edicts authorizing the persecution and
execution of Christians. While fighting in the east, he was
captured at Edessa in 260 AD by the Persians under king
Shapur and held captive for the rest of his life. His son
Gallienus cancelled his father’s decrees and issued Rome’s
first edict of toleration toward Christians. Thus twice did a
Persian king’s actions suspend the persecution of God’s
people.</p>

<p>Gallienus’ benevolence initiated the forty year “Little
Peace of the Church”. Christians grew in numbers. Now
legally permitted to hold positions in society formerly
denied them, believers’ influence in society expanded. This
peace ended under Diocletian, who instigated the Great
Persecution in 303 AD. However this time a different king
intervened. God caused the Emperor Constantine to follow
the way of the cross and after the Edict of Milan in 313 AD,
Roman persecution of Christians ended for good.</p>

<h3>#17 (695-576 BC) vs. #26 (376-495 AD). <em>Lost &amp; Found</em>.</h3>

<p>In the 17th generation, Judah lost something, found it,
and lost something else. Hidden in a temple storeroom,
Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law that had been
lost and took it to King Josiah. Reading it was devastating.
He was changed and he changed the kingdom. This delayed
but did not avert a second loss: their home. The exiles lost
their kingdom in 609 BC, their city, Jerusalem, in 597 BC,
and their temple in 587 BC. Would they also lose their God?</p>

<p>In the 26th generation, the church made sure the Word
of God would not be lost in their day: in 405 AD, Jerome
completed the Vulgate, a translation of the Bible into Latin.
Paradoxically, the church also lost their city. In 410, the
Visigoth Alaric sacked Rome. Then in 476 AD, the barbarian
Odoacer took Rome and the throne, marking the end of the
Western Roman Empire. With a defiant faith, Augustine (ca
420 AD) transcended the chaos and decay of his civilization
and penned City of God. Those who find and keep God’s
Word will never lose their share in the city whose
foundations can never be shaken.</p>

<h3>#16 (814-695 BC) vs. #27 (495-614 AD). <em>Dark &amp; Light</em>.</h3>

<p>In the 16th, Jonah saw darkness gathering. Lusting for
judgment on cruel Assyria, God instead compelled him to
warn Nineveh, and they listened. Assyria escaped God’s
wrath and in turn poured out its wrath upon Israel.</p>

<p>Hezekiah saw the darkness of the grave nearing, and his
tears and pleading did not escape God’s notice. By Isaiah’s
word, the Lord made the shadows go back ten steps on the
stair (2 Kings 20, Isaiah 38) and added fifteen years of light
to Hezekiah’s life. God also lifted Sennacherib’s siege of
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Not all Isaiah’s words were light. Isaiah 5 explicitly
applies the following to Israel, and in context it refers to the
coming Babylonian exile. Nevertheless, the words eerily
describe the 27th generation, too. The Emperor Justinian
faced foreign foes, like the Sassanid Empire, deadly rioting,
a climate shock, famine, and a plague that ties the HIV
epidemic for third place among the worst in history. Here
are a few parallels. The Plague of Justinian of 541 AD killed
so many wealthy estate holders and servants that crops
could not be harvested, causing famine:</p>

<h4>“Surely the great houses will become desolate,</h4>

<h5>the fine mansions left without occupants.</h5>

<h4>A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine;</h4>

<h5>a homer of seed will yield only an ephah of grain...</h5>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>Therefore Death expands its jaws,</h4>

<h5>opening wide its mouth;</h5>

<h4>into it will descend their nobles and masses</h4>

<h5>with all their brawlers and revelers.”</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 5:9-10,14</h6>

<p>The plague and famine intensified due to years of cold
weather following the year of darkness, 536 AD:</p>

<h4>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil,</h4>

<h4>who put <strong>darkness for light</strong> and <strong>light for darkness</strong>,</h4>

<h4>who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</h4>

<p>The darkness in turn was caused by a volcanic eruption
in Iceland, where the mountain (volcano) shook and the
rock (lava) burned:</p>

<h4>Therefore the LORD’s <strong>anger burns</strong> against his people;</h4>

<h5>his hand is raised and he strikes them down.</h5>

<h4><strong>The mountains shake</strong>,</h4>

<h5><strong>and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 5:25</h6>

<p>Even the grave diggers died, leaving no one to bury the
bodies. The plague posed only a brief interruption in
Justinian’s wars in the south, west, north and east.</p>

<h4>He lifts up a banner for the <strong>distant nations</strong>,</h4>

<h5>he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.</h5>

<h4>Here they come, swiftly and speedily!</h4>

<h4>... Their roar is like that of the <strong>lion</strong>,</h4>

<h5>they roar like <strong>young lions</strong>;</h5>

<h4>they growl as they seize their prey</h4>

<h5>and carry it off with no one to rescue.</h5>

<p>Justinian’s toughest opponent was King Khosrau I of the
Persian Sassanid Empire, whose emblem was a lion.</p>

<h4>And if one looks at the land,</h4>

<h5>there is only darkness and distress;</h5>

<h6>even the <strong>sun will be darkened by clouds</strong>.</h6>

<h6>- Isaiah 5:25-30, NIV</h6>

<p>The volcanic ash left Europe and Asia fogbound for
eighteen months, with eruptions in 536, 540, and 547
prolonging the misery. Average summer temperatures
dropped 35° F! The earth would not fully warm back up for
another 150 years.</p>

<p>Darkness, and darkness again? Look closer! Though light
was driven from the sky and peace from the earth, the
latter time had a light that did not come from the sun.
Benedict of Nursia drew up a rule for a balanced life.
Drawing members from the nobility down to serfs, all
adopted <em>ora et labora</em> – pray and work – as their motto. With
all classes of people engaging in manual labor, a
revolutionary practice, a new kind of egalitarian
community arose. Benedict sought to prescribe “nothing
harsh, nothing burdensome”, but moderation in all things.</p>

<p>How great the gulf between modern revolutionaries and
this sensible man! Reflect on the spirit in these words:</p>

<h4>[The abbot] must be aware of his own frailty and</h4>

<h4>remember that it is forbidden to break the already</h4>

<h4>bruised reed. We do not mean that he should countenance</h4>

<h4>the growth of vice but that he use discretion and</h4>

<h4>tenderness as he sees it expedient for the different</h4>

<h4>characters of his brothers. He is to endeavor much more</h4>

<h4>to be loved than to be feared.</h4>

<h6>– Benedict of Nursia, AD 547</h6>

<p>Those words are light. As their world fell apart and the
light of the sun failed, the Benedictines kept their pledge to
uphold three values: stability, fidelity and obedience. They
kept learning and culture alive across the centuries when
few others would.</p>

<p>Later in that generation, after Totila totally trashed
Rome, Pope Gregory called to Constantinople for help and
got nothing. Then he learned that with God on your side,
you don’t need an army. Through diplomacy he saved lives.
With food from church lands, he fed the poor and cared for
refugees. And when survival was all that could be expected,
Gregory had vision: he sent missionaries with the light of
the gospel to England. Where Jonah was a reluctant
missionary to his people’s enemies, Pope Gregory sent the
gospel of peace to make English pagans friends.</p>

<p>Darkness, plague and war, rich oppressing poor – both
generations endured these ills, but the church learned
through it how brightly shines the light of Christ.</p>

<h3>#15 (933-814 BC) vs. #28 (614-733 AD). <em>Idol minds</em>.</h3>

<p>Civil war permanently split Israel of the 15th generation
in two, but God did not immediately abandon the northern
kingdom. He dispatched Elijah to draw the people back to
Him. In a grand showdown on Mount Carmel in 1 Kings 18,
Elijah challenged the priests of Baal to a duel. After God
refused to hear their prayers but answered Elijah’s with fire
from heaven, they seized the priests of Baal and killed
them. Despite this victory, Ahab, Jezebel and Israel refused
to cease worshiping Baal. They craved its sexual revelry
and callously continued to offer their children to the
flames. Israel would ultimately be destroyed by Assyria,
while Elijah was honored for his courage and faithfulness
by being carried alive to heaven through a whirlwind in a
chariot of fire.</p>

<p>Was Baal worship a fading memory by the 28th? No, he
merely filed a change of address form with the post office.
That false God began as Bel of Babylon, moved west to
Canaan as Baal, then was carried south from Moab to
Nabataea as Hubal, before arriving in Arabia. There as
Hubal, he was enshrined as chief idol among the 360 being
worshiped at the Kaaba in Mecca.</p>

<p>Before this idol lay seven arrows used for divination. By
these arrows, Abdul Mutallib divined which of his ten sons
to sacrifice to receive Hubal’s blessing. Then in a fit of
buyer’s remorse, he consulted a sage and used the arrows
again to bargain the price down to a hundred camels,
sparing his son Abd-Allah, future father of Mohammed.</p>

<p>When Mohammed captured Mecca from the Quraysh,
the protectors of Hubal, he smashed the idols, and Hubal
was no more. Then Mohammed campaigned throughout
the region, rooting out every trace of Baal worship he could
find. In this, he was a servant of God, finishing what Elijah
began.</p>

<p>Destroying idols is definitely a “no Baal” cause.</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>Destroying idols is definitely </p>
  <p>a “no Baal” cause.</p>
</div>

<p>Christians are skeptical of Islamic claims. However, in
their legends we find another parallel to the life of Elijah.
The Quran and Hadith relate a journey Mohammed
undertook ca 621 AD. On the back of Buraq, a white,
diminutive, winged horse, he flew to the farthest mosque,
to Jerusalem. This was the first part of his Night Journey,
called Isra. During Mi’raj, the second stage, Mohammed
flew up to heaven.</p>

<p>Surely God arranged for this legend to become enshrined
in the holy books and hearts of over a billion people so that
this connection between Elijah and Mohammed would be
unmistakable. Yet if that were not enough, the end of the
28th generation saw the beginning of the iconoclast
controversy over the use of images in the church.</p>

<h3>#14 (1052-933 BC) vs. #29 (733-852 AD). <em>Kings</em>.</h3>

<p>The anarchy of Judges and instability of a mad and
faithless king (Saul) ended in the 14th generation. King
David served Israel with a broken and contrite heart, and
Solomon, with a wise intellect. The temple was built and all
Israel had one place to worship and find unity.</p>

<p>The 29th generation found the continent an equally
chaotic place. Europe was moving in two directions at
once. Spiritually, it was drifting apart. Politically, it was
coming together. As a church, 787 AD brought the Second
Council of Nicaea. This was the last of the seven ecumenical
councils, the last time the eastern and western churches
came together in agreement, to restore the veneration of
images as licit.</p>

<p>On the political front, by 800 AD, all of Western Europe
was ruled by Christian kings. Chief among them was
Charlemagne, the Holy Roman Emperor. He reformed the
law while his counselor Alcuin reformed and extended the
spread of education. In Eriugena, Charlemagne’s
successors were blessed with the most brilliant philosopher
for over half a millennium, a fitting counterpart to
Solomon. In Charlemagne, it had a warrior who fought
tirelessly to expand Christendom.</p>

<h3>#13 (1171-1052 BC) vs. #30 (852-971 AD). <em>Church &amp; State</em>.</h3>

<p>The anarchic 13th generation had someone famous and
someone obscure. Samson possessed physical strength but
was possessed by moral weakness. Micah (not the prophet)
possessed mental shrewdness but was dispossessed by
stronger men. In both cases, the fate of faith and tribe
rested on the same shoulders.</p>

<p>Micah’s story (in Judges 17 &amp; 18) is bizarre. He stole his
mother’s silver, gave it back when he heard that she cursed
the thief, then got her to hire a silversmith to make an idol
from the silver. He built a shrine, bought household gods
and other pagan religious artifacts – and then he bought a
Levite priest! The pay was good so the priest stayed,
overlooking the corrupt religious practices of his new boss.
Micah felt he had it made; to him, employing a priest was a
good luck charm (and revenue source!), not a matter of the
heart. His priest even blessed a raid against a peaceful
nearby town. When a bunch of Danites came along, they
coveted Micah’s situation. They confiscated his silver idol,
gods, religious implements – and his priest. The Danites
worshiped Micah’s idol a long time. Dan would be the first
tribe to fall away. And that corrupted priest abetted their
lust for conquest by blessing unjust wars. This tale is an
example of what happens when the secular sphere
(wealthy people and the state) control the sacred.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the 30th generation. Russia was
converted to Christianity. Russians admire Samson’s
strength. In fact, Russians credit Samson for their victory
over Sweden 800 years later in the Great Northern War.</p>

<p>A more tangible connection between the two eras is
found in the Cluniac reforms. Prestigious positions in
Benedictine monasteries like the one at Cluny in France
were awarded by noblemen whose contributions founded
them or kept them afloat. Once again, the wealthy and the
state controlled the leadership of the church. Abbeys were
run like businesses, and the noblemen squeezed so much
profit from them that the monks were impoverished.
During this era, monasteries fought for greater
independence and won. After this, Cluny and the thousand
branches it established refocused their efforts on serving
the poor, reversed the laxity in their religious practices,
and became patrons for learning and the arts. The
movement spread from France to England, Spain and Italy.</p>

<p>This drive for religious freedom led in later generations
to the Investiture controversy, the Magna Carta in England,
the Protestant Reformation, and the disestablishment of
the church in America. From this the world learned that
the church cannot preach a message of freedom and people
cannot live a life of freedom if either are in chains.</p>

<h3>#12 (1290-1171 BC) vs. #31 (971-1090 AD). <em>Courage</em>.</h3>

<p><em>Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum</em> 
("Therefore let him who desires peace get ready for war.") 
So the Roman dictum goes. Before sharpening sword and saddling
horse, what is the first preparation each soldier must make
when readying for war? He must find his courage. Or she...</p>

<p>The Israelites of the 12th generation faced two enemies:
drought and Midianites. The Great Drought lasted fifty
years, capping off three centuries of declining rainfall. It
brought down empires and ended the Bronze Age. Ancient
Greece, Mycenae, the Hittites, Kassites, New Kingdom of
Egypt, and more... All gone. Every city between Pylos in
Greece and Gaza was burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>During the drought, Ruth and Naomi lost their husbands
and migrated from Moab to Israel. What courage and
composure Ruth displayed. She had to adopt strange
customs, a strange religion, a strange language and glean
for food among strange men. Any man could have attacked
her. Her only defense was her new faith in her mother-in-
law’s God. She found a protector and new husband in Boaz.
Surely her great grandson David got some of his courage
from her!</p>

<p>Near the end of this generation, the Israelites were
oppressed by Midian. Gideon was hiding in a winepress, so
the Midianites wouldn’t catch him threshing grain, steal it
and kill him. What did God’s angel say to him? 
<em>“The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.”</em> (Judges 6:12, NIV) 
The angel was wise in what he said and what he did not say. He did not
say, “Courageous warrior.” What followed was God testing
Gideon and Gideon testing God. Through those tests,
Gideon found his courage, led his people into battle,
defeated their enemies, and seized an even greater prize.</p>

<p>In his first encounter, one marvelous thing stands out.
Fire shoots out from the angel’s staff, consuming the
sacrifice and terrifying Gideon.</p>

<h4>When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD,</h4>

<h4>he exclaimed,</h4>

<h5>“Alas, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD</h5>

<h5>face to face!”</h5>

<h4>But the LORD said to him,</h4>

<h5>“Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.”</h5>

<h4>So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it</h4>

<h4>The LORD Is Peace...</h4>

<h6>- Judges 6:22-24, NIV</h6>

<p>Through all his trials, Gideon learned that the fear of the
Lord leads to courage, courage to obedience, and
obedience to peace. Peace was Gideon’s prize.</p>

<p>Did the 31st generation experience dramatic climate
change, like the 12th? Yes. Did it suffer from drought? Yes,
but only if you lived in North or South America! That
drought lasted centuries, toppled civilizations and left both
continents ripe for conquest when the Europeans finally
arrived. However the start of this generation occurred
when the Medieval Warm Period reached its peak
temperature. The unusually favorable climate enabled the
population of Europe to nearly double during this time.</p>

<p>Europe did not have Midianites to worry about, but
Vikings and Muslims. Christianity was finally starting to
spread throughout Scandinavia, leaving the the threat of
Islam to the south and east as the greater concern.</p>

<p>Though European kingdoms were no strangers to war,
Europe was at a disadvantage. Islam was solidly behind
expansionist wars to expand <em>Dar al-Islam</em>, so its political
and religious leaders were united in their efforts.
Christianity was different. Its goal was peace. The savagery
of war was repellant to the devout. This division between
spiritual and material aspirations caused friction between
king and Pope and undercut morale. The solution was the
“Peace of God” movement, and its extension, the “Truce of
God”. Rules were drawn up binding soldiers to spare the
lives of clergy, women, children, and non-combatant
peasants. It was the Geneva Convention of its time.</p>

<p>With a “Christian” way to wage war, the Pope could
sanction just wars and promise believers absolution if they
took up arms to advance the faith. The first test of this was
the church endorsing the Reconquista in Spain. The second
would follow in the next generation: the rise of chivalry and
the launch of the Crusades. When you combine a warm
climate, a growing population, and the religious zeal that
God is on your side, many are the unexpected things you
will find, but first comes courage. “The Lord is Peace”
because He fights for it – and fights for us.</p>

<h3>#11 (1409-1290 BC) vs. #32 (1090-1209 AD). <em>Civil war</em>.</h3>

<p>In the 11th generation, the tribe of Judah briefly captured
Jerusalem. In the 32nd, Christians captured Jerusalem from
the Moslems during the First Crusade in 1099 AD, but lost it
to Saladin in 1187 AD.</p>

<p>However in both eras, jubilation over capturing an
important city was overshadowed by civil war. During the
11th, the incident at Gibeah led to the near annihilation of
the tribe of Benjamin at the hand of the other eleven tribes
( Judges 20). Then in the 32nd generation, the Fourth
Crusade went south. Instead of attacking Muslims, as
intended, the crusaders sacked Christian Constantinople
instead. This hastened the decline of Byzantium and its
eventual destruction in the 15th century. Sadly, the church’s
increase in zeal and courage was not matched by an equal
increase in wisdom.</p>

<p>Looking at pairs of generations up close, it is easy to
overlook larger trends. Civil strife is endemic to all
civilizations and all times, but Israel and the church
endured critical episodes with monumental effects.</p>

<p>At the start of the <strong>15th generation</strong>, civil war split
Israel in two. At the end of the <strong>28th generation</strong>, the
Iconoclast Controversy began to heat up, which
divided the Eastern church and also drove an early
wedge between the Eastern and Western churches.</p>

<p>In the <strong>12th generation</strong>, we find the middle of the time
of the Judges. The Danites stole idols and a Levite
from Micah, then set up a shrine in Laish competing
with Shiloh, contravening the Law of Moses. In
addition, they seized territory that was not assigned
to them for conquest. It is difficult to place these
events in time. They possibly occurred in the 11th
generation, but Dan’s crime was said to continue for
many generations, until the ark of the covenant
moved from Shiloh, so their rebelliousness persisted
through this 12th generation. In the <strong>31st generation</strong>,
the Great Schism split east and west permanently.
Thus because of Micah, Israel had two places to
worship when they should have had one. Because
Pope and Patriarch could not agree, Christians were
divided into two weaker churches when they could
have had one strong church.</p>

<p><strong>In the 11th generation</strong>, the crisis over Gibeah led to
civil war between Benjamin and the other eleven
tribes. In the <strong>32nd generation</strong>, the Fourth Crusade
pitted western Christians against Constantinople.</p>

<p>In the <strong>9th generation</strong>, after the incident with the
Golden Calf, the tribe of Levi remained loyal and
fought against the other tribes to restore order. In the
<strong>34th generation</strong>, the Byzantine Empire pleaded for
help from the west. The terms were rejected
(accepting the Pope as supreme and others), no help
was given, and in the following generation,
Constantinople fell.</p>

<p>In the <strong>8th generation</strong>, Joseph’s brothers sold him into
slavery. In the <strong>35th generation</strong>, the Protestant
Reformation splintered the western church into many
denominations.</p>

<p>In the <strong>7th generation</strong>, family strife began before there
were twelve tribes. Jacob contended with his brother
Esau starting in the womb, his mother conspired with
him against brother and father, and his uncle Laban
perpetually cheated him in his wages. Pair this with
the Thirty Years War of the <strong>36th generation</strong> where
the Protestant and Catholic Churches were at each
other’s throats “from birth”.</p>

<p>By these pairings, we see that the six worst of the
breaches of the peace within the house of Israel stand
opposite the six worst breaches in the history of the
church. In the order given, the division of Israel begins with
its final, irrevocable split and works back to its small scale
origin within a single family. The division in the church
proceeds in the opposite direction, from small rifts that
could have been healed to continent wide destruction.</p>

<p>From Jacob to Jesus to the Wars of Religion we have
fifteen pairs of generations. The odds that the six worst
episodes of civil strife in the left column would match the
six worst in the right by chance are 5,000 to one against.</p>

<p>Does this mean God causes discord, dissension, factions
and fighting? No, it means He channels them into
productive ends. If not for the mercy and sovereignty of
God, there would have been fifteen pairs of generations of
total war and zero of unity and peace.</p>

<h3>#10 (1528-1409 BC) vs. #33 (1209-1328 AD). <em>Pilgrims</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>10th</strong>, Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised
Land more by faith than force of arms. In the <strong>33rd</strong>, the
knights of the 6th crusade recaptured Jerusalem from the
Moslems for a few years. However, more impressive is what
Francis of Assisi did during the 5th crusade. The crusaders
marched against Egypt in force and were slaughtered.
Francis marched to the Sultan of Egypt in humility and was
granted permission to escort pilgrims to the Holy Land.</p>

<h3>#9 (1647-1528 BC) vs. #34 (1328-1447 AD). <em>Plague</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>9th</strong> generation, Moses devastated Egypt with ten
plagues and led his people to freedom. Never before nor
since has God in a single campaign explicitly, notoriously,
purposefully and powerfully opposed one people and
simultaneously defended and championed another. God
took sides. He stood up to the slave masters and set the
prisoners free.</p>

<p>In the <strong>34th</strong> generation, God did the unthinkable: he
smote not His enemies but His church with the Black
Death, the worst plague in human history. Why? We may
have our answer in Creator Omnium (1434 AD) and Sicut
dudum (1435 AD), issued by Pope Eugene IV, forbidding the
enslavement of the natives of the Canary Islands and
commanding their emancipation and the restoration of
their property on pain of excommunication. This was the
first salvo in the church’s centuries long war against slavery.
God disciplined the church for permitting the slave trade
with blows even harsher than he used against ancient
Egypt. The blows would not stop but only intensify until
slavery was abolished throughout the world.</p>

<h3>#8 (1766-1647 BC) vs. #35 (1447-1566 AD). <em>Justification</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>8th</strong>, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers,
then rose to the stature of a king, second only to pharaoh.
What freed him? God’s grace (the ability to interpret
dreams) and his faith. In the end, Joseph forgave his
brothers, setting them free from guilt.</p>

<p>In the <strong>35th</strong>, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans and
thousands of Christians were killed or became enslaved. In
1517 AD, the Ottomans captured Jerusalem. Out of that
cataclysm arose the Protestant Reformation, when Martin
Luther made the discovery that shook the foundations of
the world.</p>

<p>Many condemn the church for failing to take action
earlier against slavery. If your spirit is in bondage to the law
of sin and death, you cannot be free. No individual, family,
city, or kingdom can be freed without this truth.</p>

<p>The church could not set men free, because it lacked the
key to man’s shackles. The words were on the page but not
in the heart. When Luther first found them, they terrified
him as unobtainable, so much did the wrath of God’s
righteous judgment frighten him. He wore himself out in
prayer trying to understand them, until the Sprit quickened
his mind:</p>

<h4>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because</h4>

<h4>it is the power of God that brings salvation to</h4>

<h4>everyone who believes: first to the Jew,</h4>

<h4>then to the Gentile. For in the gospel the</h4>

<h4>righteousness of God is revealed—</h4>

<h4>a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,</h4>

<h4>just as it is written:</h4>

<h5><strong>“The righteous will live by faith.”</strong></h5>

<h6>- Romans 1:16-17, NIV</h6>

<p>Was the Holy Spirit the sole cause of Luther’s revolution
in thought? No! The false idea of justification holding him in
bondage was the active process of being made righteous
through infused grace that slowly reforms the actions of the
sinner. It was based on the Latin translation of Romans.
Luther’s insight arose when he read the Greek version,
which spoke of a passive and foreign righteousness given to
us through faith.</p>

<p>Why did Luther have access to a good Greek translation
and the training to use it? Because of the Fall of
Constantinople and the diaspora of Greek scholars fleeing
the Ottomans. From Christianity’s greatest military setback
came its greatest liberating idea. Righteousness is a gift.
With that, the charges are dropped and the prisoner may
walk free.</p>

<h3>#7 (1885-1766 BC) vs. #36 (1566-1685 AD). <em>Persecution</em>.</h3>

<p>The <strong>7th generation</strong> was known for two people: Isaac and
Job, who suffered severe persecution but remained faithful.</p>

<p>The <strong>37th generation</strong> saw the persecution of the
Huguenots in France of the late 16th century and the
General Crisis of the 17th century. Millions died because of
religious persecution, but the truth God had revealed to
them could not be extinguished, any more than Job could
be silenced.</p>

<p>The Roman persecutions lasted long and had been
severe, but this was different. Just as Job was persecuted by
his family and his three friends, so the martyred Christians
in the latter generation died at the hands of other
Christians.</p>

<h3>#6 (2004-1885 BC) vs. #37 (1685-1804 AD). <em>Holiness</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>6th generation</strong>, God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah for its violence, sexual immorality and
inhospitality. By this exercise of power, He breathed a
measure of morality into a decadent society through
external pressure.</p>

<p>In the <strong>37th</strong>, the Holy Spirit came upon the church in
America and England in the First and Second Great
Awakenings. People were convicted on the inside and the
morals of society improved markedly. In England,
Wilberforce pushed for a “reformation of manners”. That
enterprise created a spiritual climate conducive to the anti-
slavery movement.</p>

<p>Note the difference. In the former generation, God
destroyed cities because they contained no holy people. In
the latter, he saved cities by making people holy. A people
set free from inward sin were able to free themselves from
external tyranny, and so America was born and England
turned from slave master into freedom fighter.</p>

<h3>#5 (2123-2004 BC) vs. #38 (1804-1923 AD). <em>Life &amp; Freedom</em>.</h3>

<p>About the <strong>5th generation</strong> we know little. Archeologists
only see signs of slavery where people settle into towns and
cultivate the land, not nomadic cultures. Since the 4th
generation saw people forced to spread out after Babel as
nomads, this era saw slavery take hold as the new nations
began to settle down. One thing we can be certain about is
that people’s lifespans began to shorten, as seen in the
genealogies of Genesis.</p>

<p>In the <strong>38th generation</strong>, the anti-slavery movement and
American Civil War abolished slavery in most of the world.
Due to their wealth and improvements in diet and
medicine, the average lifespan of the English began to rise,
a reversal of Genesis. That trend would reach the rest of the
world in the next generation.</p>

<p>The reversal in the course of mankind’s physical and
spiritual life is stark. To go from a world of increasing
wickedness and shortening lives to one of lengthening lives
and increased holiness proves that God’s way works.</p>

<h3>#4 (2242-2123 BC) vs. #39 (1923-2042 AD). <em>Diversity</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>4th generation</strong>, God destroyed the Tower of Babel,
confused man’s language, and dispersed the many new
races to the four corners of the earth. He did this so that all
of humanity would not live under a single unified, absolute,
idolatrous tyranny, with no way out for anyone. When
language, culture, religion, politics, and commerce all
converge in a single evil system, all hope is lost. No one has
the strength to withstand such concentrated power. No one
can resist Leviathan.</p>

<p>In the <strong>39th generation</strong>... That’s us! We see the opposite
trend. Today one sixth of the earth’s people speak English.
Air and automotive travel connect us. The League of
Nations, followed by the United Nations, attempt to resolve
our disputes. The Internet permits knowledge to be shared
instantaneously across the planet. The dividing and
scattering that began at Babel is rapidly reversing, but it has
hit a snag.</p>

<p>Among the gravest challenges faced by the world in this
generation is racism. Jim Crow, the Holocaust, Rwanda,
Japanese Internment, Sudan, Tibet, the Uygurs... We must
overcome our differences and learn to live with each other
in peace – not by force, as at Babel – but by choice and
grace. Look how long the fight against slavery took! If that
battle was won, but this one remains, then racism must be
more ingrained in our nature and harder to uproot.</p>

<p>How long will this battle take?</p>

<h3>#3 (2361-2242 BC) vs. #40 (2042-2161 AD). <em>Government</em>.</h3>

<p>The <strong>3rd generation</strong> began with the Flood. Afterwards,
God made a covenant with Noah. Part of it was this:</p>

<h4>“Whoever sheds human blood,</h4>

<h5>by humans shall their blood be shed;</h5>

<h5>for in the image of God</h5>

<h4>has God made mankind.</h4>

<h6>- Genesis 9:6, NIV</h6>

<p>The authorization of capital punishment for murder is
considered the start of human government. Often abused,
currently neglected, this is a solemn command. Jesus did
not revoke it. At one time, the whole world enforced capital
punishment. Today only two thirds of the world’s people
live in countries that permit it. Among many of them, it is
seldom employed.</p>

<p>What will happen in the <strong>40th generation</strong>? The positive
trend of opposing discrimination and punishments based
on characteristics falsely labeled as inferior or evil will
continue to be hijacked by the devil. As the language of
toleration and acceptance spreads to encompass more
actually evil behavior, society will be rendered defenseless
against wickedness. Capital punishment will be outlawed in
more jurisdictions and police will find their hands tied.
Anarchy will spread. God’s covenant with Noah will be
abrogated.</p>

<p>As the third generation began with the flood, the 40th
will end in war.</p>

<h3>#2 (3090-2361 BC) vs. #41 (2161-2280 AD). <em>Mortality</em>?</h3>

<p>Near the end of the <strong>2nd generation</strong>, God decreed that no
human life would exceed 120 years. Thus near the
beginning of the <strong>41st</strong>, genetic engineers will discover how
to reverse this curse and stop the aging process. As a
consequence, this generation may endure well beyond
2280 AD.</p>

<p>The trend of the 2nd generation was towards increasing
wickedness. The 41st will do the same.</p>

<p>The most significant event of the 2nd generation is not
what happened at its end – the Flood of Noah. It is what
happened near its beginning. Assuming that generations
overlap by a single year and the creation was in 4020 BC,
the signal event of this time occurred in 3039 BC.</p>

<h4>Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years.</h4>

<h4>Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more,</h4>

<h4>because God took him away.</h4>

<h6>- Genesis 5:23-24, NIV</h6>

<p>Enoch was taken up to heaven before he died, about fifty-
one years after Adam died. Enoch’s translation is a type of
the Rapture of the Church. By symmetry, going in reverse,
will the rapture occur fifty-one years before the end of the
forty-first generation? If the final war between Christ and
antichrist lasts one prophetic hour – which is one twenty-
fourth of a millennium, or 41.67 years – then there is time
for a pre-war rapture. Christians debate whether the
rapture will occur before the Tribulation, during it, or at
the end. This correspondence between the 2nd and 41st
generations suggests, but cannot prove, a pre-war rapture.
My personal conviction is that Christ returns at the end of
the battle and the rapture occurs then; my hope is that it
comes earlier.</p>

<p>This match between God’s blessing on Enoch in the 2nd
generation and the church’s great hope in the Second
Coming of Christ at the end of the 41st rounds things out.
The Father has woven His every promise into the patterns
of history so that we may put our faith in His Son.</p>

<h3>#1 (4020-3090 BC) vs. #42 (2280-? AD). <em>Homecoming</em>.</h3>

<p>In the <strong>1st generation</strong>, Adam and Eve were exiled from
Eden to a world of suffering. In the <strong>42nd</strong>, the second Adam
will escort us to a place fairer than Eden, and a peace no
one but God has ever known.</p>

<h2>What do we see in the Mirror?</h2>

<p>This “Cosmic Chiasm” demonstrates how the history of
the world since Christ rose from the dead mirrors events
written down long ago in the Bible. It proves God is
sovereign over all of history and foresees all that has come
to pass or will come to pass. It testifies to the miraculous
and accurate nature of His Word. About the few
generations that remain before the pattern runs its course,
the chiasm permits us to make educated guesses about
what lies in store for the church and the rest of humanity.
What it does not do is explain why God has structured
history this way. For that we must turn to an enigmatic
scroll tightly bound.</p>
