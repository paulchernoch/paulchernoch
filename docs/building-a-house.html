        <h1>Building a House</h1>
        <h2>Ecclesiastes 10</h2>
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-05-12</p>
        
        <p>How many times can a person read Ecclesiastes 10 and not notice what metaphor the author is using?
In my case, many! The following passage has two riddles:</p>

<ul>
<li>The easy riddle of what metaphor ties all the parables together</li>
<li>The difficult riddle of what that metaphor prophesies</li>
</ul>

<p>For decades I could not even solve the easy riddle. Perhaps you can. Here are the verses.
What is the author talking about?</p>

<h4><sup>5</sup> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun,</h4>

<h4>as it were an error proceeding from the ruler:</h4>

<h4><sup>6</sup> folly is set in many high places, and the rich</h4>

<h4>sit in a low place. <sup>7</sup> I have seen slaves on horses,</h4>

<h5>and princes walking on the ground like slaves.</h5>

<h4><sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit will fall into it,</h4>

<h5>and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.</h5>

<h4><sup>9</sup> He who quarries stones is hurt by them,</h4>

<h5>and he who splits logs is endangered by them.</h5>

<h4><sup>10</sup> If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge,</h4>

<h5>he must use more strength,</h5>

<h6>but wisdom helps one to succeed.</h6>

<h4><sup>11</sup> If the serpent bites before it is charmed,</h4>

<h5>there is no advantage to the charmer.</h5>

<h4><sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor,</h4>

<h5>but the lips of a fool consume him.</h5>

<h4><sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,</h4>

<h5>and the end of his talk is evil madness.</h5>

<h4><sup>14</sup> A fool multiplies words,</h4>

<h5>though no man knows what is to be,</h5>

<h6>and who can tell him what will be after him?</h6>

<h4><sup>15</sup> The toil of a fool wearies him,</h4>

<h5>for he does not know the way to the city.</h5>

<h4><sup>16</sup> Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,</h4>

<h5>and your princes feast in the morning!</h5>

<h4><sup>17</sup> Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility,</h4>

<h5>and your princes feast at the proper time,</h5>

<h6>for strength, and not for drunkenness!</h6>

<h4><sup>18</sup> Through sloth the roof sinks in,</h4>

<h5>and through indolence the house leaks.</h5>

<h4><sup>19</sup> Bread is made for laughter,</h4>

<h5>and wine gladdens life,</h5>

<h6>and money answers everything.</h6>

<h4><sup>20</sup> Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king,</h4>

<h5>nor in your bedroom curse the rich,</h5>

<h4>for a bird of the air will carry your voice,</h4>

<h5>or some winged creature tell the matter.</h5>

<p>The focus of this website is the architecture of Lady Wisdom's House.
This riddle is not about her house. It is about ours.
The central metaphor, if you have not figured it out yet, is the building of a house.
It follows the whole process, from digging a hole for the the foundation to hammering down the roof.
Each building activity is a separate parable and each parable a prophecy. 
Together they combine to describe the building of a new civilization: our civilization.</p>

<p>The Book of Ecclesiastes gives us a view of life in which our years may be divided into three parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ascending Years (birth to maturity, in twenty-eight times, up to age 49)</li>
<li>Productive years (age 50-61)</li>
<li>Declining Years (62+)</li>
</ul>

<p>Solomon devotes most of the book to the first part of life, the ascending years.
The productive years are covered in chapter 10 and the start of chapter 11.
How interesting this warning is for Americans:</p>

<h4>So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;</h4>

<h4>but let him remember that <strong>the days of darkness will be many</strong>.</h4>

<h4>All that comes is vanity.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 11:8</h6>

<p>When financial catastrophe strikes an American, they may have to file for bankruptcy.
We call that "Filing for Chapter 11" by reference to a section of our legal code. 
That is a "day of darkness" indeed, and often spells the beginning of a person's
declining years. This article is not about that. It is about the part of the productive years
described in chapter 10. The ideas were originally presented in a short section of the 
chapter named <a href="./grandfather-clock.html">A Grand Father Clock &amp; a Silver Cord</a> from <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.</p>

<p>In that book, I introduced Fractal Historicism, a novel theory of eschatology. An important
component of that theory is that the same pattern may apply to different scales of time.
Thus the twenty-eight times of Solomon describe:</p>

<ul>
<li>the course of one person's life, from birth to death</li>
<li>the history of ancient Israel and the Church, from 960 BC until Christ returns</li>
<li>the history of modern Israel, from the Holocaust until Christ returns</li>
<li>the history of the world, from the Creation until Christ returns</li>
</ul>

<p>The chapter in question was dealing with the last and largest time scale, which I called the Grand Father Clock.
It divided world history into four parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Growth Years</strong>: 28 periods of 175 years (4900 years total), <em>from 4020 BC to 880 AD</em></li>
<li><strong>Middle Years</strong>: 12 periods of 100 years (1200 years total), <em>from 880 to 2080 AD</em></li>
<li><strong>Declining Years</strong>: 2 periods of 100 years (200 years total), <em>from 2080 to 2280 AD</em></li>
<li><strong>Death</strong>: 1 period of less than a century (likely 30-50 years), <em>from 2280 AD until Christ returns</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The riddle in this article concerns the Middle Years, from 880-2080 AD. Those years have nearly run their course.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Productive Years (880-2080 AD)</h2>

<p>At this point the Grand Father Clock strikes ten – chapter
ten. This chapter of Ecclesiastes is all about work. To break
it into pieces we do not have “under the sun” as an easy
delimiter as we did for the times, nor the word
“remember” as we will find in the next section. Instead,
each part concerns a single facet of work. The sections
range from half a verse to four verses in length. Each is a
parable of great subtlety.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter, the opening of the seals of
Revelation was likened to the pulling down of scaffolding to
reveal a new building. The old political, religious, economic
and cultural systems were torn away to reveal the new.
Along the same vein, this chapter describes the building of
a great house. Forgive me for updating the analogies.</p>

<p>Note: Solomon also used the metaphor of a house
prophetically in Psalm 127, as explored in “Appendix D: To
Number our Psalms”.</p>

<h3>Hiring the GC (880-980 AD).</h3>

<h4>There is an evil I have seen under the sun,</h4>

<h4>the sort of error that arises from a ruler:</h4>

<h4>Fools are put in many high positions,</h4>

<h4>while the rich occupy the low ones.</h4>

<h4>I have seen slaves on horseback,</h4>

<h4>while princes go on foot like slaves. (10:5-7)</h4>

<p>To begin, we need a GC - a general contractor. Once
people reach their most productive years, recruiting,
interviewing and hiring competent and trustworthy people
is a vital concern. In these verses, Solomon tells us that
from the start, things wouldn’t go well. From Pope Sergius
III to Pope John XII, the selection of church leaders
succumbed to the murderous scheming of Theodora and
Marozia during the "rule of the harlots". Spiritually, this was
one of the darkest times for the church.</p>

<p>This era is known for one significant positive event. Near
the beginning of the tenth century, in Aleppo, Syria, the
Aleppo Codex was written by Jewish scholars. This was the
most important and influential copy of the Masoretic Text
of the Old Testament to be created. Descendants of that
text influenced the translation of the King James Bible.</p>

<h3>Digging the Foundation (980-1080 AD).</h3>

<h4>Whoever digs a pit may fall into it... (10:8a)</h4>

<p>Trench collapse is a common cause of injury and death in
construction. Two decades ago, fifty workers a year died in
the trenches in the US, prompting OSHA to conduct a major
study and tighten standards. One discovery was that at
many job sites, the supervising engineer never bothered to
ascertain the soil type before planning the excavation.
Knowing the soil type is one of the most crucial factors in
understanding and mitigating risk. Jesus preached a whole
sermon on the importance of knowing what type of soil
each person is: beaten path, rocky, thorny or good. Jesus
would have made a good construction engineer.</p>

<p>This verse, however, talks about a different kind of pit:
schism. In 1054, the Great Schism finally and irrevocably
split the church into East and West. The English word
schism comes from the Greek σχίσμα, which means
division, cleft, fissure, or break. The fissure that opened up
between the two halves of Christendom would lead to the
death or suffering of millions. The cost of digging the
foundation for our house was great.</p>

<h3>Demolition &amp; Site Prep (1080-1180 AD).</h3>

<h4>... whoever breaks through a wall</h4>

<h4>may be bitten by a snake. (10:8b)</h4>

<p>During excavation, the remains of previous construction
may be uncovered. Old walls will have to be demolished
and hauled out of the pit. In this case, the walls needing to
be breached during the construction of Christendom were
the walls of Jerusalem during the First Crusade. The snakes
biting the workers were the soldiers of the Caliphate, the
empire associated with the seventh beast of Revelation.
Recall that with Satan bound for a thousand years
beginning in 380 AD, he is held behind a wall. If you reach
into his prison, he will bite! The Christian kingdoms had
been hemmed in for centuries by the relentless expansion
of Islam, but now they broke through the wall. However,
was it Christians breaking in, or Satan angling for a way to
break out?</p>

<h3>Deliveries &amp; Masonry Work (1180-1280 AD).</h3>

<h4>Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them... (10:9a)</h4>

<p>A modern work site sees an endless stream of trucks
dropping off supplies. The masonry work may require
marble, granite, brick, natural stone or cinder blocks. This
verse, about quarrying stone, is the most on-the-nose verse
in the chapter. This century was the peak of the age of
church building. Many of the great cathedrals were
constructed during this century. It is estimated that during
this phase of the establishment of Christendom, more stone
was quarried for churches than was used for all the
pyramids and temples of Ancient Egypt combined.</p>

<p>Not only buildings, but also vital church institutions were
built during this century. Religious orders like the
Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and Augustinians
trace their founding to this time.</p>

<p>Sadly, many of the common people who built the church
died at its hands due to injustice. During the Fourth
Crusade, Christian killed Christian when Constantinople
was sacked. The Inquisition began in 1184 AD and the
Albigensian Crusade was launched against the Cathars,
killing tens of thousands.</p>

<p>During the Albigensian Crusade, a French Cistercian
monk named Arnold Amalric acted as the Pope’s
representative. When the crusaders reached Beziers, a
soldier asked Amalric how they would distinguish between
the townspeople that were Catholics and the ones that were
Cathars. Amalric is reputed to have answered, “Kill them
all. God will recognize his own.” Over time, this has been
paraphrased as “Kill them all and let God sort them out.”
And that is how the builders were injured at their own
quarry.</p>

<h3>Carpentry &amp; Framing (1280-1380 AD).</h3>

<h4>... whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.</h4>

<h4>If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened,</h4>

<h4>more strength is needed,</h4>

<h4>but skill will bring success.</h4>

<h4>- Ecclesiastes 10:9b-10, NIV</h4>

<p>With the base of the building done, we can frame the
exterior and interior walls. In this verse, the emphasis is on
working with dull tools. What are those tools? Intellect.
Leadership. Coordination and cooperation. Character.
Public order. All were deficient during this tumultuous
century, forcing select people of ability to envision new
ways to organize society.</p>

<p>The Black Death was the shattering tragedy that forced
the issue, killing off half of Europe or more. The Avignon
Papacy (1309-1378 AD) had the Pope flee Rome for most of
the era, as well as having multiple popes claiming the title
at once. In the intellectual sphere, scholastic theology was
an attempt to sharpen the church’s reason and carry it
beyond the ideas of the ancient world. Some of its results
led in wrong directions and made faith complex and
unintelligible to the masses. Also, this cerebral approach
prompted opposition to the East’s focus on Hesychasm, a
personal, spiritual relationship with God. This era also saw
substantial development toward modern nation-states, the
interior walls between the new countries arising out of old
Rome. All in all, old, dull tools were being discarded in
search of sharp new ones to handle a new age.</p>

<h3>Zoning, Payables &amp; Receivables (1380-1480 AD).</h3>

<h4>If a snake bites before it is charmed,</h4>

<h4>the charmer receives no fee. (10:11)</h4>

<p>All of a sudden, the work stops. The electrician wants to
be paid up front but your bridge loan wasn’t approved by
the bank. The neighbors at the zoning board meeting
complain about increased traffic, site drainage, and the
height of the flag pole. The town building inspector says the
building code changed and the roof trusses must be spaced
closer. The bricklayers union goes on strike. It would be so
easy to just burn it down and collect the insurance...</p>

<p>This period began with the Western Schism (with more
multiplications of popes battling for legitimacy from
1378-1416 AD) and only got worse, as Constantinople fell to
the Turks in 1453 AD. After a thousand years of
confinement, Satan slipped his bonds and broke out of
prison in 1380 AD. Don’t pay the snake charmer: he fell
asleep on the job.</p>

<p>(Every eschatological system assigns a different time to
the imprisonment and release of Satan. The strength of the
system in this book is that the same event shows up in
many clocks at the same corresponding time, reinforcing
this assertion.)</p>

<h3>Marketing (1480-1580 AD).</h3>

<h4>Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious,</h4>

<h4>but fools are consumed by their own lips.</h4>

<h4>At the beginning their words are folly;</h4>

<h4>at the end they are wicked madness—</h4>

<h4>and <strong>fools multiply words</strong>.</h4>

<h4>No one knows what is coming—</h4>

<h4>who can tell someone else what will happen after them?</h4>

<h4>The toil of fools wearies them;</h4>

<h4>they do not know the way to town. (10:12-15)</h4>

<p>It is finally time to list the property with realtors. Can the
house we are building be successfully sold by the folks on
the TV show Million Dollar Listing? Before the open house,
it is smart to fill the rooms with furniture, hang a few
pictures, place vases of fresh cut flowers and cover the
kitchen island with tapas. During this century, the church
filled its house by plundering the New World of gold, silver,
firs, potatoes, tomatoes, maize and chocolate, fruits of the
Colombian Exchange.</p>

<p>However, the phrase from Ecclesiastes that best describes
this time is <em>“fools multiply words”</em>. At the close of the
previous century, Gutenberg created his first press (1439
AD) and printed his first Bible (1455 AD). Sure, the Chinese
already had moveable type, but they used ceramic type,
which didn’t hold the ink well, and used water-based
paints, which bled and faded fast. Gutenberg invented type
metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony, which was
durable but also easily moldable and held the ink well.
Gutenberg had access to oil paints developed during the
High Renaissance. From them he designed an oil-based ink
vastly superior to the water-based inks used before him. On
top of that, he constructed a special type matrix that
enabled a printer to create new fonts or special symbols
rapidly.</p>

<p>As the century of this era dawned, printing presses
popped up all over Europe. Writing and literacy expanded.
Now the fools (and the wise) had their market for writing
more than just Bibles. The Protestant Reformation shook
the world. Books and pamphlets filled with every sort of
innovation in philosophy, religion, economics and politics
found an audience and the explosion of ideas led to real
explosions as wars gripped the world. The Age of Marketing
had begun.</p>

<h3>Negligent Subcontractors (1580-1680 AD).</h3>

<h4>Woe to the land whose king was a servant</h4>

<h4>and whose princes feast in the morning. (10:16)</h4>

<p>The property may be up for sale, but the subcontractors
are still working their way through the final punch list.
Some of them cut corners to finish in time – or so they
could head to the pub for a drink.</p>

<p>This century was convulsed by the General Crisis that
swept across Europe, Asia, North and South America, and
parts of Africa. Leaders had to contend with the poor
climate of the Little Ice Age, inflationary pressure from bulk
importation of silver from the Americas, religious
controversy flowing from the Reformation and the
clamoring of the poor for freedom and justice. Emblematic
of this century was a man from the very bottom of the
aristocracy (and by income, initially below it) who rose to
command a great nation. Oliver Cromwell led the
revolution that toppled – and executed – the King of
England. That revolution did spell woe to England for
decades, as this servant who displaced their king served an
extremist agenda that nearly brought the nation to ruin.</p>

<h3>Conscientious subcontractors (1680-1780 AD).</h3>

<h4>Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth</h4>

<h4>and whose princes eat at a proper time—</h4>

<h4>for strength and not for drunkenness. (Ecclesiastes 10:17, NIV)</h4>

<p>After you fire the negligent contractors, you hope their
replacements do a better job. Many kings and queens of the
eighteenth century embraced the enlightenment. They
freed serfs, established colleges for women, protected
religious minorities, funded public health measures and
pursued other notable reforms. Among their ranks were
Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Catherine the Great of
Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia – the three great
enlightenment monarchs. Their lands truly were blessed.</p>

<h3>Roofing &amp; Maintenance (1780-1880 AD).</h3>

<h4>Through laziness, the rafters sag;</h4>

<h4>because of idle hands, the house leaks. (10:18)</h4>

<p>The house is complete, the title transferred and the
family all moved in. Now the owners are responsible for it
going forward. Will they be attentive or neglectful? The
article <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342892278_Why_Monarchy_The_Rise_and_Demise_of_a_Regime_Type">“Why Monarchy? The Rise and Demise of a Regime Type”</a>
by Gerring et al has the answer.</p>

<p>Two visuals in the article tell the story. In Europe,
starting in 1790 AD, the number of monarchies in the world
began to plummet, partially as a result of consolidation into
fewer nation states. By 1870, this wave washed over the rest
of the world. Starting in 1920 AD (in the fallout from World
War I) the number of non-monarchies surged. All these
kingdoms – these royal houses – sagged and then collapsed.</p>

<h3>Furnishing &amp; Feasting (1880-1980 AD).</h3>

<h4>A feast is made for laughter,</h4>

<h4>wine makes life merry,</h4>

<h4>and money is the answer for everything. (10:19)</h4>

<p>For the house that stands, the diligent owners enjoy a
year of ease. They fill their house with luxuries and
celebrate life. During this century the material wealth of the
world increased vastly – twenty-fold by some measures.
Sadly, it has spawned generations more convinced than
ever that <em>“money is the answer for everything”</em>.</p>

<h3>Privacy (1980-2080 AD).</h3>

<h4>Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,</h4>

<h4>or curse the rich in your bedroom,</h4>

<h4>because a bird in the sky may carry your words,</h4>

<h4>and a bird on the wing may report what you say. (10:20)</h4>

<p>As couples get older, they like to relax in the privacy of
their home among trusted friends. Privacy is what this
century is tossing aside, leading to hate, cancel culture,
unforgiveness, and violence. For us “the bird in the sky” is
a spy satellite or plane and “a bird on the wing” is a drone
or a nosy bystander with a cell phone. The surveillance
state and its private version, the social network, intrude
more each year. The “time of hate” is almost upon us, but
its tools are in place and being wielded by an emboldened
elite seeking to destroy their enemies at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>We have been warned:</strong> <br/>
<strong>the most important skills to develop during the</strong>  <br/>
<strong>coming years are diplomacy and tact.</strong></p>

<p>These tools of oppression would be destructive enough
in the hands of rational, mentally stable people in full
possession of their faculties. However, that is not the sort of
people who will inherit them. The world is going senile.
What would Orwell’s 1984 be like if Big Brother had
Alzheimer’s? We are about to see...</p>

<h3>IRS Audit.</h3>

<h4>Ship your grain across the sea;</h4>

<h5>after many days you may receive a return.</h5>

<h4>Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;</h4>

<h5>you do not know what disaster may come upon the land. (11:1-2)</h5>

<p>In the chapter “Winding the Clock”, a comprehensive analysis of this
passage and much of the rest of Ecclesiastes 11 was
presented. There the “ventures” were interpreted as
centuries (consistent with this clock). The auditor’s report
was that seven full centuries plus part of an eighth from the
past millennium would be productive, and so they were. A
few came near the start (the morning) and the rest towards
the end (the evening). As Solomon said,</p>

<h4>“Sow your seed in the <strong>morning</strong>, and at <strong>evening</strong></h4>

<h4>let your hands not be idle, for you do not know</h4>

<h4>which will succeed whether this or that, or</h4>

<h4>whether both will do equally well.” (11:6)</h4>

<p>Those eight ventures are complete. Will we earn enough
from our savings and investment to last us through
retirement? In case you were thinking of working past
retirement age, remember what Jesus said:</p>

<h4>As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me.</h4>

<h4><strong>Night is coming</strong>, when no one can work. (John 9:4)</h4>

<hr/>

<p>A skeptical reader of the above proposed solution to the riddle of Ecclesiastes 10 will likely 
zero in on the idea that the Millennial Kingdom has come and gone and the confident assertion 
that Satan was bound in 380 AD and released in 1380 AD. If this passage were the sole proof
of those ideas, it would be flimsy indeed. Between <em>Peace</em> and <em>Plague</em> I have discovered over
forty distinct prophetic clocks. They are synchronized and consistent with one another.
References to the start of the millennial kingdom and the binding and/or unbinding of Satan
exist in many Bible books, all keyed to the same periods in history. Those analyzed in detail
in my books refer to prophecies in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ecclesiastes 10</li>
<li>Matthew 18</li>
<li>Genesis 3 / Job 1-2 / Matthew 4</li>
<li>Psalm 58</li>
<li>Psalm 91</li>
<li>Proverbs 15</li>
<li>Proverbs 23</li>
<li>Proverbs 26</li>
<li>Job 26</li>
<li>Exodus 20</li>
<li>Song of Songs</li>
<li>Daniel</li>
<li>Revelation</li>
</ul>

<p>Other eschatological systems that attempt to place these events in history rely upon 
far fewer passages, often just those in Daniel, Revelation and Matthew.</p>

<p>The upshot is this. Build your house with care, for the devil is lurking out there.</p>
