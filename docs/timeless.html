<p>This article originally appeared as "Timeless?", a chapter in my book <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Ruined cities helped us sort out the lengths of the
seven church ages in a quantitative way, but
ruinous empires can only help us sort secular
political ages in a qualitative way. Empire clocks are short
on details useful for predicting time. They tell us the
number of empires, their sequence, and their nature, but
little of how long they will last. They are “timeless” clocks.
Many have written about the progression of empires
foretold by the prophet Daniel and the Apostle John. Let’s
see if we have anything new to add...</p>

<h2>A Rule for Empires</h2>

<p>A picture of the course of empires must be pieced
together from more than two Biblical books. Daniel and
Revelation form the backbone, while other books supply
details. It is like dendrochronology, the science of using
tree rings to reconstruct ancient climate. Variations in
temperature and rainfall affect the rings’ size, number, and
chemical composition. Some trees live longer than others.
Any two trees may overlap in time or not. By comparing
variations in ring thicknesses between trees, scientists
match them up and arrange the trees in chronological
order. We will do the same.</p>

<p>The Bible contains prophecies about many kingdoms.
Most are not part of the special sequence God emphasized
throughout the Bible. Near as I can tell, there is but one
master Empire Clock; any given prophecy shows a slice of
it. How do you decide if a kingdom belongs to this
sequence? Ellis Skolfield had a simple test:</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>Did the kingdom capture Jerusalem?</p>
</div>

<p>Skolfield arrived at this conclusion by studying the great
empires that marched through the Mideast, each proposed
by some scholar as potentially belonging to this menagerie
of seven “beasts”. That list has more names than can be
accounted for by the Bible. Either Scripture left some out
or some empires do not qualify. The only consistent test
Skolfield could identify was possession of Jerusalem. Of
course, even that rule had one exception.</p>

<p>Skolfield’s rule is supported (ambiguously) by these
verses from Revelation 17, the core verses that establish the
full scope of the Empire Clock.</p>

<h4>Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit</h4>

<h4>into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on</h4>

<h4>a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names</h4>

<h4>and had <strong>seven heads</strong> and <strong>ten horns</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 17:3, NIV</h6>

<h4>“This calls for a mind with wisdom.</h4>

<h4><strong>The seven heads are seven hills</strong> on which the woman sits.</h4>

<h4><strong>They are also seven kings</strong>.</h4>

<h4><strong>Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come</strong>;</h4>

<h4><strong>but when he does come, he must remain for only</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>a little while</strong>. The beast who once was, and now is not,</h4>

<h4>is an <strong>eighth king</strong>. He belongs to the seven and is going</h4>

<h4>to his destruction.</h4>

<h4>“The ten horns you saw are <strong>ten kings</strong> who have not yet</h4>

<h4>received a kingdom, but who for <strong>one hour</strong> will receive</h4>

<h4>authority as kings along with the beast.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 17:9-12, NIV</h6>

<p>These images of heads, horns and hills are the key to
assembling our chronology of empires. Like a spiritual
clock, the number seven is emphasized. The majority of the
time dominated by these empires will be apportioned to
the first seven, which appear in sequence. Those seven will
be followed by an eighth empire, then for a brief interval,
by ten more to exist in parallel. That gives us eighteen
kingdoms to identify!</p>

<p>The reference to seven hills led many commentators to
posit Rome as the beast. However, the first five empires on
the list sprang up before Rome. This is our Scriptural
evidence that Jerusalem, also built on seven hills, is the
geopolitical feature common to the empires.</p>

<h2>A Little While</h2>

<p>Before we name the empires, pay attention to the two
time references, “a little while” and “one hour”. The first is
so imprecise as to seem useless, while the second is so
short as to seem pointless. Nevertheless, we may draw
useful conclusions from each.</p>

<p>How long is “a little while”? Would the seventh be the
shortest or longest lived empire? If the shortest, would
Jesus have bothered with these words? No, he is trying to
reassure and encourage the church and Israel that though
the rule of this empire will be long, it will come to an end.
History bears this out. Let’s meet our rogue’s gallery:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Israel/Judah</strong> (1000-740, 701-597 BC). 364 years.</li>
<li><strong>Assyrian Empire</strong> - tribute (740-701 BC). 40 years.</li>
<li><strong>Babylonian Empire</strong> (597-539 BC). 58 years.</li>
<li><strong>Medo-Persian Empire</strong> (539-332 BC). 207 years.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Empires</strong>: Macedonian, Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Hasmonean (332-63 BC). 269 years.</li>
<li><strong>Roman Empire</strong> (63 BC-637 AD). 710 years.</li>
<li><strong>Islamic Empires</strong> (637-1099, 1187-1229, 1244-1967 AD). 1230 years. (Muslims controlled Jerusalem under the British mandate from 1917-1948, and East Jerusalem under Jordan from 1948 until the 1967 war.)</li>
<li>???</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s face the obvious objections.</p>

<p><strong>Egypt</strong>. The Hebrew people were slaves in Egypt, which
in its day was the largest empire in the world. Yet in those
days, Israel was not yet a nation, and Jerusalem not yet the
site of God’s temple. Furthermore, Egypt is usually named
explicitly in prophecy, not hidden behind a riddle. It does not belong on the list.</p>

<p>(Egypt does fit on a longer list of ten empires as discussed in the chapters "Job: The Course of Empires"
and "The Meaning of the Beasts of Job" from <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>.)</p>

<p><strong>Israel</strong>. Isn’t calling Israel one of Satan’s beasts anti-Semitic? United Israel remained faithful to God until
Solomon’s death. Once the kingdom split into Israel and Judah, some kings were faithful and some were not. Thus
Israel began as God’s kingdom, but progressively transformed into a beast.</p>

<p><strong>Assyria</strong>. Sennacherib’s siege of Jerusalem during
Hezekiah’s reign failed, so why does Assyria make the list?
First, the northern kingdom of Israel was permanently
destroyed by them. Second, at least three kings of Judah
paid tribute, making them vassals of Assyria.</p>

<p><strong>Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome</strong>. Few scholars
dispute the presence of these kingdoms on the list.
Daniel explicitly fingered Babylon by telling Nebuchadnezzar that
he was the head of gold on the statue in his dream. Daniel
then had prophecies related to Greece, describing smaller
empires breaking off from it, permitting us to lump all the
Hellenistic kingdoms into one beast. Finally, John was told
<em>“five have fallen, <strong>one is</strong>...</em>” “Is” means it had to have still
been around when John was alive. The empire holding
Jerusalem when John lived was Rome, which exhibited
other characteristics matching Daniel’s visions.</p>

<p><strong>Islam</strong>. As the seventh kingdom, this is where the phrase
<em>“remain for only a little while”</em> applies. After Israel lost its
freedom, each empire occupied Jerusalem longer than the
one before it. Collectively, the Islamic empires occupied
Jerusalem almost as long as all the others combined.</p>

<p><strong>The Mongol Empire</strong>. The Mongols conquered the
second largest empire in history. They destroyed the
Islamic Abbasid and Ayyubid dynasties. Their army reached
as far as Gaza, and may have sent raiding parties to
Jerusalem, but never captured it, so they are not numbered
among these beasts. Their devastation of Eastern Europe
and the Black Death that followed mere decades later
convinced many Christians that the end was near. They
were certain the Mongols were one of the kingdoms of
Revelation. Strangely enough, Kitbuqa, the Mongol general
who led the attacks on Damascus and Baghdad, was a
Christian!</p>

<p><strong>The British Empire</strong>. Britain briefly held Jerusalem
following World War I, until the rebirth of Israel. For a time,
Britain controlled the largest empire the world has ever
seen. In area, it controlled a quarter of the globe. Could it
be the eighth kingdom? Given that it lost its empire and the
world has not ended yet, no. However, it may one day be
one of the ten horns.</p>

<p>According to Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the statue
destroyed by God, the fourth empire of the statue was
Rome. This corresponds to the fifth empire of the seven in
Revelation 17. Of this part of the statue, the dream showed
<em>“its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.”</em> (Daniel 2:33) 
Daniel’s interpretation followed:</p>

<h4>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—</h4>

<h4>for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron</h4>

<h4>breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break</h4>

<h4>all the others. Just as you saw that the feet and toes were</h4>

<h4>partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a</h4>

<h4>divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength</h4>

<h4>of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.</h4>

<h4>As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this</h4>

<h4>kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</h4>

<h4>And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay,</h4>

<h4>so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united,</h4>

<h4>any more than iron mixes with clay.</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 2:40-43, NIV</h6>

<p>The two legs anticipate the Roman Empire being split
into East and West. (Rome is fourth in Daniel’s list but fifth
in John’s in Revelation. John’s list starts earlier!) The ten
toes suggest Rome would split into smaller nations which
would possess only a portion of Rome’s power. This
describes Europe perfectly. More than ten nations arose
from the ashes of the Roman Empire. In Biblical prophecy,
ten is a number of human completeness, so it need not be
exact. However, only these European nations acquired
overseas colonial empires: Portugal, Spain, France, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and
England, nine in all. Austro-Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland,
Serbia and others formed empires at one time, but were
carved out of neighboring pieces of Europe and either
lacked overseas territories or were never part of Ancient
Rome. What of the tenth? One more powerful empire was
forged from people of European descent: America.</p>

<h2>The Final Hour</h2>

<p>Will these “ten toes” of Rome reprise their roles at the
time of the end as the ten kings who receive authority for
<em>“one hour”</em>? IDK. But Daniel does:</p>

<h4>“He gave me this explanation:</h4>

<h5>‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will</h5>

<h5>appear on earth. It will be different from</h5>

<h5>all the other kingdoms and will <strong>devour the whole earth</strong>,</h5>

<h5>trampling it down and crushing it. <strong>The ten horns</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>are ten kings who will come from this kingdom</strong>...'</h5>

<h6>- Daniel 7:23-24a, NIV</h6>

<p>The only group of ten nations that ever collectively
devoured the whole earth were the European colonial
empires, which sprang from the ruins of the Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>Exactly how long is “how long”? Jesus cautioned reticence:</p>

<h4>“But about that <strong>day</strong> or <strong>hour</strong> no one knows,</h4>

<h4>not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,</h4>

<h4>but only the Father.”</h4>

<h6>- Mark 13:32, NIV</h6>

<p>Jesus said those words before John received the
Revelation. Did the Bible’s final book shed light on the day
or hour? For one, a day in prophecy may be a day, a year,
or even a thousand years. Given how confused the
chronologies were during the first millennium of the
church, being off by a thousand years was easy. The early
church believed the creation was about 5,000 BC, but by
the Reformation (thanks to Venerable Bede and Ussher),
that changed to roughly 4,000 BC. At this point, we really
are in the seventh millennium since the creation. The
church can now confidently say Christ will return less than
a millennium from today.</p>

<p>The key word is not <em>when</em>, but <em>about</em>. Jesus is not saying
we can’t know which day (millennium) he will return. He is
saying we can’t know about it. Events in that “day” will take
us by surprise. The greater uncertainty is not time, but
something else. The end times will at the same time
conform to Holy writ and defy human expectations.</p>

<p>If “day” means a thousand years, what do we make of the “hour” that
the ten horn kingdoms will reign? An hour is one twenty-fourth of a day. 
Divide a millennium by twenty-four and what do you get?</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>1,000 ÷ 24 = 41⅔ years</p>
</div>

<p>Forty-one years and eight months. Recall the numerous
prophecies of forty-two months? Now we have one that
nearly equals forty-two years. What would a forty-two year
conflict look like? One possibility is forty years of painful
struggle, followed by one climactic battle in the forty-first
year, followed by a forty-second year of victory celebrations
and peace.</p>

<p>Is the preceding scenario a reprise of the Exodus? Yes. It
describes humanity’s Exodus from God’s rule. Mankind will
throw off all restraint, persecute the church relentlessly,
and think it has defeated Christianity and its God at last.
Under a delusion, people will celebrate peace. Then Christ
will return and prove them wrong:</p>

<h4>While people are saying,</h4>

<h5>“Peace and safety,”</h5>

<h4>destruction will come on them suddenly,</h4>

<h4>as labor pains on a pregnant woman,</h4>

<h4>and they will not escape.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Thessalonians 5:3, NIV</h6>

<p>(The imagery of labor pains is our clue that <a href="./the-motherhood-pattern.html">The Motherhood Pattern</a> is in view.)</p>

<h2>Looking for Beasts Through a Wide-angle Lens</h2>

<p>What about the rest of the Bible? Look carefully and you
will see that beastly empires pop up where you least expect
them. The following list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p><strong>Job</strong>. This book introduces Behemoth ( Job 40) and
Leviathan ( Job 3, 7 &amp; 41), beasts from the land and sea,
respectively. These creatures match two beasts from
Revelation 13. One is the eighth kingdom of Revelation 17.</p>

<p>That association is well known to scholars. One I have
never seen cited in the literature is found in Job 20:</p>

<h4>Though he flees from an <strong>iron</strong> weapon,</h4>

<h5>a <strong>bronze</strong>-tipped arrow pierces him.</h5>

<h6>- Job 20:24, NIV</h6>

<p>Iron here refers to the iron kingdom, Rome, while bronze
refers to Greece. The justification for this interpretation
appears in “CSI Babylon”. What this shows is that the
metaphors of one prophet sometimes transfer over to
another.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel &amp; Revelation</strong>. Confusingly, Daniel’s visions
employ different figurative language to describe the same
empires. Medo-Persia is silver in chapter 2, a bear in
chapter 7, and a ram in chapter 8. Greece is bronze, a
leopard with four heads (because it split into four
kingdoms), and a goat. Rome is iron and a terrible beast,
while Babylon is gold and a lion.</p>

<p>In Daniel 7, the lion, bear, leopard, and terrible beast rise
from the sea, just like the beast from the sea (Leviathan) in
Revelation 13:</p>

<h4>The dragon stood on the shore of the sea.</h4>

<h4>And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.</h4>

<h4>It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns</h4>

<h4>on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.</h4>

<h4>The beast I saw resembled a <strong>leopard</strong>, but had feet</h4>

<h4>like those of a <strong>bear</strong> and a mouth like that of a <strong>lion</strong>.</h4>

<h4>The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne</h4>

<h4>and great authority.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 13:1-2, NIV</h6>

<p>This suggests that parts of the Babylonian, Medo-Persian
and Greek Empires will coalesce into a single entity. It will
likely be Islamic, as they include present day Iran, Iraq, and
and Turkey.</p>

<p><strong>Jeremiah &amp; Lamentations</strong>. Some of those animals
appear elsewhere:</p>

<h4>A <strong>lion</strong> has come out of his lair;</h4>

<h5>a destroyer of nations has set out.</h5>

<h4>He has left his place</h4>

<h5>to lay waste your land.</h5>

<h4>Your towns will lie in ruins</h4>

<h5>without inhabitant.</h5>

<h6>- Jeremiah 4:7, NIV</h6>

<h4>Therefore a <strong>lion</strong> from the forest will attack them,</h4>

<h5>a <strong>wolf</strong> from the desert will ravage them,</h5>

<h4>a <strong>leopard</strong> will lie in wait near their towns</h4>

<h5>to tear to pieces any who venture out,</h5>

<h4>for their rebellion is great</h4>

<h5>and their backslidings many.</h5>

<h6>- Jeremiah 5:6, NIV</h6>

<p>The main difference above is the substitution of a wolf for
the bear. But Jeremiah in Lamentations writes this:</p>

<h4>Like a <strong>bear</strong> lying in wait,</h4>

<h5>like a <strong>lion</strong> in hiding,</h5>

<h4>he dragged me from the path and mangled me</h4>

<h5>and left me without help.</h5>

<h4>He drew his bow</h4>

<h5>and made me the target for his <strong>arrows</strong>.</h5>

<h4>He pierced my heart</h4>

<h5>with <strong>arrows</strong> from his quiver.</h5>

<h6>- Lamentations 3:10-13</h6>

<p>The mention of arrows matches Job 20, and here the
missing bear is present, along with the lion.</p>

<p><strong>Hosea</strong>. The trio of animals makes another appearance:</p>

<h4>So I will be like a <strong>lion</strong> to them,</h4>

<h5>like a <strong>leopard</strong> I will lurk by the path.</h5>

<h4>Like a <strong>bear</strong> robbed of her cubs,</h4>

<h5>I will attack them and rip them open;</h5>

<h4>like a lion I will devour them—</h4>

<h5>a wild animal will tear them apart.</h5>

<h6>- Hosea 13:7-8</h6>

<p><strong>Isaiah</strong>. In Isaiah, we see lion, bear, leopard and wolf:</p>

<h4>The <strong>wolf</strong> will live with the <strong>lamb</strong>,</h4>

<h5>the <strong>leopard</strong> will lie down with the <strong>goat</strong>,</h5>

<h4>the calf and the <strong>lion</strong> and the yearling together;</h4>

<h5>and a little child will lead them.</h5>

<h4>The cow will feed with the <strong>bear</strong>,</h4>

<h5>their young will lie down together,</h5>

<h4>and the <strong>lion</strong> will eat straw</h4>

<h5>like the ox.</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 11:6-7</h6>

<p>Unlike all the other Scripture cited, this passage is
hopeful. It also has goats and lambs; a ram is an adult male
lamb. Thus two of Daniel’s collections of animals are
present, plus the wolf that Jeremiah used. Where does the
wolf fit in?</p>

<p><strong>Habakkuk</strong>. This prophet was informed that Babylon
would soon be on its way to destroy Israel. Again with the
animals:</p>

<h4>Their horses are swifter than <strong>leopards</strong>,</h4>

<h5>fiercer than <strong>wolves at dusk</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Their cavalry gallops headlong;</h4>

<h5>their horsemen come from afar.</h5>

<h4>They fly like an <strong>eagle</strong> swooping to devour;</h4>

<h6>- Habakkuk 1:8, NIV</h6>

<p>What’s with the eagle? Daniel described Babylon’s beast
as more than a lion:</p>

<h4>“The first was like a <strong>lion</strong>, and it had the <strong>wings of an eagle</strong>.</h4>

<h4>I watched until its <strong>wings were torn off</strong> and it was lifted</h4>

<h4>from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a</h4>

<h4>human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 7:4, NIV</h6>

<p>So Habakkuk identifies three of these four creatures,
including the wolf, but not the bear. Daniel listed four
beasts, but the fourth was not compared to an identifiable
creature:</p>

<h4>“After that, in my vision at night I looked,</h4>

<h4>and there before me was a fourth beast—</h4>

<h4>terrifying and frightening and very powerful.</h4>

<h4>It had large <strong>iron</strong> teeth; it crushed and devoured</h4>

<h4>its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</h4>

<h4>It was different from all the former beasts,</h4>

<h4>and it had <strong>ten horns</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 7:7, NIV</h6>

<p>This associates the metal iron with the fourth beast, as
well as the ten horns. What would make it terrifying? We
know that Rome lasted longer than all other empires, and
its offspring, the colonial powers, devoured the whole
earth. Is this beast the wolf?</p>

<p>Yes! The mythical tale of the founding of Rome has two
brothers, Romulus and Remus, suckled by a wolf. Thus the
several prophets, by using combinations of eagle, lion,
bear, leopard, and wolf, though never all in one place,
collectively define the full set of four beasts. It might have
been dangerous for future believers if Daniel were to call
the fourth beast a wolf; it would alert and anger Rome.
After all, he was told to “seal up” his book until the end.
Disguising Rome’s identity as the fourth beast might have
been part of that.</p>

<p><strong>Zephaniah</strong>. This prophet includes a detail that
reinforces the idea that Rome is the wolf:</p>

<h4>Her officials within her</h4>

<h5>are roaring <strong>lions</strong>;</h5>

<h4>her rulers are <strong>evening wolves</strong>,</h4>

<h5>who leave nothing for the morning.</h5>

<h6>- Zephaniah 3:3, NIV</h6>

<p>While lions normally hunt at night, they often hunt at
dawn. This passage emphasizes that the wolves hunt in the
evening. The prophecy is saying something about time.
From morning to night, beasts will attack Israel. Babylon
(the lion) was the first of the four, while Rome (the wolf )
was the last, coming in the evening.</p>

<p><strong>Ezekiel</strong>. Chapter 22 of Ezekiel references both metals
and animals. First, he tells the people they are worthless:</p>

<h4>“Son of man, the people of Israel have become dross to me;</h4>

<h4>all of them are the <strong>copper, tin, iron and lead</strong> left inside</h4>

<h4>a furnace. They are but the dross of <strong>silver</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Ezekiel 22:18, NIV</h6>

<p>Remember the progression in Daniel? Gold, silver,
bronze then iron. Here we have the silver and iron. Bronze
is an alloy of copper and tin. Lastly, lead is the metal that
alchemists tried to transmute into gold. As for the animals:</p>

<h4>There is a conspiracy of her princes within her</h4>

<h4>like a roaring <strong>lion</strong> tearing its prey; they devour people...</h4>

<h4>Her officials within her are like <strong>wolves</strong> tearing their prey;</h4>

<h4>they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain.</h4>

<h6>- Ezekiel 22:25-27, NIV</h6>

<p>Again, this prophet begins with the lion and ends with
the wolves. Note the trend. Mentions of lions, leopards and
bears are sometimes plural and sometimes singular. Wolves
are always referred to in the plural, emphasizing their
destructiveness and coordination.</p>

<p><strong>The Gospels</strong>. The Old Testament, especially parts of
Ezekiel not quoted, sometimes equates wolves with
betrayers from inside Jewish society, it’s princes, prophets
and priests, but other times external enemies. Jesus and
Paul uniformly affiliate wolves with heretics and false
believers who will destroy the church.</p>

<h4>“Watch out for false prophets.</h4>

<h4>They come to you in sheep’s clothing,</h4>

<h4>but inwardly they are ferocious <strong>wolves</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 7:15, NIV</h6>

<p>If we take all this together, then the final beasts of
Revelation come into focus. The lion, bear and leopard are
the external foes of the church, finally united. The wolves,
that terrible beast, are the empire that looks Christian but
isn’t:</p>

<h4>Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth.</h4>

<h4>It had two horns <strong>like a lamb</strong>, but it spoke like a dragon.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 13:11, NIV</h6>

<p>This beast from the earth, Behemoth, is the ultimate
example of the wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>

<p>(See “One Greater than Solomon” for an additional
historical event prophesied by Matthew 7:15.)</p>

<p>What is the point in scrutinizing two fistfuls of prophets
just so we could call Rome a wolf? It opens our eyes to a
wealth of prophetic detail that may shed light on the
meaning of difficult passages. It shouts, “Look closer!”
Some dark times in my life came when I read the Bible and
said, “So what?” I had exhausted the meaning of the words
I was reading. I needed to see something new in its pages.
New problems require new answers. These connections
open up a new dimension to chapters all over the Bible
because of human nature. When we aren’t sure if there is
treasure buried in a field, our search is cursory. When we
are sure it’s there, we leave no stone unturned. We found
the right field.</p>

<h2>Timed Trials</h2>

<p>The beginning of this chapter claimed the Empire Clock
is “timeless”; the duration of each empire was not given.
That is not entirely true. Daniel learned from Jeremiah (as
related in Daniel 9:2) that the Babylonian exile would last
seventy years. The length of the oppression of one other
beast was also given, though the calculation is tricky. Daniel
sets the conundrum up for us, and Revelation adds to the
confusion:</p>

<h4>“He gave me this explanation:</h4>

<h5>‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth.</h5>

<h5>It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will</h5>

<h5>devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.</h5>

<h5>The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom.</h5>

<h5><strong>After them another king will arise</strong>, different from the</h5>

<h5>earlier ones; <strong>he will subdue three kings</strong>. He will speak</h5>

<h5>against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try</h5>

<h5>to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will</h5>

<h5>be delivered into his hands for <strong>a time, times and half a time</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Daniel 7:23-25</h6>

<h4>The beast I saw resembled a <strong>leopard</strong>,</h4>

<h4>but had feet like those of a <strong>bear</strong></h4>

<h4>and a mouth like that of a <strong>lion</strong>...</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 13:2</h6>

<p>The first problem concerns when the fifth king will arrive
relative to the fourth beast (Rome). Some believe it comes
after the fourth beast finishes devouring the whole earth,
placing it during the future end times. However, if the
defining feature is capturing Jerusalem, this fifth king
comes after the fourth, but arrives before the fourth
kingdom finishes its devouring. That is the interpretation
chosen here.</p>

<p>The second problem is identifying the three kings this
fifth king subdued. Some assume they are the leopard, bear
and lion kingdoms of Revelation 13:2, since they also
number three. However, that chapter is about the eighth
kingdom, not the seventh. That final kingdom really does
show up at the end, and there is territorial overlap. The
eighth conquers Persia (Iran), Babylon (Iraq) and Greece (or
possibly Turkey, which annexed Constantinople, long the
center of Greek Civilization under the Eastern Roman
Empire), because those three nations are the bear, lion and
leopard.</p>

<p>Which three previous kings did the seventh king conquer,
then? Since we previously identified it as the Islamic
Empires, we know. They were Syria, Babylon and Persia,
the second, third and fourth kingdoms in the list of eight.
Note that two out of three of the kingdoms controlled by
the seventh king match those of the eighth king.</p>

<p>That leads us to the core question: how much time is a
“time”? The phrase “a time, times and half a time” (used
twice in Daniel and once in Revelation) has been taken to
mean many things. Some say it means one time plus two
more times plus a half a time, or three-and-a-half times.
They believe one “time” is one year. This 3.5 year period is
thus half of seven years. Popular Dispensational systems
teach that the Great Tribulation will last seven years, with
the second half being the worst.</p>

<p>Ellis Skolfield compared the phrase to old song lyrics:
“once, twice, three times a lady”. He said the way to read it
was “a time, a second time, and half a time”. To him, there
are only two-and-a-half times. He proposed that instead of a
year, “time” stood for a millennium. Thus the total would
be 2,500 years. He then uses this vast span of time to
connect two ancient events to two modern events. First,
from the first year of Belshazzar in 552 BC to the
reestablishment of Israel in 1948 is one block of 2,500
years. Second, from Cyrus’ edict in 533 BC permitting the
Jews to rebuild Jerusalem to the recapture of all of
Jerusalem by modern Israel in 1967 was another 2,500
years.</p>

<p>While I applaud Skolfield’s math skills, he does not
appear to have measured the same thing those verses were
measuring. Daniel 7:25 does not measure the entire time
that the Jews would be dispossessed. It only measures how
long the seventh empire will occupy Jerusalem.</p>

<p>How long was that? This is complicated, because the city
changed hands several times. The Muslims captured
Jerusalem in 637 AD. They lost it to the Crusaders in 1099
AD, regained it in 1187 AD, lost it to the Crusaders again in
1229 AD, recovered it again in 1244 AD. They held it until
World War I, when Britain captured it in 1917 AD. However,
during the British Mandatory period, while Britain
administered the mandate on behalf of the League of
Nations, de facto control over much of Jerusalem remained
in the hands of the Muslims. Active measures were taken to
prevent European Jews from emigrating there. Following
Israel’s war for independence, Jordan retained control over
East Jerusalem. Israel did not acquire full control until after
the Six Day War in 1967. All told, Islamic control lasted
1,330 years minus a century of Crusader control, for 1,230
years in all.</p>

<p>Some Old Testament prophecies use a prophetic
calendar where years have 360 days, not 365.25 days. To
get the number of prophetic years, we multiply by a scale
factor:</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>1,230 · (365.25 / 360) → 1,248</p>
</div>

<p>to get 1,248 prophetic years. How do we get that out of “a
time, times and half a time”? What if the first “time” is still
a millennia, but the “times” is two centuries? Then the
“half a time” would be a half a century. Total it up and you
get 1,000 + 200 + 50 = 1,250 prophetic years. This differs by
our historical analysis by only two years. Given some of the
above dates are not precisely known and we have rounded
to the nearest year in places instead of going down to the
actual months when events took place, the agreement
between 1,248 is as good as our accuracy permits.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that the Bible accurately
foretold how long the seventh empire would occupy
Jerusalem, to the point of accommodating times when
Jerusalem changed hands. 1,250 years is a lot longer than
3.5. Does Daniel say anything that would help us decide
between the two? Yes, he does.</p>

<h4>“This is the end of the matter.</h4>

<h4>I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts,</h4>

<h4>and <strong>my face turned pale</strong>,</h4>

<h4>but <strong>I kept the matter to myself</strong>.”</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 7:28, NIV</h6>

<p>Daniel had already endured years of captivity and
absorbed Jeremiah’s prophecy that it would last seventy in
all. Three more years of desolation would not make
Daniel’s face go pale. A dozen centuries would.</p>

<p>By your indulgence, let us make a few more calculations.
Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. This was
twelve years after 1967, or the end of 1,248 + 12 = 1,260 years
of Arab hostility. 1,260 appears twice in Revelation as is,
and elsewhere as forty-two months, since 1,260 = 42 x 30.
According to Biblical numerology, forty-two symbolizes
forty units of struggle (like the wandering in the desert
under Moses), followed one unit of battle and victory,
leading to one unit of peace.</p>

<p>Our unit is a month of years: thirty. The first 1,200 years
of Muslim rule was the forty months of years of wandering
and testing in the desert of the world. Its climax was 1917,
when Britain stripped Jerusalem from the Ottoman Empire,
and it ended with the conclusion of World War I in 1919.</p>

<p>The forty-first month ran from 1919 to 1948. This was the
month of battle. It included Arab persecution, riots and
attacks against Jews in Palestine and the Nazi’s horrific
holocaust. It culminated in Israel’s war of independence,
when they retook part of the Promised Land and became a
nation again.</p>

<p>The forty-second month, from 1949 to 1979, was not
without trouble and war, but its climax was the recapture
of Jerusalem in 1967, leading to the Camp David peace
accords with Egypt in 1978 and subsequent peace treaty
signed in 1979. Compared to millennia of suffering as exiles,
it truly was a time of peace.</p>

<p>There are people who deny that modern Israel has any
connection to the ancient kingdom destroyed long ago.
These prophecies do not lie. God kept his promise. The
journey was horrific, but God had it planned down to the
year, even down to the day. We can take comfort that God’s
sovereign will has not failed and will not fail, and that will is
eternal peace for those who love Him.</p>

<h2>Our Unvarnished History</h2>

<p>We sampled the writings of nine prophets plus Jesus to
get a handle on how pervasive the beastly empires are in
Scripture. Ideally, we would search each of the chapters
visited for deeper insight, but that would make an already
long book too heavy to lift. (This author has begun writing a
follow up book on Habakkuk, working it into this prophetic
structure.) The Bible is full of clues and they are spread
widely. The Lord told us far more about the end times than
we realize. He has also provided information to help us
understand and endure our times.</p>

<p>Colonialism, racism, white privilege, Euro-centrism,
genocide, and related hot-button issues plague our public
discourse. Statues of people once celebrated as heroes are
being toppled. How should Christians respond? Is Western
Civilization worth saving? What about all the evils done in
its name? Does the Bible hold answers?</p>

<p>Yes, but they might not be ones you like. If we accept that
America, England, and the other European colonial
empires were the feet of iron and baked clay in Daniel’s
prophecy, what are the implications? The iron is the evil
remnant of Rome, strong and cruel. The clay is true
humanity, because Adam was formed from clay. That is the
church, led by the new Adam. Those empires were partly
good and partly evil, partly Christian and partly worldly.</p>

<p>Those empires had a mission: destroy every nation.</p>

<h4>The LORD is angry with all nations;</h4>

<h5>his wrath is on all their armies.</h5>

<h4>He will totally destroy them,</h4>

<h5>he will give them over to slaughter.</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 34:2, NIV</h6>

<p>In the Old Testament, God used wicked pagan empires to
judge Israel, but after the judgment was complete, God
then destroyed those pagan empires. In like fashion, God
empowered the European nations to become great
empires, conquer the whole earth, force some civilized
behavior upon them, uproot select barbaric practices like
cannibalism, human sacrifice, and ultimately slavery, and
then He stripped them of their empires.</p>

<p>From this we learn that parts of the culture we inherited
from Europe are worth preserving and parts should be
discarded. There are people who want to rid our culture of
all Christian influence. We must oppose them forcefully.
However, we must also own up to our failings and strive to
imitate our savior better.</p>

<p>Many people will never accept that it was God’s will to
spread destruction upon the whole world. His wrath is
great against wickedness and His justice did righteously
consume many peoples, just as he will not spare Europe or
America on the day he returns. Did the Lord not determine
that Byzantium should fall? Or that the plague slaughter
over half of Europe? He continually disciplines His church.
If the church – which He loves – is so scourged, what of the
rest of the world? When those who hate Christianity
succeed in expelling it from their communities, they will
have tossed out the good clay. Then only iron will remain,
and its unyielding, totalitarian godlessness will exact
greater suffering than the church ever did.</p>
