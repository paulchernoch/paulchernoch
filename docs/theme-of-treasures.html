        <h1>Theme of Treasures</h1>
        
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-05-26</p>
        
        <p><img class="center" src="images/treasure-or-trash.png" /></p>

<p>In addition to discussing the theme of treasures in the books that constitute the Pillars of Wisdom,
this article also sums things up. It derives a few insights from all seven themes, especially why
Jesus is specially associated with two of the Spirits of God, the Spirits of Wisdom and Knowledge. </p>

<h2>Treasures</h2>

<p>Early in my Christian walk it was the desire to know
what are the treasures in Heaven that animated my search
for wisdom. My craving for such treasure was kindled by
Jesus’ words in the Sermon on the Mount. When I began to
uncover them, I learned that treasuring the things God
treasures is synonymous with worship. Doing the opposite
is idolatry. That is treasuring the impermanent or the
unclean. This connection to worship makes more sense
now that I know that the Spirit of Understanding is the
spirit of worship. This tension between true and false
worship expressed as true and false treasure is made
repeatedly in the books that constitute the Pillars of
Wisdom.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Psalms</h2>

<p>The first stop on this treasure hunt is Psalm 115.</p>

<h4>Their idols are <strong>silver</strong> and <strong>gold</strong>,</h4>

<h4>the work of human hands.</h4>

<h5>[A] They have mouths, but do not speak;</h5>

<h5>[B] eyes, but do not see.</h5>

<h5>[C] They have ears, but do not hear;</h5>

<h5>[D] noses, but do not smell.</h5>

<h5>[E] They have hands, but do not feel;</h5>

<h5>[F] feet, but do not walk;</h5>

<h5>[G] and they do not make a sound in their throat.</h5>

<h4>Those who make them become like them;</h4>

<h5>so do all who trust in them.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 115:4-8</h6>

<p>Like Ecclesiastes 12 and the words of the prophets, this
psalm lists for us the ill effects of idolatry. The idols cannot
do things like see and hear and so idol worshipers become
like the things they worship! Sometimes it is the virtues that
are compared to silver and gold, but not here. If you
consider that leprosy can cause loss of smell (and even loss
of the nose itself ), then the above lists conditions all of
which Jesus healed: the mute, the blind, the deaf, lepers,
those with withered hands and the lame. Since speaking is
twice disabled, it is likely that one is a physical disability
while the other is a mental one.</p>

<p>The LORD appears twelve times in this Psalm. Thus, this
key Psalm about treasure also points to Psalms as the Book
about "The LORD” or accepting the Spirit of Lordship. To
demonstrate our respect of His authority, we are exhorted
to trust in the LORD, fear the LORD, extol or bless the
LORD and praise the Lord.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Job</h2>

<p>Job is the pillar associated with the
spirit of Wisdom as well as the suffering of plowing. In
chapter 28, a hymn about searching for wisdom compares
that quest to the human search for precious metals and
stones. The numbering of the treasures here is added for clarity.</p>

<h4>“Surely there is a mine for <strong>(1) silver</strong>,</h4>

<h5>and a place for <strong>(2) gold</strong> that they refine.</h5>

<h4><strong>(3) Iron</strong> is taken out of the earth,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>(4) copper</strong> is smelted from the ore.</h5>

<h4>Man puts an end to darkness</h4>

<h5>and searches out to the farthest limit</h5>

<h6>the ore in gloom and deep darkness.</h6>

<h4>He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives;</h4>

<h5>they are forgotten by travelers;</h5>

<h4>they hang in the air, far away from mankind;</h4>

<h5>they swing to and fro.</h5>

<h4>As for the earth, out of it comes bread,</h4>

<h5>but underneath it is turned up as by fire.</h5>

<h4>Its stones are the place of <strong>(5) sapphires</strong> (or <em>lapis lazuli</em>),</h4>

<h5>and it has <strong>(6) dust of gold</strong>.</h5>

<h4>“That path no bird of prey knows,</h4>

<h5>and the falcon's eye has not seen it.</h5>

<h4>The proud beasts have not trodden it;</h4>

<h5>the lion has not passed over it.</h5>

<h4>“Man puts his hand to the flinty rock</h4>

<h5>and overturns mountains by the roots.</h5>

<h4>He cuts out channels in the rocks,</h4>

<h5>and his eye sees <strong>(7) every precious thing</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 28:1-10</h6>

<p>Seven precious materials are named (with the last being
the generic “every precious thing”). Gold appears twice.
The first mention of gold is in position two, which is Job’s
position in the harvest pattern and matches the Spirit of
Wisdom. Gold refined points to suffering. The second
mention of gold is in position six and matches the Spirit of
Knowledge. Together gold matches wisdom and
knowledge. This is another instance where the treasures of
Colossians are singled out, for 
<em>“in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”</em>.</p>

<p>The treasures can dazzle us so much that we miss other
details. Interspersed between references to treasures are
other images that are given in a special order: light, rope,
food, the bird of prey, the falcon, proud beasts, and the
lion. If you look closely, these images are references to Job
39-41 given in reverse order.</p>

<ul>
<li>Man “puts an end to darkness” by bringing light, which matches chapter 41 where Leviathan snorts fire and has glowing eyes</li>
<li>People “hang in the air” and “sway to and fro” by using a rope, which matches chapter 41, where a rope leash is suggested as useless to bind Leviathan</li>
<li>“the earth, out of it comes bread” matches the food offered as tribute in chapter 40 to Behemoth</li>
<li>The bird of prey matches the eagle of chapter 39</li>
<li>The falcon matches the hawk of chapter 39</li>
<li>The proud beasts match chapter 39’s menagerie of donkey, ostrich and horse</li>
<li>Lastly, the lion appears in chapter 38</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Job Rises</em>, I observed that Elihu’s speech formed a
chiasm with God’s, with the key themes given in opposite
orders. This chiasm between Job’s speech and God’s I
overlooked. It is not the themes that are reversed but
something else. It is the journey. In God’s speech, the
Almighty descends from heaven to the sky with its birds, to
the land with its beasts, then to the battlefield to face
Behemoth, who guards the gateway to the grave. Finally,
God descends to Hell to face Leviathan and bring judgment
and justice. That is God’s journey. It is not ours.</p>

<p>In his poem in Job 28, Job describes our journey, and it
is glorious. All those years spent dissecting Job and I missed
this! Job is describing the rapture of the church!</p>

<ul>
<li>What light shall “put an end to darkness”? It is the glory of Christ’s coming, for he is the Way and the Truth and the Light.</li>
<li>Who are the people who “hang in the air”? They are the blessed Christians who never die, who rise to meet the Lord in the air at the blowing of the last trumpet on the day he returns.</li>
<li>What is the bread that comes out of the earth? Those are the righteous dead who will be resurrected into glorious bodies to join the others in the air.</li>
<li>What is “it” that resides “underneath [and] is turned up as by fire” (ESV)? The NIV might be more helpful here, as it says, “transformed below as by fire”. If it said “destroyed” I would think of the judgment of Hell. Instead, this makes me think of our being purged of sin following death when “we shall be changed” as Paul says in 1 Corinthians. Whether this change is instantaneous, as many Protestants believe, or after a lengthy stay in Purgatory, as Catholics and some others do, I cannot say.</li>
<li>What of the bird of prey and the falcon? That reference is less certain, but it seems to indicate that the raptured and resurrected will fly with Christ to the battlefield to witness his great victory over the proud beasts of the earth.</li>
<li>Who then is the lion? Satan is called by Peter a prowling lion, seeking people to devour. Jesus is called the Lion of Judah. These two lions shall meet and only one walk away. That signifies Christ’s final victory and capture of the earth from Satan and his followers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Job 28 says that no one knows the way to where wisdom
may be found. Then it goes and illustrates the day when the
church finds the way and follows it to heaven. The way is Jesus.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Proverbs</h2>

<p>Comparing wisdom to treasure is a central theme in Proverbs. It is particularly strong in
Proverbs 3:13-18 and Proverbs 8:10-19. The latter passage
repeats an emphasis we have seen before, also with seven
treasures.</p>

<h4>Take my instruction instead of <strong>silver</strong>,</h4>

<h4>and knowledge rather than <strong>choice gold</strong>,</h4>

<h4>for wisdom is better than <strong>jewels</strong>,</h4>

<h4>and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.</h4>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4><strong>Riches</strong> and honor are with me,</h4>

<h4>enduring <strong>wealth</strong> and righteousness.</h4>

<h4>My fruit is better than <strong>gold, even fine gold</strong>,</h4>

<h4>and my yield than choice <strong>silver</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Proverbs 8:10-11,18-19</h6>

<p>Again, we see gold in second and sixth position. Now it
is “choice gold” and “gold, even fine gold”. Once more,
Jesus’ possession of wisdom (the second spirit) and
knowledge (the sixth) is trumpeted, just as it was in Job,
Song of Songs and Colossians. Note also that the sixth
treasure comparison speaks of “My fruit”, signifying the
harvest, the sixth phase of the Harvest Pattern.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Song of Songs</h2>

<p>Dividing the book into seven parts, each with four consecutive speeches, allows us
to match the seven spirits of God. Each section also has one
or more references to treasure.</p>

<p><strong>1:1. 1:11. 2:2. 5:1. 5:10. 6:11. 8:8.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Ornaments and a string of jewels are in 1:10. In 1:4-5, references to King and Solomon indicate <strong>Lordship</strong>.</li>
<li>In SS 1:11, earrings of gold with silver studs indicate the spirit of <strong>Wisdom</strong>. Gold emphasizes this spirit, because it is one of the two treasures associated with Jesus in Colossians 2. Myrrh in 1:13 symbolizes Christ’s suffering in this plowing phase.</li>
<li>In SS 2:3, "sit in his shade" has the Bride putting herself in a receptive position, "standing under". The reference to firstfruits (a Jewish religious festival) connects the passage to worship, hence the spirit of <strong>Understanding</strong>. This section includes verses 3:6,10, which have silver but also gold, frankincense and myrrh, the items brought by the three wise men when they went to worship baby Jesus.</li>
<li>In SS 5:1-9 there is going back and forth about being patient about love. SHE is offering her friends <strong>Counsel</strong>. Myrrh appears three times in this section, in 5:1,5. How sweet the aroma of wise counsel!</li>
<li><p>In 5:10-6:10, SHE describes the appearance of her Beloved. Giving only the precious items, there are seven:</p>

<ol>
<li>finest <strong>gold</strong></li>
<li>myrrh</li>
<li>rods of <strong>gold</strong></li>
<li>jewels (or topaz)</li>
<li>polished ivory</li>
<li>sapphires (or lapis lazuli)</li>
<li>alabaster (or marble) pillars on bases of <strong>gold</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>The Bride says of these qualities that "they overwhelm
me". SHE is overawed by his <strong>Might</strong>. The analogies to parts
of her lover’s body given in this passage are eight, but the
hair, eyes and cheeks are not matched to precious things,
but instead doves, milk, spices, and the like. The
description goes from head to toe, in a linear sequence.
The mention of raven, dove, and streams of water suggests
the flood of Noah, a time when God displayed his might.</p>

<p>Given other arrangements of treasures where gold was
used to mark the second and sixth of a series, this passage
baffled me. Also, the count of body parts and treasures
differ. Which details were significant in defining the
number and structure? Only when I reflected on another
Bible prophecy with a head of gold did I find a possible
interpretation. In Daniel is found a dream of a statue with a
head of gold, shoulders and chest of silver, belly and thighs
of bronze, and legs of iron. Each metal stood for a different
empire. The progression from most to least precious
showed a steady decline in quality from the first empire to
the last. Not so in this picture. The head is gold. The arms
are gold. The legs are gold. And the chest? Sapphire or lapis
lazuli, symbolizing God’s Law, his Word. The lover is
precious from top to bottom and inside his jeweled chest,
his heart is filled with God’s Word. So, what does this all
mean? Jesus, the eternal Word, is our treasure and he also
treasures within his own heart the same eternal Word.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>In the sixth section, 6:11-8:7, we see jewels, ivory, crowns &amp; wealth. The intimate details show that the lovers know each other. Thus, this speaks of <strong>Knowledge</strong>. In reflecting upon this section, I pondered whether there was some common feature to set off the second and six sections and so highlight wisdom and knowledge. There is. It is the crown. Song of Songs 3:11 uses the word crown three times. This reminds me of the old hymn “Crown him with many crowns”. Then this section has these marvelous words:</li>
</ol>

<h4>Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.</h4>

<h5>Your hair is like royal tapestry;</h5>

<h6>the king is held captive by its tresses.</h6>

<h6>- Song of Songs 7:5</h6>

<p>This is the Lover speaking of his Bride. What knowledge
can be greater than the Lord telling us, his church, that we
shall reign with him!</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>In 8:8 to the end, the talk is about who is entitled to
how much of the produce from the vineyard. SHE promises
not the required rent from her vineyard to her lover and
king, but her entire income (apart from the worker's share).
This demonstrates total surrender and reverence, thus 
<strong>The Fear of the Lord</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a final word on Song of Songs, I offer God my
apologies. Of all the books in the Bible, I have read this
book the least often and until this year, studied it the least.
Many people ask why it is even in the Bible. It stands apart.
As a parable and prophecy, it is the most subtle of all
works, defying the efforts of many people to find any
spiritual value besides, “You should wait to get married.” I
know enough now to conclude that I barely know anything
about its message, but at least I now know that it has a
message.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Ecclesiastes</h2>

<p>In the pages of this book, the Teacher is not content to merely decorate his poetry
with metaphors to treasures. He fairly shouts the
connection between each treasure and the seven spirits of
Wisdom.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ecclesiastes 1:1-2:11. Here Solomon demonstrates that he is in control. He is the lord of his kingdom, to the point of boasting about owning slaves, a treasure of which no one should boast. A further indication is given in this verse: <em>“I also gathered for myself <strong>silver</strong> and <strong>gold</strong> and the <strong>treasure</strong> of <strong>kings</strong> and provinces.”</em> (Ecclesiastes 2:8a) Consequently, this first section is animated by the spirit of <strong>Lordship</strong>.</li>
<li>Ecclesiastes 2:12-2:21. Solomon next turns to the spirit of Wisdom.</li>
</ol>

<h4>“So I turned to consider <strong>wisdom</strong> and madness and folly…</h4>

<h4>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair</h4>

<h4>over all the toil of my labors under the sun,</h4>

<h4>because sometimes a person who has toiled</h4>

<h4>with <strong>wisdom</strong> and <strong>knowledge</strong> and skill must leave</h4>

<h4><strong>everything</strong> to be enjoyed by someone who did not</h4>

<h4>toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</h4>

<h6>- (2:12,20-21)</h6>

<p>The first treasure mentioned here is implicit. It is the
“everything” that Solomon laments he must leave to
those who did not toil for it. Everything includes all his
material treasures. If only he esteemed the second
treasure more! Wisdom and knowledge are joined again,
marking the treasures of the second and sixth spirits as
special.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Ecclesiastes 2:22-4:6. This section is graced by the poem about the times. The words that follow that poem are about the worshipful heart, hence are animated by the spirit of <strong>Understanding</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>For to the one who pleases him God has given <strong>wisdom</strong></h4>

<h4>and <strong>knowledge</strong> and joy.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 2:26a</h6>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>He has made everything beautiful in its time.</h4>

<h4>Also, he has put <strong>eternity into man's heart</strong>,</h4>

<h4>yet so that he cannot find out what God</h4>

<h4>has done from the beginning to the end.</h4>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever;</h4>

<h4>nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it.</h4>

<h4>God has done it, so that <strong>people fear before him</strong>.</h4>

<h4>That which is, already has been;</h4>

<h4>that which is to be, already has been;</h4>

<h4>and God seeks what has been driven away.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 3:11,14-15</h6>

<p>Note that verse 2:26 speaks of “wisdom and
knowledge”. Once again, we see the pairing from
Colossians, the two treasures most closely identified
with Jesus. I would consider it pure joy to leave such
treasure to those who follow me. Verse 2:26 continues
with words about the <em>“business of gathering and collecting”</em>. 
This focuses our attention not on the
treasures themselves, but on the labor and skill that
goes into acquiring them. The section ends in 4:5 by
addressing the poison fermented within our craving for
treasure: envy.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Ecclesiastes 4:7-5:20. A summary of the fourth section would be, “Don't go it alone.” Seeing the word “advice” in verse 4:13 tells us that this is surely the spirit of <strong>Counsel</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Two are better than one...</h4>

<h5>a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</h6>

<h4>Better was a poor and wise youth</h4>

<h4>than an old and foolish king</h4>

<h4>who no longer knew how to take <strong>advice</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 4:13</h6>

<p>Solomon continues by giving advice about wealth and
riches in 5:8-20. They are about not embracing
(worshiping) money. His only positive statement about
lasting treasure is to clarify its source: God’s grace, not
our human effort.</p>

<h4>Everyone also to whom God has given</h4>

<h4><strong>wealth and possessions</strong> and power to enjoy them,</h4>

<h4>and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—</h4>

<h4>this is the gift of God.</h4>

<h6>(5:19)</h6>

<ol start="5">
<li>Ecclesiastes 6:1-8:14. The fifth section (in 6:1-2) describes the paradox of possessing but not enjoying one’s possessions. The trials deepen in chapter 7:2,4, which announces the House of Mourning. Which is worse, not enjoying what we have or losing it altogether and being forced to mourn the loss?</li>
</ol>

<p>If we suffer loss, it may because someone stronger than
us took what belongs to us, as with Job whose
possessions were carried off by bands of thieves. That
cause is addressed in this section from multiple angles.</p>

<h4>Whatever has come to be has already been named,</h4>

<h4>and it is known what man is, and that he is</h4>

<h4>not able to dispute with one stronger than he.</h4>

<h6>(6:10)</h6>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>For the protection of wisdom is like the</h4>

<h4>protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge</h4>

<h4>is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</h4>

<h6>(7:12)</h6>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than</h4>

<h4>ten rulers who are in a city.</h4>

<h6>(7:19)</h6>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>No man has power to retain the spirit,</h4>

<h4>or power over the day of death.</h4>

<h6>(8:8)</h6>

<p>What do all the above verses have in common? They are
about our need for the spirit of <strong>Might</strong>.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Ecclesiastes 8:15-9:8. In this section we come to the
spirit of <strong>Knowledge</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>For the living know that they will die,</h4>

<h5>but the dead <strong>know</strong> nothing,</h5>

<h4>and they have no more <strong>reward</strong>,</h4>

<h5>for the memory of them is forgotten.</h5>

<h6>(9:5)</h6>

<h4>...</h4>

<h4>Whatever your hand finds to do,</h4>

<h5>do it with your might,</h5>

<h4>for there is no work or thought or</h4>

<h5><strong>knowledge</strong> or <strong>wisdom</strong> in Sheol,</h5>

<h6>to which you are going.</h6>

<h6>(9:10)</h6>

<p>The pairing of wisdom and knowledge shows here as it
did in two previous sections of Ecclesiastes. Christ’s
greatest wisdom was that he knew he would die and yet
obtain a great reward, an inestimable treasure. Though
Jesus had what we lack – the power to escape death – he
knew that his death would set the world free from death
and – contrary to Solomon’s words – the memory of this
would never be forgotten. On another point Solomon
was only partly correct. There WAS no thought or
knowledge or wisdom in Sheol. That ended the day that
Christ descended into the grave and brough God’s
thoughts with him. He brought the knowledge of how to
save sinners and the wisdom to rejoice when anyone
else would mourn, for it is written:</p>

<h4>“and let us run with endurance the race that is</h4>

<h4>set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and</h4>

<h4>perfecter of our faith, <strong>who for the joy that</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>was set before him endured the cross</strong>,</h4>

<h4>despising the shame, and is seated at the</h4>

<h4>right hand of the throne of God.”</h4>

<h6>- Hebrews 12:1-2 ESV</h6>

<ol start="7">
<li>Ecclesiastes 9:9-12:14. These words speak of the end,
of when we die. Concluding as it does with the dictum,
“Fear God and keep his commandments”, this section
belongs to the spirit of <strong>the Fear of the Lord</strong>. Solomon’s
words drip with irony when he speaks about the
magical power of mankind’s greatest treasure: money.</li>
</ol>

<h4>“Bread is made for laughter,</h4>

<h5>and wine gladdens life,</h5>

<h6>and <strong>money</strong> answers everything.”</h6>

<h6>(10:19)</h6>

<p>What we treasure and what God treasures are poles
apart. God does not mourn the loss of money or its
equivalents. He shows His valuation in the last chapter:</p>

<h4>“before the <strong>silver</strong> cord is snapped,</h4>

<h5>or the <strong>golden</strong> bowl is broken…”</h5>

<h6>(12:6)</h6>

<p>The silver that is silver and the gold that is gold is the life
of His children. In Song of Songs, the Lover is compared
to gold. According to the Teacher, in such terms does
our Creator also think of us.</p>

<p>If you look for a progression in Ecclesiastes, a change in
how Solomon regards material wealth, you will find it.
He first possesses it, then fears losing it, then discovers
he lacks the grace to enjoy it or strength to hold onto it.
In the end, two things become more precious to him
than money: human life and time.</p>

<h2>Treasures in Matthew</h2>

<p>Jesus’ words in the Gospel of
Matthew were the impetus for my entire search for the
spiritual treasures. To discover the importance of the
metaphor of treasure in Matthew, I counted words like
gold, silver, money, talents, treasure, frankincense, myrrh,
riches, coin, denarius and pearl and put them in a
histogram. Then I appraised the strength and length of
passages that deal with wealth, anxiety, and goals of the
heart to find places where the importance of treasure was
underestimated by mere word counts. After that, I
summarized the counts by the harvest pattern and growth
pattern phases.</p>

<p>To interpret the results, we must decide whether the
growth pattern or the harvest pattern is dominant. This
raises the question of how to weigh the two patterns in
each of the seven pillars.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em>Psalms</em>, the overall structure is unclear. This book (<em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>) has restricted itself to critical subsets. The historical psalms encase a growth pattern but their larger structure is the harvest. Other Psalms, like Psalm 23, are solely patterned after the harvest.</li>
<li>In <em>Job</em>, the growth pattern only appears in the latter twenty-eight chapters. The whole of the book is governed by the harvest pattern.</li>
<li>In <em>Proverbs</em>, <strong>Song of Songs</strong>, and <strong>Ecclesiastes</strong> – all written by Solomon – the growth pattern is the dominant pattern structuring each book.</li>
<li><em>Matthew</em> is chaptered according to the growth pattern, yet contains at least seventeen instances of the harvest pattern, making that its major one.</li>
<li><em>Revelation</em> is subtle. The order in which I discovered the patterns in Revelation may not be decisive, but it informs my assessment. First, I spotted the seven thunders, then was able to split the book by the thunders into a harvest pattern. Only after that pattern was clear did the growth pattern come into focus. Conversely, after those discoveries, I noted that the seven signs in the Gospel of John form a chiasm with Revelation. The structure they reveal matches the growth pattern clearly but the harvest less distinctly. Taken altogether, the themes of growth and harvest are blended so well, I cannot choose a dominant one. Revelation describes the end of time, the completion of all growth and the final harvest.</li>
</ul>

<p>(NOTE: When I wrote <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, I discovered and disclosed much more of the structure of Psalms.)</p>

<p>From the above, it seems that three pillars emphasize
the harvest, three growth, and one blends them seamlessly.
Matthew, however, has the clearest focus, so to the harvest
pattern we turn. By this standard, two phases of the harvest
pattern deal with treasures more than the others: the
second (plowing) and sixth (producing). This matches the
other books, which pointed to the second and sixth spirits
of God, Wisdom and Knowledge. These link to the two
comings of Christ, as suffering servant and as conquering
Lord of the Harvest.</p>

<p>How decisive is the analysis? The sixth section has as
many mentions of treasure words (twenty-seven) as the rest
of the gospel! And the second section holds the Sermon on
the Mount, where all who search for spiritual treasure find
their first clue, to “lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven”.
Even so, every section has at least one mention of treasure,
and none are insignificant.</p>

<ol>
<li>The gifts of the Magi are an act of worship that respects the lordship of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>Christ’s temptation in the wilderness shows that material wealth and power is not the animating force in his heart. Then the Sermon on the Mount begins with the Beatitudes, where the poor in spirit and those who mourn are promised something better than riches. Jesus hits his stride by proposing to conquer anxiety not with riches, but with faith. We rightly call the heart of this message “The Golden Rule”, a gem among his teachings. The key thing to note is that all references to riches in this section concern people who don’t have them, just like Job. The poor, mournful and anxious, who fear for food, clothes and shelter, are told how to build a strong house and fill it with good things.</li>
<li>When Jesus prepared his disciples to go on their first missionary journey, he told them to leave seven treasures behind:</li>
</ol>

<h4>“Do not get any</h4>

<h5>(1) gold or</h5>

<h5>(2) silver or</h5>

<h5>(3) copper to take with you in your belts –</h5>

<h5>(4) no bag for the journey or</h5>

<h5>(5) extra shirt or</h5>

<h5>(6) sandals or a</h5>

<h5>(7) staff,</h5>

<h4>for the worker is worth his keep.</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 10:9-10</h6>

<p>The fact that the number of things to leave behind is
seven signifies total dependence upon God’s provision,
though assigning each item a spiritual meaning is
currently beyond me. Jesus is at his best as a teacher,
providing a succinct message for his disciples to share.
Their obedience shows they possess understanding,
insomuch as they are “standing under” Jesus in
obedience to his teachings and authority.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Pouring and the Spirit of Counsel</strong>. After the second and sixth sections, this one has the most references to treasure. The heart attitude of what people treasure is in focus. Jesus says in 12:11-14 that people are more important than sheep (possessions). He speaks in 12:29 of the binding of the strong man so that you can plunder his possessions. He says in 12:34-35 that, <em>“out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good <strong>treasure</strong> brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil <strong>treasure</strong> brings forth evil.”</em> The deceitfulness of riches is then associated with one of the unfruitful soils in 13:22. Next, in 13:44-46, Jesus uses the parables of the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great price to show the lengths people will go to in pursuit of their heart’s desire. With the parable of the net speaking of the final judgment, Jesus ties all of this to the <strong>counsel</strong> of the prophets, which is a warning to turn away from evil. However, in Matthew 13:53-58, many people reject Jesus’ teachings. Conspicuously, they acknowledge his wisdom (the planting phase) and his mighty works (the pruning phase) but reject him because of unbelief (the watering phase). They reject his counsel. Jesus in 13:52 “[brought] out of his <strong>treasure</strong> what is new and what is old.” The old was okay; they could not accept the new. This section ends with a dark sentence: <em>“And he did not do many <strong>mighty</strong> works there, because of their unbelief.”</em> (Matthew 13:58) The key word is “mighty”, because the spirit of Might awaits the next section.</li>
<li><strong>Plucking and the Spirit of Might</strong>. This section has two parables concerning treasure, the search for a lost sheep and the parable of the unforgiving servant. If being locked up in prison until you pay your debts is not a picture of God exercising his <strong>might</strong> in pursuit of discipline, nothing is.</li>
<li><p><strong>Producing and the Spirit of Knowledge</strong>. In ten stories drawn from Matthew 19-25, whether parables, woes, or other forms, Jesus addresses our use and misuse of treasure. The spirit of Knowledge gets down to the implementation details of life, so these stories address many facets of how our attitude toward money and possessions corrupts our judgment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rich young ruler</strong>. Material treasure becomes spiritual
treasure when we give it to the poor. It is better to lack
money than to lack generosity.</li>
<li><strong>Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard</strong>. How much is my
labor worth?</li>
<li><strong>Cleansing the Temple</strong>. Prayer is of greater value than the
coin of the money changers.</li>
<li><strong>Parable of the Murderous Tenants</strong>. The tenants valued
their plot of land and its crops more than the life of the
master and his son.</li>
<li><strong>Paying taxes to Caesar</strong>. In our minds there is a conflict
between our financial obligations to God and to country.
We can use what we view as an insoluble problem as an
excuse to neglect one or the other duty. Jesus can lead us
to the proper resolution of this tension.</li>
<li><strong>A Woe concerning oaths</strong>. Oaths to God involving money
were viewed as more important than other types of
oaths. “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, If anyone
swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears
by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.”
(Matthew 23:16 ESV) That means that money was viewed
as more important, too.</li>
<li><strong>The Faithful and Wise Servant</strong>. Wicked servants mistreat
those put under their charge. Faithful servants show
mercy and fairness in how they manage God’s people
and liberally provide food and other resources to sustain
them. Merciful stewardship is more to be prized than the
privileges of leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Parable of the Ten Virgins</strong>. The five foolish virgins are
urged to rush to the merchants to purchase oil but do not
make it back to the wedding in time. Their money – their
material treasure – cannot gain them admittance to the
wedding celebration. It seems that the real treasure was
time, and theirs ran out.</li>
<li><strong>Parable of the Talents</strong>. For excuses, the unprofitable servant cited fear and charged the master with unfairness. Thus, he lacked two more treasures: courage and faith.</li>
<li><strong>Prophecy of the Sheep and Goats</strong>. In the final tale, people are judged on whether they use their treasure to help the poor, the sick, the oppressed, and the prisoners. Mercy is the final treasure to be lauded here. We show that we possess that mercy when we make our neighbors our treasures, thus fulfilling the Golden Rule.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Giving, working, praying, religious vows, loyalty,
authority, stewardship, preparedness, mercy…
money touches on every aspect of our religion.
These stories tie Matthew to the other pillars. For
example, the Rich Young Ruler could have gotten the
same advice from Proverbs: </p>

<h4>“Whoever gives to the poor will not want,</h4>

<h4>but he who hides his eyes will get  many a curse.”</h4>

<h6>- Proverbs 28:27 (ESV)</h6>

<p>As for making wise oaths, the Scribes and Pharisees could have
benefitted from Ecclesiastes 5. Don’t forget the
foolish virgins, either. They should have imitated the
industriousness of the “daughters of Jerusalem” who
helped prepare the palanquin and other wedding
decorations in Song of Songs. Lastly, any modern
unprofitable servants can read Revelation to see the
glorious reward in store for all who believe. Our
master is not fair – he is generous, giving us more
than we ask for or can imagine.</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>There are only three treasures in this final section: the temple silver, the money paid to the tomb guards, and one other. What was Judas’ treasure? Thirty pieces of silver for a betrayal. What did that same silver become to the temple officials after Judas discarded it? Their greed made them experts at money laundering, converting blood money into real estate and treachery into charity. The guards took a bribe to lie that they were outsmarted by body snatchers. Disloyalty, greed, jealousy, power and deception. Tarnished silver and hush money are humanity’s treasure. The real treasure was the body and blood of Jesus, our souls’ ransom. Sadly, the spirit of the Fear of the Lord is not found in these acts. Judas became afraid, but instead of repenting, took his own life. The Jewish leaders were afraid, but of Rome, not the Father, so they surrendered Caesar’s rival. The soldiers were afraid of being executed by men, not cast into Hell by God. Jesus, however, filled with holy fear, lay down his life in obedience. This sacrifice by a suffering servant finds its closest analog among all the Pillars of Wisdom in the sufferings of Job and the account of Leviathan in Job 41. That connection binds the second pillar to the sixth more than all the whispers found in patterns previously described involving gold or crowns.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Treasures in Revelation</h2>

<p>We come now to the last of the clues that identify the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
Revelation is too full of treasure to perform a complete
analysis here. We shall focus on the sections with the least,
most, and last mentions of treasure. As before, Revelation
is divided into pieces by thunder.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Least</strong>: Section 2, Chapters 6 &amp; 7, spirit of Wisdom. Like the other pillars of wisdom, the second section stands apart as special, having the fewest mentions of treasure. Recall how Job corresponds to the second spirit of Wisdom and represents plowing, mourning, persecution and loss. Also recall how the second section of Matthew speaks to the poor in spirit, the mournful, the persecuted and people anxious for food and clothes. This section shares the same spirit. Chapter seven has no references to treasure; it has the Great Tribulation. Chapter six has only three references to treasure, but in each case negates that treasure by lamenting its scarcity. <em>“And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, 'A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!' ”</em> (Revelation 6:6 ESV) This chapter speaks of scarcity, not plenty. It also speaks of persecution (6:9-11). The only mention of the rich is to describe how they go into hiding (in 6:15).</li>
<li><strong>The Most</strong>: Section 6, Chapters 16-18, spirit of Knowledge. Knowledge is about knowing the details of how complex systems function and are maintained. Here the economic system is in view:</li>
</ul>

<h4>lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone,</h4>

<h4>and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk,</h4>

<h4>and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and every vessel of ivory,</h4>

<h4>and every vessel of most precious wood,</h4>

<h4>and brass, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon,</h4>

<h4>and odours, and ointment, and frankincense,</h4>

<h4>and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat,</h4>

<h4>and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots,</h4>

<h4>and of <strong>bodies and souls of men</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 18:12-13, YLT</h6>

<p>A wise person said in Proverbs something that ties
together the second and sixth spirits:</p>

<h4>Two things I ask of you;</h4>

<h5>deny them not to me before I die:</h5>

<h4>Remove far from me falsehood and lying;</h4>

<h5>give me neither poverty nor riches;</h5>

<h4>feed me with the food that is needful for me,</h4>

<h5>lest I be full and deny you and say,</h5>

<h6>“Who is the LORD?”</h6>

<h4>or lest I be poor and steal and</h4>

<h5>profane the name of my God.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 30:7-9</h6>

<p>The spirit of wisdom is what we need to master poverty.</p>

<p>The spirit of knowledge is what we need to master riches – and not be mastered by them.</p>

<p>Jesus mastered poverty during his first coming. When he returns, he shall distribute 
all the wealth of heaven to his children.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Last</strong>: Section 7, Chapter 19-22, spirit of the Fear of the Lord. The last section of Revelation has the second greatest number of references to treasure, though none are found in chapter twenty (about judgment) or twenty-two. The beauty of the new Jerusalem is described in terms of precious gems and gold, but it is the treasure-free chapter twenty-two that has the best word of all:</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!”</h4>

<h4>And let the one who hears say,</h4>

<h5>“Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come;</h5>

<h5>and let the one who wishes take the</h5>

<h5><strong>free gift of the water of life</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 22:17, NIV</h6>

<p>Free! The water of life is free! That is the end to all
treasure, because all will be treasured, all free, and all
need for comparison, for calculation, for acquiring,
saving, and spending will be gone.</p>

<p>Isaiah put it best.</p>

<h4>O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted,</h4>

<h5>behold, I will set your stones in antimony,</h5>

<h6>and lay your foundations with sapphires.</h6>

<h4>I will make your pinnacles of agate,</h4>

<h5>your gates of carbuncles,</h5>

<h6>and all your wall of precious stones.</h6>

<h4>All your children shall be taught by the LORD,</h4>

<h5>and great shall be the peace of your children.</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 54:11-13 ESV</h6>

<p>The prophet lists seven treasures, but the two most
precious are the two he lists last: children and peace. With
all that we have seen, it is finally possible to identify the
seven treasures in Job 28, if we draw on several of the
pillars, thus tying them all together:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silver</strong> is <em>the Lord</em>, because Jesus our Lord was sold for thirty pieces of silver in Matthew.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong> is <em>Wisdom</em>, because the Lover in Song of Songs is described as gold, from head to toe, and Daniel in his prophecies links the head of gold to wisdom. <em>“How much better to get wisdom than gold!”</em> (Proverbs 16:16a)</li>
<li><strong>Iron</strong> is <em>Understanding</em>, because it was the Iron empire, Rome, that God placed under the control of his church. And in Proverbs we have this gem: “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.” (Proverbs 27:17 ESV) Many times in Revelation, Psalms and other places is iron associated with forced submission, because the wicked refuse the voluntary worship that flows from understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Copper</strong> is <em>Counsel</em>, because of Solomon’s bronze pillars, Jachin and Boaz, and his authorship of Proverbs, which names and numbers the Pillars of Wisdom. (Bronze is copper alloyed with tin.)</li>
<li><strong>Lapis Lazuli</strong> is <em>Might</em>, because it was Issachar's stone, and Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds (Genesis 49:14). Also, the Ten Commandments may have been carved in Lapis Lazuli, God's mighty throne rests upon lapis lazuli, and Isaiah 54:11-13 says that the foundations of the new Jerusalem will be made from this stone. The chest is also the part of the body associated with strength with all its muscles and the heart that beats there, and in Song of Songs, the chest of the Lover is described as decorated with Lapis Lazuli.</li>
<li><strong>Gold dust</strong> is <em>Knowledge</em>, for Job 22:22-25 and Isaiah 54 treasure 6 compare gold to being “taught by the Lord”. As for Proverbs, it says, <em>“Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.”</em> (Proverbs 8:10 ESV)</li>
<li><strong>All its treasures / Every precious treasure</strong>. This must match <em>the Fear of the Lord</em>, because the end of Revelation has the most glorious listing of treasure and Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms and all the prophets agree that the Fear of the Lord is the primary cause that leads to every good thing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>So What?</h2>

<p>That is all. The Seven Pillars of Wisdom have been
named, interconnections followed, and their separate
purposes explained. As parts they have been arranged into
a harmonious whole: the harvest pattern. <strong>So what?</strong> When I
was a management consultant, they drilled that two-word
question into us. By the end of every business proposal,
email, or slide deck you must answer that question. Why
did you waste my time? How does this help me further my
goals?</p>

<p>This is not a management consulting proposal. It is a
reflection on wisdom. My advice is to begin processing the
information presented here the same way I began in 1987,
the year before the one I devoted to studying the books of
wisdom. I was taking a class on the Bible at MIT taught by
an atheist. For my final paper, I was to compare and
contrast the gospels of Matthew and John. My only
technique was to read each gospel multiple times until the
differences surfaced in my mind. I didn’t know it at the
time, but that was my introduction to the Pillars of
Wisdom. I believe that those days of meditating on Matthew
and John deepened the thirst for wisdom already present in
my soul. That thirst caused me to turn to the books of
wisdom the following year.</p>

<p>Thus in 1988, I read Proverbs over and over for six
months, before branching to the other wisdom books for
the remainder of the year. At first, I struggled to
understand the meaning of many of the Proverbs. Then I
lamented how I was not living in accord with those
instructions. I tried to act wise, but often failed. Had I
stopped there, I would have failed at everything. Instead, I
made Proverbs into my prayer journal. I asked the Lord to
make me into the kind of person described in its pages. Had
I stopped there, it would have been beneficial, but the Holy
Spirit was generous. Many people turn to the Psalms when
they want to worship God; I learned to worship God from
the pages of Proverbs. Surely the only good and wise and
generous and courageous person whose character and
conduct completely match that described in Proverbs is
Jesus. By meditating on those words, I was meditating on
Jesus. Do likewise. My time in Proverbs deepened my
worship of God immeasurably.</p>

<p>This suggests important questions. Why did my time of
learning so much about the wisdom books align with God’s
desire to reveal so many mysteries that had remained
hidden for millennia?</p>

<h2>Questions about God’s Time</h2>

<p>A careful, studious, critical Berean Christian has the
right and obligation to ask for a Biblical justification that
God not only hid such mysteries for so long but intended to
reveal them now. In all the years it took to prepare this
volume, I never uttered this question out loud because I
lacked the answer. A writer should never pose a vital
question in their book that they cannot answer. Months
after my initial online publication of this book, nagging
questions remained, some addressed in this appendix.
When I had all seven categories of clues laid out before me,
I tried to discern how to summarize my findings. What
critical questions can they answer?</p>

<p><strong>Did the Bible prophesy when the parables about time in Ecclesiastes would be unsealed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you avoid the implication of Jesus’ denial of knowledge in Matthew?</strong> 
<em>“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.”</em> (Matthew 24:36 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>What purpose was served by marking the second and sixth treasures as belonging specially to Jesus?</strong></p>

<p>As narrow as the third question seems, that one led to
answers for the other two. Throughout this book, Jesus has
been associated with the number two, the Father with the
number three, and the Holy Spirit with the number seven.
So, Jesus is assigned the second and sixth treasures to point
to the second and sixth pillars – Job and Matthew. This
makes sense because Job is about the suffering servant, the
plan of salvation and the savior’s eventual suffering on the
cross, while Matthew is a gospel, hence explicitly devoted
to Jesus.</p>

<p>What pillars belong to the Father? The logical answer is
that the third, fourth and fifth pillars belong to the Father:
Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. All three were
written by Solomon (with some assistance by Hezekiah and
others). Solomon’s tone was that of a father teaching his
son. His natural son did not become wise, but Jesus, his
spiritual son, practiced all that wise Solomon had to teach.
Also, those three pillars are the ones whose primary
structure is the Growth Pattern of twenty-eight times, not
the Harvest Pattern. They fit together.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit infuses all seven pillars. By process of
elimination, though, it has a special connection to Psalms
and Revelation. Psalms connects the heart to worship while
Revelation is the place that numbers the Seven Spirits of
God.</p>

<p>This trinitarian division of the pillars gives us a partial
answer to the second question. Jesus said that the timing of
his return and of many other events prophesied in
scripture is known only to the Father. If the books of
Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are pillars devoted
to the Father and they are prophetic, what shall we
conclude? This part of the Bible contains a detailed
schedule of events. The Father’s pillars contain the Father’s
wisdom concerning time. That wisdom is encoded, sealed
off from our understanding until the proper time. This is
how Jesus can be correct about not knowing the timing of
certain events, yet that timing is still present in Scripture,
awaiting a day when those words shall be unsealed for us to
understand. Jesus says that only the Father knows and the
Bible contains parts that speak in the Father’s voice.</p>

<p>That brings us to the first question. Have we reached
that proper time? Is this the season in which God the
Father begins to unlock the temporal mysteries hidden in
His Word? If so, has He predicted this unveiling in His
Word?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>The chapter “Swords, Seals and Surviving to Saturday” in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>
dug into the opening of the seven seals of the Lamb’s scroll. The
emphasis was on the nature of each seal – what obstacle
was removed – and on matching the actual historical events
that followed that opening to the riddles given in
Revelation. With all that focus on action, we missed part of
the message. After all, it was a scroll being unsealed. What
was written on that scroll?</p>

<p>Matching the seven seals to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
gives the answer. With the breaking of each seal on the
scroll, another part of the Bible was also unsealed. Words
that the church had either misunderstood or been
completely baffled by were clarified. It is these words that
propel the church forward amid the chaos spoken of in
Revelation’s curses. Here is that concordance.</p>

<p><strong>First Seal</strong>: <em>And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a <strong>bow</strong>, and a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.</em> (Revelation 6:2, ESV)</p>

<p><strong>First Pillar</strong>: <strong>Psalms</strong>. There are nine references to
“bows” in Psalms, more than any other Bible book. Two
are in Psalm 78, the first historical Psalm, which
announces a great riddle. </p>

<h4>“I will open my mouth in a parable;</h4>

<h4>I will utter dark sayings from of old,</h4>

<h4>things that we have heard and known,</h4>

<h4>that our fathers have told us.”</h4>

<h6>- Psalms 78:2-3 ESV</h6>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: What was unsealed was the Bible itself. A
bow is a means of firing projectiles long distances. By
his new printing press, Gutenberg began the mass
production of God’s Word and fired its flaming arrows
into the world as never before. Psalm 119, longest
chapter in the Bible, extols God’s Word and urges all
people to study it daily. At last, this possibility became a
reality for great numbers of people.</p>

<p><strong>Second Seal</strong>: <em>And out came another horse, bright red. Its rider was permitted to <strong>take peace from the earth</strong>, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a <strong>great sword</strong>.</em> (Revelation 6:4 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Second Pillar: Job</strong>. Among the seven pillars, only
Psalms has more references to swords than Job.
Crucially, the core of the book is a heated debate among
religious people, with the three friends ganging up on
poor Job. Major revelations in Job include salvation by
grace through faith and the sovereignty of God.</p>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: The opening of this seal prompted the
Protestant Reformation and led to the wars of religion
and the General Crisis. Religious people fought each
other, just as in Job, except with rifles, cannon and
cavalry. John Calvin preached over 150 sermons on Job
and appealed to the view of God’s sovereignty in Job for
his defense of predestination and the assurance of
salvation. The true sword was the word of God.</p>

<p><strong>Third Seal</strong>: <em>And I looked, and behold, a black horse! And its rider had <strong>a pair of scales</strong> in his hand. And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!”</em> - Revelation 6:5b-6 ESV</p>

<p><strong>Third Pillar: Proverbs</strong>. This pillar has three mentions
of scales used for weighing things (as opposed to fish
scales). This is the most mentions of scales of any pillar.
Proverbs has a lot to say about honesty and integrity in
business dealings.</p>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: The industrial revolution, anti-slavery and
labor movements redefined the world of work. Reforms
in the justice systems (often symbolized by Lady Justice
holding a pair of scales) of many countries also
occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth Seal</strong>: <em>When he opened the <strong>fourth seal</strong>, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider's name was <strong>Death</strong>, and <strong>Hades</strong> followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.</em> (Revelation 6:7-8 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Fourth Pillar: Song of Songs</strong>. If any pillar seemed
likely to break the pattern and invalidate this argument
identifying pillars with seals, it was this love poem.
Instead, it has the most profound connection of all.</p>

<h4>Set me as a <strong>seal</strong> upon your heart,</h4>

<h5>as a <strong>seal</strong> upon your arm,</h5>

<h4>for love is strong as death,</h4>

<h5>jealousy is fierce as <strong>the grave</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Its flashes are flashes of fire,</h4>

<h5>the very flame of the LORD.</h5>

<h6>- Song of Songs 8:6 ESV</h6>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: The divine sense of irony is on full display, as
Solomon’s “time to love” coincided with the unleashing
of the evils of Nazism, communism, and other beastly,
authoritarian regimes that killed with sword, famine
and pestilence as predicted. The flashes of fire in
Solomon’s poem match the fires of modern warfare.
God poured out His love on mankind, while we poured
out our hate on each other. Twice does this passage in
Song of Songs speak of a seal. The Lord did not want to
leave room for doubt that the unveiling of this book and
the opening of this seal were one. Revelation warns of
Death and Hades; the poem triumphantly declares that
God’s love shall overcome death and God’s jealousy will
not allow us to be imprisoned in the grave. The breaking
of this seal upended ideas of marriage, romance,
sexuality and love. The chasm between peoples grows
as the wicked get fouler while the righteous grow purer.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth Seal</strong>: <em>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne. They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, <strong>how long</strong> before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” Then they were each given <strong>a white robe</strong> and <strong>told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete</strong>, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.</em> (Revelation 6:9-11 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Fifth Pillar: Ecclesiastes</strong>. <em>Let your garments be always white. Let not oil be lacking on your head</em>. (Ecclesiastes 9:8 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: The breaking of the first four seals upended
government, religion, economics and family. The fifth
ushers in Solomon’s “time to hate”, a great persecution.
We live in anticipation of this calamitous event. Cracks
in our social structure widen daily. People who strive to
lead holy lives and keep their garments white will come
under assault. The words of Revelation speak of time.
The martyrs plead, “How long?” All they are told is,
“Longer.” What is unsealed is a part of God’s plan for
time. This book considers Ecclesiastes and the other
Pillars of Wisdom to conform to a detailed temporal
structure. The breaking of the fifth seal will permit some
in the church who have faith to understand much more
about the Father’s prophecies about the end than any
previous generations. This knowledge will permit the
church to survive unimaginable hardship. This
knowledge will keep alive some who would otherwise
die.</p>

<p><strong>Sixth Seal</strong>: <em>When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a <strong>great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood, and the stars of the sky fell to the earth</strong> as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale. The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”</em> (Revelation 6:12-17 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Sixth Pillar: Matthew</strong>. Chapter 24 of Matthew speaks
of earthquakes in verse 7, says <em>“the love of many will grow cold”</em> in verse 12 signifying the <em>“time to hate”</em> and
<em>“time for war”</em>, and says <em>“the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven”</em> in verse 29. There is no disputing that the times
predicted by Matthew 24 and the events surrounding
the breaking of the sixth seal are the same.</p>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: What will the church learn when the hidden
wisdom from Matthew’s pillar is finally unsealed? We
cannot know, as those truths have not yet been
unsealed. Based on the greater number of words used to
describe the event, it will be earth-shattering. However,
note that chapter 24 is where Jesus says, 
<em>“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.”</em> 
Based on this, I believe that more detailed instructions about God’s
timing will be revealed to the church in that day. Also,
Jesus’ second treasure is knowledge. The church will be
given spiritual knowledge of a nature and a depth never
before experienced, preparing the remnant to perform
miracles as Revelation elsewhere describes.</p>

<p>The most troubling words in the passage from
Revelation are not the terrifying calamities but the
words “the sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled
up”. If the unsealing of God’s Word enables the church
to understand the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, what
happens when a scroll is rolled up? This is the act of
people who have an unsealed scroll that they could
read, but they choose not to. By their own volition the
inhabitants of the earth push aside the Bible and
distance themselves from its wisdom and teachings
even more than they do today. Their spiritual blindness
will become complete.</p>

<p><strong>Seventh Seal</strong>: <em>When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was <strong>silence</strong> in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</em> (Revelation 8:1-2 ESV)</p>

<p><strong>Seventh Pillar: Revelation</strong>. Revelation is divided into
sections according to the seven thunders, yet this
passage about the opening of the seventh seal speaks of
silence first, trumpets second. What does that mean?</p>

<p><strong>Unsealed</strong>: The NIV says in 1 Corinthians 14:8, 
<em>“Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?”</em> 
Elsewhere in Scripture, people chosen by
God to hear Him speak understand His words, while
bystanders hear only thunder. Revelation 10 says to seal
up what the seven thunders spoke. If a time of thunder
is followed by silence, then by the clear strains of the
trumpet, this signals a change. God’s communication to
some in the church will become crystal clear. The voice
of the seven thunders will finally be revealed in its
fullness. It will be a call to battle and the church will be
led by its commander.</p>

<p>With the opening of each seal a corresponding pillar is
also elucidated. I shall reiterate: the opening of the fifth seal
and its attendant persecutions shall usher in the time of
hate. To prepare the church for this, it needs new
knowledge so that it may survive and continue the work
God gave it to do. This is not a new thing. Four times in the
last six hundred years has God done something like this,
each different in character. The character of Ecclesiastes
and the mysteries surrounding the fifth seal are the same:
both are concerned with God’s sovereign control over time.
God’s plan for history will become clearer to the church as
many parables, riddles and prophecies are solved and fit
together into a coherent picture. To the inhabitants of the
earth, time will spin out of control. To the elect, time will
reach its fulfillment and the church will attain full maturity.</p>

<h2>Advice about Your Time</h2>

<p>Now it is your time to incorporate God’s wisdom into
your life. Turn the ideas in this book and the insights into
the Scriptures that they provide into seeds for prayer,
meditation and worship. Then the Holy Spirit will guide
you into what application you should make of the many
principles that have been uncovered. The Spirit will help
you order your approach to meet your peculiar needs,
strengths and weaknesses. I searched as a blind man, not
knowing what I would find. You may search by the dim
light of my words. I did not know all the pieces, how they
work together, and how God has ordered all things
carefully. It all looked like a bunch of random aphorisms
with no overarching structure. That is not the case!
Knowing the patterns, you may more swiftly direct your
attention to areas of weakness and confusion in your heart
and match them to the Bible passages that can bring clarity
and peace. Knowing the patterns, you can reap a harvest.</p>

<p>May your harvest be bountiful. Prepare your life-song
to add a new praise of the Lord to the Psalms. Like Job,
comfort others with the comfort you have received. Frame
a proverbial riddle to plant delight in the hearts of all lovers
of God’s word. Pour fragrant myrrh upon thirsty hearts
waiting for their own love song to begin. Turn vanity to
solemn purpose as a teacher of children. Then walk the
fields with a tax collector in the furrow to your left and the
Lord of the Harvest in the furrow to your right and reap a
bumper crop. And when it is time to collect your wages,
you won’t need them. To satisfy your thirst, you shall take
<em>the free gift of the water of life</em> now revealed before your
joyful eyes.</p>

<p>Grace and Peace to you, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
