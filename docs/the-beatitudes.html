<h2>Admitting that You Need Help</h2>

<p>Decades ago I was sitting in a seminar related to my job. It had something to do with self-improvement and was based on ideas taken from psychology. The goal may have been to foster stronger teams in the workplace but the focus was on individual effort and advancement. Minutes before, the facilitator put up a slide on the projector with the neat and tidy steps that would get you to the goal. I had no background in this area, had taken no classes in psychology and human development and do not recall having read books related to the subject. All I had was an analytical mind and no sense of boundaries or the following of social norms, courtesy of my as yet undiagnosed Asperger’s. Give me a list and I will do four things. First, I will count it. Second, I will decide if any of the items are wrong or do not belong. Third, I will decide if any of them are out of sequence. Fourth and most difficult, I will search for holes. Are any steps in the process missing?</p>

<p>Before the lecturer had a chance to finish summarizing these ideas which were the outline of the entire seminar, ideas which I had never seen before, I raised my hand and said, “You’re missing a step.” The man was a bit dumb-founded but humored me by asking what that step might be. I said, “The first step is that you have to want to change.”</p>

<p>Isn’t that what repentance is? It is recognizing that you need to go in a new direction and to do that you need to change. Going beyond psychology, that recognition must be coupled with an admission that you cannot make those changes by yourself. You need God. No human program of self-improvement will succeed. You must admit you are poor and turn in faith to the God who is rich in forgiveness and grace. The lecturer in my seminar (and the authors of the course who stood behind him) missed that crucial first step. In Matthew 5-7 we get to listen in on a different seminar, taught by someone who did not miss. And yes, Jesus put that first step first. We call that first step of realizing that you have needs that only God can meet the Beatitudes.</p>

<p>These are the first seven Beatitudes:</p>

<h4>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</h4>

<h5>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are those who mourn,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be comforted.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the meek,</h4>

<h5>for they shall inherit the earth.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be satisfied.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the merciful,</h4>

<h4>for they shall receive mercy.</h4>

<h4>Blessed are the pure in heart,</h4>

<h5>for they shall see God.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the peacemakers,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be called sons of God.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:3-9, ESV</h6>

<p>It is curious that in the first four Beatitudes, the one to be blessed is described as deficient in something desirable which the Lord promises they will one day receive. They are poor, mournful, meek, hungry and thirsty. In the last three, the blessed one possesses an admirable character quality but is promised something even greater. This indicates that the person is on a quest and they are making progress toward maturity.</p>

<p>That quest is to reap a spiritual harvest and the crop is named in the sixth blessing. The goal of that harvest is the impossible desire that drove Moses on: to see the face of God and live.</p>

<p>Each blessing matches its corresponding phase in the <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>. 
Collectively, these seven constitute the heart that a determined harvester must have if they are to fulfill Jesus’ command 
to make disciples of all nations. Before we see how this all fits together, there is a longer process of salvation at work: the path to glory.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ordo Salutis</em>: Nine steps from Dishonor to Glory</h2>

<p>Every denomination has its own way to describe the process of salvation, with much overlap.
The order presented here is closest to that taught by Reformed churches; in my list two Reformed steps are omitted (Predestination and Election)
and one step (Adoption) is shifted by one position. The sequences presented by all denominations are the product of complex theological systems. 
To my knowledge, none of these systems offer up a single Bible passage in which this order may be observed.
Instead, they have composed it by drawing upon passages scattered throughout the Bible, applying logic and also factoring in key insights from
their denominational system. In this article, an <em>Ordo Salutis</em> will be described and defended from but two passages: 
Psalm 19 and Matthew 5:3-11. </p>

<p>Why is this significant? You don't need a fancy system based on human logic and many assumptions
to derive the plan of salvation. You only need the words of Jesus. Also, these are not just any words.
Before delivering the Beatitudes, Jesus in Matthew has only uttered six sentences. One was to insist that John baptize him.
Three were addressed to the devil during his temptation. One was to call people to repent. The sixth one was to call Simon and Andrew to be his disciples.
Thus these Beatitudes are Jesus' first major teaching. Isn't it fitting that they tell people, step by step, the way to be saved?</p>

<p>Both Psalm 19 and Matthew 5 list all nine steps. The only difference between these two passages is that
Adoption falls between Perseverance and Glorification in Psalm 19 and between Sanctification and Perseverance in Matthew 5.
Since the reference to Adoption in Psalm 19 is subtle and appears in the same verse as the references to perseverance and glory,
the clear and unambiguous listing of Matthew will be considered definitive. Here is that order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calling</li>
<li>Regeneration</li>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Repentance</li>
<li>Justification</li>
<li>Sanctification</li>
<li>Adoption</li>
<li>Perseverance</li>
<li>Glorification</li>
</ol>

<p>By combining Psalm 19 and Matthew 5, we will see that the Bible tells a simple story. 
King David prayed in Psalm 19 for the Lord to save him.
Then Jesus answered in the Beatitudes by telling us the way of salvation.</p>

<p>The Bible also tells a more complicated story. The world as nations and peoples and a suffering church
has also cried out for someone to show them the way of salvation on a larger scale than just individuals. 
Jesus has told us how he will save that part of the world that turns to him in faith. 
The Beatitudes prophesy ten eras in the history of the church. Each Beatitude shouts the cry for help of one era 
in church history. The blessing in that Beatitude names the relief that the Lord promised to send in the following era.
The ninth and final beatitude prophesies a blessed tenth time when there will be no more suffering, and that will be when Jesus returns.</p>

<p>As for David, his very prayer was a prophecy that can be used to identify the one who would answer it.
Before we get to that, though, let's perform some accounting.</p>

<h2>Numbering the Beatitudes</h2>

<p>To emphasize the cooperation yet distinct roles of the persons of the Trinity, many Bible passages are phrased so as to highlight the numbers
that correspond to each person, or the Law, or some other concept. The Beatitudes of Matthew 5 are so structured.</p>

<p><strong>The Son</strong>. First, each beatitude names a class of suffering person and then pronounces a blessing upon them. The alternation
of suffering, blessing, suffering, blessing shouts the number two. <a href="./2-is-for-jesus.html">Two</a> stands for Jesus,
who has two natures (divine and human), as the divine Logos is divided into two Testaments, Old and New, 
will come to earth twice, and whose suffering on the cross is the cause of all blessings that accrue to believers.</p>

<p><strong>The Spirit</strong>. Second, the first seven Beatitudes form a <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>, as first noted in the chapter "A Minute Look at Matthew" in
<em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. The number <a href="./7-is-for-the-holy-spirit.html">seven</a> stands for the Holy Spirit. 
Acquiring and believing the blessing of the seventh Beatitude, becoming adopted into God's family as a son of God, 
is a most critical step. This blessing is specially associated by Paul with action of the Holy Spirit: </p>

<h4>For you did not receive the spirit of slavery</h4>

<h4>to fall back into fear, but you have received</h4>

<h4>the <strong>Spirit of adoption as sons</strong>, by whom we cry,</h4>

<h5>“Abba! Father!”</h5>

<h6>- Romans 8:15</h6>

<p><strong>The Father</strong>. Third, there are nine beatitudes, which is three times three, with <a href="./3-is-for-the-father.html">three</a> being the number for the Father.
When we consider how the Beatitudes reveal the Order of Salvation, it will be apparent that there are three phases, describing our relationship to the Father in each state. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seeker</strong>. The first three Beatitudes are about a seeker hearing the call to faith.</li>
<li><strong>Servant</strong>. The second three Beatitudes are about living as a servant under discipline in God's house, repentant, forgiven, and on the road to sanctification.</li>
<li><strong>Son</strong>. The third three Beatitudes are about living in glorious freedom as a son (or daughter) of God.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each triplet of Beatitudes and their corresponding step toward salvation has one devoted to each member of the Trinity:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Son <strong>calls</strong>, the Spirit <strong>regenerates</strong>, and the Father grants <strong>faith</strong></li>
<li>The Son teaches the prayer of <strong>repentance</strong>, the Father <strong>justifies</strong>, and the Spirit <strong>sanctifies</strong></li>
<li>The Father <strong>adopts</strong>, the Spirit enables <strong>perseverance</strong>, and the Son <strong>glorifies</strong> - <em>when he comes on that day to be <strong>glorified</strong> in his saints</em> (2 Thessalonians 1:10)</li>
</ul>

<p>In truth, all three persons participate in all phases, but one dominates each. For example, the sixth statement by Jesus and the last before the Beatitudes was Jesus calling his first 
disciples. So Jesus is the one who calls, but the choice of whom to call was made by the Father, who gave them to him (John 10:29,17:9).
Likewise, we are saved by faith in Jesus as our savior, but it is the Father who gives us that faith, for it is said:</p>

<h4>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,</h4>

<h4>coming down from the <strong>Father of lights</strong>,</h4>

<h4>with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.</h4>

<h6>- James 1:17</h6>

<p><strong>The Law</strong>. Fourth, though there are nine Beatitudes, the last one is extra long. Each Beatitude corresponds to one of the Ten Commandments, 
but the last one matches two (against lying and covetousness). This begins the transformation of a law that brings death into one the brings eternal life.</p>

<p>From the preceding, we can conclude that it is specifically the Trinitarian God that saves people, with all three persons cooperating seamlessly 
in the process.</p>

<p>Now that we have introduced two key structures in the Beatitudes, the Harvest Pattern and the Ordo Salutis, it is time for a deep dive.
The rest of this article will show, verse by verse, how these ideas connect to the passage and what that means for Christians.
So back we go to the Harvest Pattern.</p>

<h2>The Harvest Pattern of the Beatitudes</h2>

<p>The Bible is filled with patterns and it is important to keep them straight. </p>

<ul>
<li>The Growth Pattern of Solomon is a strategic pattern that covers your entire life. You live through it twice: once materially (life "under the sun") and once spiritually (as salvation followed by sanctification).</li>
<li>The Harvest Pattern of Jesus is a tactical pattern. You reap many harvests in your life, and often they overlap. An individual harvest may last weeks, months, years or even decades. To successfully complete each step or phase of the Growth Pattern requires working through a separate harvest.</li>
<li>The Ordo Salutis is a hybrid pattern. The first seven steps form a Harvest Pattern and are strategic. They carry you through salvation up to the first steps of sanctification. The final two steps of perseverance and glorification represent the completion of your sanctification across the majority of your faith life. Thus this pattern bridges both scales, tactical and strategic.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a refresher, the Harvest Pattern has these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation (of faith in the Lord, respect for the Law, and deciding on what crop to grow this season)</li>
<li>Plowing (of Suffering)</li>
<li>Planting Seeds (of Gospel truth by the Son)</li>
<li>Pouring Water (of emotional help and counsel by the Holy Spirit)</li>
<li>Plucking Weeds (as discipline from the Father)</li>
<li>Producing a Harvest</li>
<li>Peace</li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern is defined by Jesus in Matthew. It is employed structurally at least seventeen times in Matthew, from the overall outline
of the whole book to the structure of short passages. The pattern's most complete realization is the overall structure of the Book of Job.</p>

<h3>Preparation: The Poor in Spirit</h3>

<p>The poor in spirit have set aside their pride. They have been called upon to repent of their sins so that they may enter the kingdom of heaven and they now recognize the sovereignty of their new king. How do we know that this is the preparation for the harvest? We know this first because of what Matthew says about John the Baptist:</p>

<h4>In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</h4>

<h5>“<strong>Repent</strong>, for <strong>the kingdom of heaven</strong> is at hand.”</h5>

<h4>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</h4>

<h5>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:</h5>

<h6>‘<strong>Prepare</strong> the way of the Lord;</h6>

<h6>make his paths straight.’”</h6>

<h6>- Matthew 3:1-3, ESV</h6>

<p>We know this second because when Jesus began his ministry, his first words in the Gospel of Mark were, 
<em>“The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”</em></p>

<p>So to prepare for the harvest, you must consider all that you have to be worthless and seek from God a place in His kingdom. 
You must listen to the first of the Seven Spirits of God, the Spirit of Lordship, 
and take the first steps towards crowning him as the king of your life.</p>

<h3>Plowing: The Mournful</h3>

<p>The second Spirit of God from Isaiah 11:2 is the Spirit of Wisdom; it is the spirit that guides us during the plowing phase. 
Solomon said, <em>“The heart of the <strong>wise</strong> is in the <strong>house of mourning</strong>, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.” (Ecclesiastes 7:4, ESV)</em> 
Wisdom flows from mourning – if you receive that suffering in faith and patience and do not deny your Lord. 
Apart from Jesus, no one better exemplifies the miracles that mourning in faith can yield than Job.</p>

<p>Why do we mourn? We mourn because we have lost something. Job learned of his first loss when he received word from a messenger 
that his cattle had been stolen by raiders while <em>“the oxen were plowing”</em> (Job 1:14) 
Ever since then, plowing has been used as an analogy for suffering or judgment, 
as in Psalm 129:3 (<em>“Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long”</em>), Jeremiah 26:18, Hosea 12:11, Micah 3:12, Isaiah 28:22-29 and Ezekiel 36:9. 
Ezekiel’s usage is powerful and on point, because it shows that even God’s judgment is intended to produce a blessing in the end. 
Ezekiel includes five of the seven phases of the Harvest and collapses the other two into one:</p>

<h4>“ ‘But you, mountains of Israel, will produce branches and fruit</h4>

<h4>for my people Israel, <strong>for they will soon come home</strong>.</h4>

<h4>I am concerned for you and will look on you with favor;</h4>

<h4>you will be <strong>plowed and sown</strong>, and I will cause</h4>

<h4>many people to live on you—yes, all of Israel.</h4>

<h4>The towns will be inhabited and the <strong>ruins rebuilt</strong>.</h4>

<h4>I will <strong>increase</strong> the number of people and animals</h4>

<h4>living on you, and they will be <strong>fruitful</strong> and become numerous.</h4>

<h4>I will settle people on you as in the past</h4>

<h4>and will make you prosper more than before.</h4>

<h4>Then you will know that I am the LORD.</h4>

<h4>I will cause people, my people Israel, to live on you.</h4>

<h4>They will possess you, and you will be their inheritance;</h4>

<h4><strong>you will never again deprive them of their children</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Ezekiel 36:8-12, NIV</h6>

<p>The words <em>“for they will soon come home”</em> mean more that a return from exile, they mean repenting and returning to faith in God, 
the <strong>preparation</strong> for all that would follow, the first phase. Next we see that the land would be “plowed” which matches 
the second phase of <strong>plowing</strong> perfectly. After that it will be “sown”, matching the third phase of <strong>sowing</strong> seed. 
Then Ezekiel combines the <strong>pouring</strong> and <strong>plucking</strong> phases in the phrase “ruins rebuilt”. 
The sixth phase of <strong>producing</strong> a harvest is captured by words like “increase” and “fruitful”. 
Finally, the perpetual blessing of <strong>peace</strong> upon the generations to follow is captured by the promise 
<em>“you will never again deprive them of their children”</em>. Of all the calamities that struck Job, the loss of his children was the hardest to bear, 
so this is the greatest of promises.</p>

<p>Isaiah’s word to the mournful focuses on the despairing attitude that the torment of plowing will never end.</p>

<h4>Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier;</h4>

<h4>the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me</h4>

<h4>of the destruction decreed against the whole land.</h4>

<h4>Listen and hear my voice;</h4>

<h4>pay attention and hear what I say.</h4>

<h4><strong>When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually?</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>Does he keep on breaking up and working the soil?</strong></h4>

<h4>When he has leveled the surface,</h4>

<h4><strong>does he not sow</strong> caraway and scatter cumin?</h4>

<h4><strong>Does he not plant wheat</strong> in its place,</h4>

<h4><strong>barley</strong> in its plot, and <strong>spelt</strong> in its field?</h4>

<h4><strong>His God instructs him and teaches him the right way</strong>.</h4>

<h4>Caraway is not <strong>threshed</strong> with a sledge,</h4>

<h4>nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin;</h4>

<h4>caraway is <strong>beaten</strong> out with a rod,</h4>

<h4>and cumin with a stick.</h4>

<h4><strong>Grain must be ground to make bread</strong>;</h4>

<h4><strong>so one does not go on threshing it forever</strong>.</h4>

<h4>The wheels of a threshing cart may be rolled over it,</h4>

<h4>but one does not use horses to grind grain.</h4>

<h4><strong>All this also comes from the LORD Almighty</strong>,</h4>

<h4><strong>whose plan is wonderful</strong>,</h4>

<h4><strong>whose wisdom is magnificent</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Isaiah 28:22-29, NIV</h6>

<p>Isaiah speaks of plowing, sowing, threshing and producing bread. He speaks of the magnificence of God’s wisdom 
and how he instructs us in the right way. The plowing does not last forever. 
As Jesus promised, the one who mourns will be comforted.</p>

<h3>Planting: The Meek</h3>

<p>In the planting phase, what is planted is the seed of the gospel. How does that tie in with “Blessed are the meek”? How does that connect to inheriting the earth? Let’s start with the second. Among the people of this world, who conquers nations and extends their influence? It is the arrogant and greedy, the charismatic liars who gather multitudes to their cause, wage endless wars and build empires. How does Jesus stack up? In the desert, Satan tempted Jesus by offering him all the kingdoms of the earth in exchange for his worship. (Matthew 4:8-10) Jesus said no. He would go by what was written. He would only worship the Lord God. That was meekness. One day Jesus will return to conquer, but on the Father’s timetable, not his own or Satan’s. Thus an essential part of following the Beatitudes is to submit to God’s timing. This is emphasized in the psalm to which Jesus was referring when he pronounced his blessing:</p>

<h4><strong>Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him</strong>;</h4>

<h5>fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way,</h5>

<h5>over the man who carries out evil devices!</h5>

<h4>Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!</h4>

<h5>Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.</h5>

<h4>For the evildoers shall be cut off,</h4>

<h5><strong>but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 37:7-9, ESV</h6>

<p>To be still and wait patiently upon the Lord and to turn away from human anger to acquire what we desire 
is the very definition of what it is to be meek. A more pointed association to meekness is found in the life of Moses:</p>

<h4>Now the man Moses was very <strong>meek</strong>,</h4>

<h5>more than all people who were on the face of the earth.</h5>

<h6>- Numbers 12:3, ESV</h6>

<p>Moses complained that he was <em>“slow of speech and tongue”</em> (Exodus 4:10). Planting is about taking the words God gives you 
and speaking them to others so that they may be planted and flourish. Moses was the Lawgiver par excellence. 
In meekness he planted. Did he inherit the land? God told Moses that he would die before reaching the Promised Land. 
Instead, his successor Joshua would inherit the land:</p>

<h4>Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people</h4>

<h4>to <strong>inherit the land</strong> that I swore to their fathers to give them.</h4>

<h6>- Joshua 1:6, ESV</h6>

<p>Many of the heroes of faith had to be content to look from afar on the things that they would not inherit until the final resurrection. (Hebrews 11:13-16). 
However, before we inherit the earth, we inherit something of greater importance:</p>

<h4>And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up</h4>

<h4>and knelt before him and asked him,</h4>

<h5>“Good Teacher, what must I do to <strong>inherit eternal life</strong>?”</h5>

<h4>And Jesus said to him,</h4>

<h5>“Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.”</h5>

<h6>- Mark 10:17-18, ESV</h6>

<p>Goodness is generosity, and Jesus, our “Good Teacher”, generously gives eternal life to all who come to him in meekness. 
Not only does he give, but he presents a calm and reassuring demeanor so as not to scare off those 
who come to him in need (Job 16:19-21; 33:6-7):</p>

<h4>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,</h4>

<h5>and I will give you rest.</h5>

<h4>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;</h4>

<h5><strong>for I am meek and lowly in heart</strong>:</h5>

<h5>and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</h5>

<h4>For my yoke is easy,</h4>

<h5>and my burden is light.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 11:28-30, KJV</h6>

<p>The meek can go to Jesus in safety because Jesus is not only meek, he is strong enough to protect 
those who run to him from all enemies in pursuit; he is a king. 
And if you are too weak to go to him, he will come to you. The doctor makes house calls:</p>

<h4>Tell ye the daughter of Sion,</h4>

<h5>Behold, <strong>thy King cometh unto thee, meek</strong>,</h5>

<h5>and sitting upon an ass,</h5>

<h5>and a colt the foal of an ass.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 21:5, KJV</h6>

<p>The spirit that attends this third harvest phase is the Spirit of Understanding. To understand is to “stand under”, 
learning in humility the Word that proceeds from our good teacher. It is to learn through worship the mysteries of God. 
This was not obvious to me.</p>

<p>This is a good time to speak about the three kinds of insight that sound the same but aren’t: wisdom, understanding and knowledge. 
They are respectively the second, third and sixth Spirits of God.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom</strong>. Wisdom flows from suffering. Out of Job’s suffering he discovered all the qualities that he needed in a savior. 
He needed a healer, a friend and mediator, one who could ransom his soul, follow him into the grave and raise him from the dead. 
There are many dimensions to wisdom but it tends to encompass principles, not detailed action plans. 
ey among these principles is grasping the way of salvation.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge</strong>. This species of insight goes beyond wisdom down into the details of how God’s universe operates. Of all the subjects of knowledge, one is supreme: the knowledge of the Holy One.</p>

<h4>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,</h4>

<h5>and the <strong>knowledge of the Holy One</strong> is insight.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 9:10</h6>

<h4>I have not learned wisdom, </h4>

<h5>nor have I <strong>knowledge of the Holy One</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 30:3</h6>

<p>The truest and highest knowledge is the knowledge of Jesus Christ. As first reported in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, 
seven books of the Bible constitute the seven pillars of wisdom which hold up Lady Wisdom’s house in Proverbs 9:1. 
The sixth of those books, corresponding to the sixth spirit and the sixth phase of the Harvest Pattern, is the Gospel of Matthew. 
You will find no better source for knowledge of the Holy One than one of the Gospels that chronicles his life.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding</strong>. How is understanding connected to worship? The answer came to me in pieces.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, it came to me through worship. </li>
<li>Second, through a nagging question. </li>
<li>Third, through the discovery of the seven pillars of wisdom and their relationship to the seven Spirits of God.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Worship</em>. From January to June 1988, I spent time every day reading, meditating and praying over the Book of Proverbs. 
Towards the end, I began to relate to the text in a new way. I began to worship Jesus through Proverbs. 
I reasoned that the wise principles in that book describe how Jesus thinks and acts. They express his values and his priorities.
With each proverb I learned, I was getting to know my savior more. Before that, to worship God I would have turned to the Psalms. 
This change in me means that I had absorbed with partial awareness the connection between worship and understanding.</p>

<p><em>A nagging question</em>. I have always loved the story of Joshua meeting the man with the drawn sword.</p>

<h4>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked,</h4>

<h4>and behold, <strong>a man was standing before him with</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>his drawn sword in his hand</strong>.</h4>

<h4>And Joshua went to him and said to him,</h4>

<h5>“Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”</h5>

<h4>And he said,</h4>

<h5>“No; but I am the commander of the army of the Lord.</h5>

<h4>Now I have come.”</h4>

<h4><strong>And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped</strong></h4>

<h4>and said to him,</h4>

<h5>“What does my lord say to his servant?”</h5>

<h4>And the commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua,</h4>

<h5>“Take off your sandals from your feet,</h5>

<h5>for the place where you are standing is holy.”</h5>

<h4>And Joshua did so.</h4>

<h6>- Joshua 5:13-15, ESV</h6>

<p>Many Christians believe that the swordsman was the pre-incarnate Christ. The question is, how did Joshua know? 
What changed his mind in an instant about this total stranger? The man is not described as glowing or special in any way. 
No miraculous sign was given. When I finally had the sense to investigate this question, the first clue was the word “worship”. 
A short time later, Jericho would fall as the Israelites blew trumpets and marched about the city, worshiping Yahweh. There is power in worship.
Only when I got curious about the use of swords as symbolism in Scripture did I crack this mystery. 
I reported my discovery in “Swords, Seals &amp; Surviving to Saturday” in my book <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. 
It turns out that Moses prophesied this event in his final song:</p>

<h4><strong>“‘See now that I, even I, am he,</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and there is no god beside me;</strong></h5>

<h4><strong>I kill and I make alive;</strong></h4>

<h5> <strong>I wound and I heal;</strong></h5>

<h5>and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</h5>

<h4>For I lift up my hand to heaven</h4>

<h5>and swear, As I live forever,</h5>

<h4>if <strong>I sharpen my flashing sword</strong></h4>

<h5>and my hand takes hold on judgment,</h5>

<h4>I will take vengeance on my adversaries</h4>

<h5>and will repay those who hate me.</h5>

<h4>I will make my arrows drunk with blood,</h4>

<h5><strong>and my sword shall devour flesh</strong>—</h5>

<h4>with the blood of the slain and the captives,</h4>

<h5> from the long-haired heads of the enemy.’</h5>

<h6>- Deuteronomy 32:39-42</h6>

<p>This amazing song prophesied a time when the Lord would draw His sword and fight for his people. 
He is described as one who can bring people back to life. When Moses delivered this prophecy, 
who heard it, how important did he say that it was, and when did he say that it would take place?</p>

<h4><strong>Moses came and recited all the words of this song</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>in the hearing of the people,</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>he and Joshua the son of Nun.</strong></h4>

<h4>And when Moses had finished speaking</h4>

<h4>all these words to all Israel, he said to them,</h4>

<h5>“Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today,</h5>

<h5>that you may command them to your children, that they</h5>

<h5>may be careful to do all the words of this law.</h5>

<h4><strong>For it is no empty word for you, but your very life,</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and by this word you shall live long in the land</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>that you are going over the Jordan to possess</strong>.”</h5>

<h6>- Deuteronomy 32:44-47</h6>

<p>Joshua was there! The Bible makes it crystal clear that Joshua not only heard the words, but he helped recite the words for the people to hear. 
Moses said that the words would be important when they crossed the Jordan and that is when they met the man with the drawn sword.</p>

<p>Those words of Moses were a worship song. Because Joshua was a man who worshiped God, he took his marching orders from a song. 
The understanding of who that swordsman was came through worship.</p>

<p><em>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>. Once I discovered the Seven Pillars of Wisdom and attempted to match each one of 
the Seven Spirits of God to a pillar book, the riddle of what understanding means became clear. 
In the ESV, the words understand, understands and understanding appear 43 times in Proverbs, the most of any book in the Bible. 
The clincher is in Proverbs 9, which tells us of the existence of the Seven Pillars (Proverbs 9:1) in the context of worship:</p>

<h4>“Come, eat of my <strong>bread</strong></h4>

<h5>and drink of the <strong>wine</strong> I have mixed.</h5>

<h4>Leave your simple ways, and live,</h4>

<h5>and walk in the way of insight.”</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 9:5-6</h6>

<p>Does this not remind you of the Christian communion celebration? Therefore to obtain deep understanding of the ways of God, you must worship Him in spirit and in truth.</p>

<h3>Pouring: The Hungry &amp; Thirsty</h3>

<p>What does it mean to hunger and thirst after righteousness? 
It means to desire holiness in your own life and justice and equity in all your dealings with others. 
In the economic Trinity:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Planting Phase</em> was focused on the work of the Son because he is the Word of God, hence is both sower and seed. His domain is the mind and speech.</li>
<li><em>The Plucking Phase</em> will focus on the work of the Father. His domain is the physical realm of action, forming habits, defining priorities and managing time.</li>
<li><em>This Pouring Phase</em> is focused on the work of the Holy Spirit which is often symbolized by water, as in baptism. His domain is the heart and its passions, desires and dreams. Naturally, the Holy Spirit is all about holiness. The Spirit is our Counselor (or Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby, Helper, or Companion, as variously rendered by different translations for John 14:16), encouraging, advising, warning and convicting our souls. The prophets are types of the Holy Spirit. They, like the Spirit, do not speak their own words but instead apply and interpret the words of the Son in each given situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>To manage this special focus on counseling, this phase is governed by the fourth Spirit of God, the Spirit of Counsel. Thus when Jesus says that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied or filled, it is with the Holy Spirit that he intends to fill them. He uses that imagery of drinking because as the Holy Spirit is represented as water, one who drinks deeply is filled, just as Jesus said to the woman at the well, with living water. Jesus uses the imagery of hungering because he later calls himself the bread of life, the bread broken for his disciples. It is disciples of Jesus who will be filled.</p>

<p>The essential truth to be learned here is that it is not willpower, hard work, ingenuity, conscientiousness, discipline, genius, education or any other admirable human quality that will fuel this drive toward holiness. It is hunger and thirst, the humble admission of need. The enemy is junk food, the food of this world that does not nourish your soul. If you feed perpetually on that food your belly will be full but your soul will wither from lack of nutrition.</p>

<p>In the parable of the soils, the Pouring Phase matches the rocky soil that offers no protection form the sun. Only regular irrigation by the Holy Spirit can protect you from the heat of persecution or hardship and soften that rocky heart until it is a heart of flesh. Yet ponder the image of the sun. The trampled soil could not protect the seed from the bird, who is Satan. The sun is not Satan – it is the glory of God. The Old Testament often said that no one can see the face of God and live. We cannot withstand the withering gaze of all that energy pouring from the throne. We need the refreshment of the Holy Spirit to come between us and that glory so that we are not dried out and set ablaze. With that living water in us, we can photosynthesize the light and put it to productive use as we grow toward maturity.</p>

<h3>Plucking: The Merciful</h3>

<p>The merciful take tangible action to help their neighbor. They move in the material plane, the domain of the Father. Their mercy towards men shall be rewarded with greater mercy from God. Yet I wonder, does this beatitude conceal a riddle?</p>

<p>The fifth spirit of God is the Spirit of Might. God plucks thorns and weeds and prunes dead branches from us to make us fruitful. Those thorns and weeds are the distractions of life, like pleasure, wealth, worry and all the rest. If your time and energy are not wasted on unproductive or sinful pursuits, then you will have more strength to devote to the things that please God and expand His kingdom. You will become mighty. Your life will make an impact. Having not squandered your money on idle pursuits, you will have resources to devote to acts of mercy.</p>

<p>The various translations of this beatitude say that the merciful will receive, be shown, obtain or get mercy, kindness or loving-kindness. I do not believed that such divine kindness is meant to end there. The Father is our teacher. When he shows us kindness He is also showing us how to be kind. He is teaching us the depths of mercy and imparting creative ways to bless our neighbor. How many charities have been started by Christians over the centuries? How many new ways to help have we discovered? We send teachers, we send doctors, we rescue orphans, we advocate for prisoners… God is forever opening our eyes to see what mercy is and how we can change to offer it. Mercy is not obvious or else the world would not have needed the church to teach it to them. That is the riddle.</p>

<h4>The righteous care for the needs of their animals,</h4>

<h5>but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 12:10, NIV</h6>

<p>The wicked think that the best help for people suffering pain or depression is euthanasia. The wicked think that the best help for a woman with an unwanted pregnancy is to abort the child. The wicked think that the best way to combat the drug trade is to legalize drugs. The wicked think that the best way to serve failing students is to give them passing grades so they don’t feel bad. The wicked think that denying African nations loans to build low cost energy infrastructure as a means to save the environment is kind even if it costs the lives of millions dying or being unable to get jobs for lack of access to inexpensive electricity. The wicked think that mining rare metals is so important to their rich lifestyle that it is kind to do it using child or slave labor. The wicked think that dangerous drugs and surgeries can turn women into men and men into women in the hope of reducing suicides among people confused about their gender, when research shows that the opposite occurs, plus life threatening complications. Unwise and uncaring social policies, promulgated in the name of helping people, pass for the world’s idea of kindness. That kindness is cruel. We need God to teach us what true mercy is. Those who start down that road by following what is already clear in the Bible will be led down new paths that deliver greater depths of mercy to the poor who are desperate to receive it. </p>

<h3>Producing: The Pure in Heart</h3>

<p>The sixth spirit of God is the Spirit of Knowledge. It is the knowledge of the Holy One. One who is pure in heart has a holy heart. The blessing that they receive is to see God. Everyone in the audience that day when Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount saw the face of a man. If any of them already had a pure heart, they would know that they were also looking at the face of God. It is not God’s absence that prevents us from seeing His face, it is our hearts. One who has pursued the previous blessings with great hunger and thirst and mercy will arrive at this stage with eyes that can perceive that face aright.</p>

<h4>For God, who said,</h4>

<h5>“Let light shine out of darkness,”</h5>

<h4>has shone in our hearts to give the light of</h4>

<h4><strong>the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- 2 Corinthians 4:6</h6>

<p>As we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us in repentance and wash us of all moral filth, our eyes will be cleaned of their filth and we shall see Jesus as he truly is. Just getting to the place where I realized that the pursuit of God’s glory is of first importance took me over twenty-five years. May it take you less time than I!</p>

<h3>Peace: The Peacemakers</h3>

<p>After you bring in a harvest at the end of the season, you can enjoy peace. In the harvest of the Beatitudes, we see the goodness of God at work. The human posture is that at the end of a harvest, you store your surplus away in barns and celebrate. Since the crops are yours, the peace is yours, too. Not so! We are called to be peacemakers. We must share our peace with others. That is evangelism, because our crop is souls. Without sharing the gospel with others, we have no crop! After we do share our peace, we can be called “sons of God”.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ordo Salutis</em> according to Jesus</h2>

<p>Oh, I was ready to end the chapter here, but there are two more beatitudes and the phrase “be called sons of God” tickled a memory. That means to be adopted into God’s family. The doctrine of adoption is one that gave me trouble in my last book. While writing “Psalm 19: The Glory of God’s Law” for <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, I made a discovery. Verse by verse that Psalm gives the <em>Ordo Salutis</em>, the order of salvation. That sequence breaks the process of salvation into smaller steps and arranges them in order. Handy, no? Each denomination has its own version of the <em>Ordo Salutis</em> and they differ in the number of steps and their order. Of all the orders I have studied, none come closer to the order found in Psalm 19 than the Reformed order of eleven steps. Comparing Psalm 19 to the Reformed order, one step is missing (Predestination), one is vague (Election) and one is out of place (Adoption).</p>

<p>So noticing a reference to Adoption in the Beatitudes, I had to see how much of the process of salvation was there and whether it matched what I had found when I studied Psalm 19. Surprise! Not only is most of the process also found in the Beatitudes, but it matches Psalm 19! Like the psalm, the first two Reformed steps – Predestination and Election – are missing. Again like Psalm 19, in the Beatitudes the step of Adoption is slightly out of order, coming after Sanctification, not before. The omitted steps happen to be the steps most in contention in the debates between those who hold to the Reformed tradition and the many others who argue against those doctrines. Thus the Beatitudes cannot be used to settle that debate. As for adoption, I am betting that it is the Reformed sequence that needs a tweak, not Jesus! So here is the Ordo Salutis according to Jesus, not a Christian denomination.</p>

<p>Before diving into the order of the steps of salvation, a word of clarification. The Beatitudes may be used to compose the order of the steps but not to precisely define the meaning of each step. For example, each denomination attributes different meanings to justification and sanctification and this analysis alone is insufficient to choose among them.</p>

<p>In what follows, each Step of salvation is followed by a quote from Psalm 19 that corresponds to that step of salvation and a blessing quoted from Matthew 5 with some commentary.
By combining David's prayer and Jesus' promise, the association with that step of salvation and its meaning are sharpened.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Calling</h3>

<p>Before we even get to the Beatitudes, three of Jesus' initial statements in Matthew relate to calling. First, we have his response to John the Baptist, who
questioned why Jesus needed to be baptized. His answer was, *"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” *(Matthew 3:15)
This tells us that we are called to righteousness.</p>

<p>Second, we have the summary given to Jesus' initial preaching:</p>

<h4>From that time Jesus began to preach, saying,</h4>

<h5>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 4:17</h6>

<p>This tells us that Jesus' call is consists of a goal and a requirement. The goal is to enter the kingdom of heaven and the requirement is repentance. </p>

<p>Third, we have Jesus' final statement before the Beatitudes, spoken to Peter and Andrew:</p>

<h4>And he said to them,</h4>

<h5>“Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 4:19</h6>

<p>The final part of the call is to follow Jesus (to learn from him and imitate his way of life) and then become one who can make disciples of others by teaching them the same.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. This psalm is a prayer of David, but it is constructed in a marvelous way. The first eleven verses are not a request, 
they are a meditation on the good things that God does for him of His own initiative. Not until verses 12-14 does David present his own petition for help.</p>

<h4>Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.</h4>

<h4>There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:2-3</h6>

<p>In this Psalm we hear God's call going forth. What does Jesus add to this call?</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. Jesus identifies who it is that he is calling. Not the rich, the proud or the strong, but the humble and poor.</p>

<h4>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</h4>

<h5>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:3</h6>

<p>This is the call that invites the humble sinner to approach the gates of the kingdom of heaven. 
They are called to repent, but that repentance does not happen yet.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Regeneration</h3>

<p>What is regeneration? It is the born again transformation spoken of by the prophet Ezekiel:</p>

<h4>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you;</h4>

<h4>I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.</h4>

<h4>And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees</h4>

<h5>and be careful to keep my laws.”</h5>

<h6>- Ezekiel 36:26-27</h6>

<p>The spirit of death that was in us is replaced by a new and living spirit.
Your deadened conscience is awakened, terrifying you as you become aware of the depth of your sin 
because the laws of God are now written on your heart.
This prepares you for the next step of faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. David tells us the same thing, but more concisely, calling regeneration the "reviving of the soul":</p>

<h4>The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul...</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:7a</h6>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. Whereas David speaks of what God shall do, Jesus speaks of the sinner's response.</p>

<h4>Blessed are those who mourn,</h4>

<h5>for they will be comforted.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:4</h6>

<p>The revived soul mourns at a life of offending God and harming neighbors.
All pretense of being a good person is ripped away and the damage to one's self image is a hard loss to bear.
You are told that all you have worked for was in vain and of no value. That is cause to mourn.
The comfort that such a soul needs is the regeneration that brings them to a place where the chains of sin are not so strong that they have
no possibility of turning to God in faith. The terror of facing God is reduced because of the comforting tone and humble demeanor of the messenger,
Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Faith</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. Verses 4-9 tell us so much! As part of the call we are told the identity of the Lord (verse 5), then we are regenerated (verse 7a),
and finally we turn to Jesus in faith (verse 8-9). </p>

<h4>Their voice goes out through all the earth,</h4>

<h5>and their words to the end of the world.</h5>

<h4>In them he has set a tent for the sun,</h4>

<h4><strong>which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber</strong>,</h4>

<h5><strong>and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Its rising is from the end of the heavens,</h4>

<h5>and its circuit to the end of them,</h5>

<h5>and there is nothing hidden from its heat.</h5>

<h4>The law of <strong>the Lord</strong> is perfect,</h4>

<h5>reviving the soul;</h5>

<h4>the testimony of <strong>the Lord</strong> is sure,</h4>

<h5>making wise the simple;</h5>

<h4>the precepts of <strong>the Lord</strong> are right,</h4>

<h5>rejoicing the heart;</h5>

<h4>the commandment of <strong>the Lord</strong> is pure,</h4>

<h5>enlightening the eyes;</h5>

<h4>the fear of <strong>the Lord</strong> is clean,</h4>

<h5>enduring forever;</h5>

<h4>the rules of <strong>the Lord</strong> are true,</h4>

<h5>and righteous altogether.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 19:4-9</h6>

<p>How are we told who was sent to deliver that message?
First, this passage six times uses the phrase "the Lord", out of the seven times it appears in the body of the Psalm.
that is our first clue that we are being told something about the identity of the Lord.
Second, we are told that God has sent a strong man called the Bridegroom, a man full of joy. Who is this Bridegroom? 
Jesus alludes to the bridegroom in his parable of the Ten Virgins in Matthew 25, but owns the title here:</p>

<h4>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying,</h4>

<h5>“Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”</h5>

<h4>And Jesus said to them,</h4>

<h5>“Can the wedding guests mourn as long as <strong>the bridegroom</strong></h5>

<h5>is with them? The days will come when <strong>the bridegroom</strong> is</h5>

<h5>taken away from them, and then they will fast."</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 9:14-15</h6>

<p>Jesus is the Bridegroom who brings salvation! The Beatitudes are subtler.
Not until we reach the last Beatitude do we find that the grantor of all these promises is Jesus:</p>

<h4>Blessed are you when others revile you and</h4>

<h4>persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you</h4>

<h4>falsely <strong>on my account</strong>.</h4>

<p>The key words are "on my account". All this depends on us proving our loyalty to Jesus. 
All these blessings and promises, this great salvation, this “great reward” in heaven that is our glorification – 
all are contingent on placing our faith specifically in Jesus Christ as our savior.</p>

<p>How does David describe faith in the Lord? His term for placing your faith in the Lord is to fear the Lord.</p>

<p>And how extensive is this salvation? Is it just for this life? No!
We are told that "the fear of the Lord is clean, <strong>enduring forever</strong>." 
This salvation is the offer of eternal life.</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. We are told two things in this Beatitude: the character of the acceptable believer and the character of the Lord.</p>

<h4>Blessed are the meek,</h4>

<h5>for they will inherit the earth.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:5</h6>

<p>This blessing of sovereignty over the earth is offered to the meek by the meek. How could Jesus inherit the earth (for it is from he, upon his death, that we inherit it)
unless he were also meek?</p>

<p>It is the step of faith that causes us to receive our inheritance. And what is that inheritance? It is more than land.
It is the same thing that is offered in the Psalm. It is what the rich young ruler craved when he asked Jesus, 
“Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” It is what John so memorably declared: </p>

<h4>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son,</h4>

<h5>that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</h5>

<h6>- John 3:16</h6>

<p>That inheritance is eternal life and that belief is faith.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Repentance</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. David's faith is shown to be true by what he says next.</p>

<h4>Moreover, by them is your servant warned;</h4>

<h5>in keeping them there is great reward.</h5>

<h4>Who can discern his errors?</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:11-12a</h6>

<p>The first part of repentance is to be warned of your sin. God tells you exactly what you have done wrong when
the Holy Spirit convicts you of your sins.</p>

<p>The second part of repentance is to discern your errors. This is to recognize in yourself and admit what you have done wrong.</p>

<p>It is the third part of repentance that is the sticking point. It is tucked in between the first two.
Who but a person of faith believes that by listening to the Lord, learning of your sins and then admitting them, you will receive a great reward?
To act on that belief, you must be convinced that God is a loving and forgiving God, otherwise your confession will result only in punishment. </p>

<p>To heed the Lord’s warnings, of course, requires that you now keep his commands, showing the fruits of true repentance.</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. Jesus tells us there is more to repentance than just believing God is loving and forgiving.</p>

<h4>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be satisfied.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:6</h6>

<p>In some translations, in place of “satisfied” the word is “filled”. 
True repentance is expressed as a hunger to be that which you are not, namely righteous. 
It is a gift, thus a person must be filled with a spirit of repentance if they are to sincerely turn around.
It is not just your actions that must change, but the things you crave in your soul.
You must begin to pray along with Jesus, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."</p>

<p>Saint Anselm despised the "Ransom Theory" in which it was thought that Jesus paid a ransom to the devil to reclaim our souls from hell.
In place of it, he proposed the "Satisfaction Theory". The payment that is due belongs to the Father, not the devil.
The glory that God deserves yet failed to receive from sinners who oppose him is a debt that must be satisfied.
Jesus, by going beyond what was required in his own glorifying of his Father, made satisfaction for our sins.
Yet here, the Lord shows his unselfishness and great love. Though God is the one who deserves to be "satisfied", 
we who hunger and thirst are the ones who will be satisfied. How amazing is this grace!</p>

<h3>Step 5: Justification</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. To be declared innocent by God; how great is that!</p>

<h4><strong>Declare me innocent</strong> from hidden faults.</h4>

<h4>Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;</h4>

<h5>let them not have dominion over me!</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 19:12b-13b</h6>

<p>For a thousand years or more, the church was confused. They conflated Justification and Sanctification.
There are two main theories about how justification works, Infused Justification, and Imputed Justification. 
Here is what Microsoft Copilot has to say about that:</p>

<p><em>In Christian theology, the concepts of infused and imputed justification are central to understanding different perspectives on how humans are made righteous before God.</em></p>

<p><strong>Imputed Justification:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Protestant View</em>: This concept is primarily associated with Protestant theology, especially within Reformed traditions.</li>
<li><em>Definition</em>: Imputed justification means that the righteousness of Christ is credited to the believer's account. It is a legal declaration where God declares a sinner to be righteous based on the righteousness of Christ.</li>
<li><em>Mechanism</em>: This righteousness is external and is not based on the believer's own merits or actions. It is received by faith alone.</li>
<li><em>Key Verse</em>: Romans 4:3, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Infused Justification:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Catholic View</em>: This concept is primarily associated with Roman Catholic theology.</li>
<li><em>Definition</em>: Infused justification means that God's grace is poured into the believer's soul, transforming them and making them inherently righteous.</li>
<li><em>Mechanism</em>: This righteousness is internal and involves a process of sanctification where the believer cooperates with God's grace through faith and good works.</li>
<li><em>Key Verse</em>: James 2:24, "You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone."</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In summary, imputed justification is about being declared righteous through faith in Christ's righteousness, while infused justification is about becoming righteous through the transformative power of God's grace. Both views emphasize the importance of God's grace but differ in how that grace is applied and experienced in the believer's life.</em></p>

<p>One way to describe the difference is that the Reformed version is <em>monergistic</em>, meaning God alone is responsible, whereas the Catholic view is <em>synergistic</em>,
a cooperative process where both God and the believer are at work together. The Reformed position came about by splitting one concept into two. 
If Justification and Sanctification are two separate steps, then the first, Justification, can be monergistic and acquired instantly by faith alone, while the second,
Sanctification, can be synergistic and accomplished over a long period.</p>

<p>Which view is correct (and there are others)? The wording of the psalm seems clear. God declares the sinner innocent with no action required of the supplicant.
Then, with the powerful joy of an innocent heart set free and the besetting presumptuous sins weakened in their potency, a person may proceed to the next step of sanctification.
For so long as sin has <strong>dominion</strong> over the unforgiven soul, no sanctification is possible.</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. The undeserving and unearned aspects of justification are stated in a different way by Jesus.</p>

<h4>Blessed are the merciful,</h4>

<h5>for they will be shown mercy.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:7</h6>

<p>We are justified as an act of mercy. However, there is a condition, which tilts the needle back toward the Catholic position.
It is the merciful who are shown mercy. It is the people who practice forgiveness of others that are forgiven.
This echoes the Lord's Prayer, which says, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."
It also matches the parable of the unforgiving servant, who was forgiven a large debt but then oppressed another servant who owed him much less.
That unforgiving servant had his debt reinstated.
The cause and effect relationship is tricky to work out, but it seems to be this:</p>

<ul>
<li>God forgives us without condition</li>
<li>In gratitude, we show forgiveness to others</li>
<li>God confirms our forgiveness by making it permanent, in recognition of our response</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this mean that we can lose our salvation? No, rather it separates from the true believers those who seek forgiveness for selfish reasons, to escape punishment,
but have no regard for righteousness. The merciful truly hunger and thirst for righteousness, thus begin to act righteously after they are freed from debtor's prison.
It is what we do with our new liberty that proves who we are and confirms whether we have saving faith.</p>

<p>It was this doctrine of Justification by faith that triggered the Protestant Reformation and upended the world.
It is not a trifling idea.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Sanctification</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. The sanctified person is blameless and innocent; they have been made holy.</p>

<h4>Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:13cd</h6>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>.  Jesus promises us that we shall be blameless and innocent not just of great transgression but of all transgression!</p>

<h4>Blessed are the pure in heart,</h4>

<h5>for they shall see God.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:8</h6>

<p>Sanctification is the process of being made holy and pure, through and through. 
In an instant, our position is changed from unsanctified to sanctified. This is "positional sanctification". It is the way God sees us.
It is monergistic and accomplished entirely by grace.</p>

<p>Then over a lifetime, our attitudes, words and actions are progressively improved until we are perfect in every way. 
This is "progressive sanctification". It is synergistic, meaning that we cooperate through our actions to further this work.</p>

<p>This bifurcation of sanctification into an instant event and a process means that the next step, Adoption, is really sandwiched in between the two.</p>

<p>As we become holier over the course of our lives, we are able to see God more clearly, not with our physical eyes, but by faith.
His wisdom and ways become ever clearer. His Word makes more sense. Our conviction of His presence and our coming reward and reception into heaven
become more certain. This is deeply satisfying. This is the part of our life when the Holy Spirit becomes a real person to us.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Adoption</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. As expressed in this psalm, the idea of adoption is weak, in comparison to the other doctrines.
God is Lord, rock and redeemer, but not Father. The strongest word is "acceptable". Could anyone in David's time
believe that God's full acceptance would extend to adopting us as His children?</p>

<h4>be acceptable in your sight,</h4>

<h4>O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:14cd</h6>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. Psalm and Beatitude could not be farther apart in clarity. 
This is THE verse where Jesus introduces the idea that God adopts fallen human beings into his family.</p>

<h4>Blessed are the peacemakers,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be called sons of God.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:9</h6>

<p>This is the most revolutionary statement in the entirety of the Beatitudes!
To be so at peace with God and so treasured that He would welcome you into His family - what better outcome could there possibly be for your life!
The world casually presumes that we are all children of God, but the Bible does not back that up.</p>

<h4>11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.</h4>

<h4><strong>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name</strong>,</h4>

<h4>he gave the right to become children of God, who were born,</h4>

<h4>not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man,</h4>

<h4>but of God.</h4>

<h6>- John 1:11-13</h6>

<p>Only people people who believe in Jesus' name have the right to become children of God.
You have to become a child of God; you don't start out that way. That is why you must be born again.
Why is it important to believe that by faith in Jesus you become a child of God?
When things get tough, what father will not do everything in his power to rescue one of his children?
We will undergo such dangers, so we need to know He will come for us.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Perseverance</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. One part of verse 14 tells us that there is trouble ahead.</p>

<h4>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart </h4>

<h4>be acceptable in your sight,</h4>

<h4>O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:14</h6>

<p>We only run to hide behind, atop or inside a rock when we face persecution or hardship. 
David hid from Saul in a cave. Having been perfected by God, may we persist in all subsequent actions 
that we may remain "acceptable in [God’s] sight", hence persevere.</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. The hint of persecution in Psalm 19 becomes an overt warning when Jesus speaks.</p>

<h4>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,</h4>

<h5>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:10</h6>

<p>To pursue a righteous life and promote that way of life to others even in the face of persecution is the essence of perseverance.
As I pondered this eighth beatitude, I wondered if it applied only to being persecuted for being a Christian or also to 
any righteous actions taken by people. Bonhoeffer affirms the latter in his chapter on the Beatitudes in <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em>:</p>

<h4>It is important that Jesus gives his blessing not merely to</h4>

<h4>suffering incurred directly for the confession of his name,</h4>

<h4>but to suffering in any just cause. They receive the</h4>

<h4>same promise as the poor, for in persecution they are</h4>

<h4>their equals in poverty.</h4>

<h6>- Dietrich Bonhoeffer</h6>

<h3>Step 9: Glorification</h3>

<p><strong>Psalm 19</strong>. On the surface, it would seem that the theme of glory is out of place in our order of salvation, at least
as it is spoken of in Psalm 19:</p>

<h4>The heavens declare the glory of God,</h4>

<h5>and the sky above proclaims his handiwork…</h5>

<h4>O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 19:1,14d</h6>

<p>David put glory first, in the first verse of the psalm. However, that is the glory of God as seen in nature by His actions as Creator. 
This psalm reveals a second glory. That glory is the glory of God as our Redeemer. 
That glory comes last, in verse 14. There is a mystery and it is the mystery that Paul revealed. There are many ways that God 
could have accomplished that redemption but he chose a joyous and unexpected one.</p>

<p><strong>Beatitude</strong>. What does it mean when Jesus said, "your reward is great in heaven"?</p>

<h4>Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you</h4>

<h4>and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.</h4>

<h4>Rejoice and be glad, for <strong>your reward is great in heaven</strong>,</h4>

<h4>for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 5:11</h6>

<p>First, this Beatitude ties all the blessings to Jesus' name. It supplies the essential context for salvation.</p>

<p>Second, while the previous Beatitude was about persecution, this one is not. It is about shame.
Yes, it speaks about persecution - and that persecution may be severe - but the devil's goal and the world's goal
in that persecution is to heap shame upon Christ and all who follow him. His goal is to rob the Son of God of
his glory. Because shame is the devil's goal, God counters it by doing the unthinkable...</p>

<p>The answer to what your reward can be may be found by inverting your suffering. </p>

<ul>
<li>If your name is reviled by the world because you call on Jesus, God will praise your name.</li>
<li>If you endure persecution and suffer pain and loss, God will give you joy and heavenly treasure.</li>
<li>If evil lies are told of you, God will broadcast affirming truths about your faith.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, God will glorify you. Being glorified is the opposite of being reviled. The great reward of the church 
shall the glorification of the saints in heaven in their new bodies and status. 
That is the great mystery that the Lord gave to Paul to proclaim:</p>

<h4>I became a minister according to the stewardship from God</h4>

<h4>that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,</h4>

<h4><strong>the mystery hidden for ages and generations</strong> but</h4>

<h4>now revealed to his saints.</h4>

<h4>To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles</h4>

<h4>are the riches of the glory of <strong>this mystery</strong>,</h4>

<h4>which is <strong>Christ in you, the hope of glory</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Colossians 1:25-27</h6>

<p>The Psalm begins by extolling the Glory of God. The end result of that Glory is the gracious,
undeserved glorification of fallen humanity through the divine act of redemption.
Then Jesus calls this our great reward. But how was this possible? Did not God say this?</p>

<h4>For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,</h4>

<h5>for how should my name be profaned?</h5>

<h5><strong>My glory I will not give to another</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Isaiah 48:11</h6>

<p>If God will not give his glory to another, how can he give His glory to us?
It is because he does not give us His glory, He gives it to Christ. But He gave us Jesus to live inside us, and 
God's glory shines forth from Jesus. Thus the Spirit of Jesus in our hearts shines forth his glory
and because we identify with his name by not rejecting it despite persecution, his glory shines forth from us.
There is no better outcome in life or in death than to receive such a gift as this.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Process of Salvation</h3>

<p>In Psalm 19, King David prays to the Lord for salvation. In the Beatitudes, Jesus answers David’s prayer, point for point. </p>

<p>By this interpretation, we can see that the Beatitudes define the whole process of salvation and sanctification from the initial call to the final glorification of the saints at the time when Christ returns. Why is this helpful? First, wars have been fought over this process. How many steps should there be? In what order should we arrange them? Is there even an order or is it all simultaneous? The various theories rely on assembling clues scattered throughout the Bible and using human logic to fill in the gaps. Any one of the formulations could be right – or none of them. That means that even if the steps are Biblical the system is merely semi-Biblical.</p>

<p>With the system in this chapter, we have a Bible passage where each verse corresponds to a single step in the <em>Ordo Salutis</em>. This single passage contains the whole of it, with additional details supplied by Psalm 19. That is systematic and Biblical. It also suggests objectively that we have all the steps, at least at this level of granularity, e.g. some people break the calling into two parts, an internal and external call. This makes the order easier to defend and understand. Furthermore, the close correspondence with Psalm 19 means that we have both Old and New Testament support for this order.</p>

<p>There are subtleties that demand further investigation, however. It is commonly accepted that sanctification occurs in two parts: positional and progressive. We are instantly sanctified in God’s eyes at the time of salvation, but the changes to our behavior that follow this occur over the course of a lifetime. This bifurcation may also apply to other steps.</p>

<p>The last thing to think about is who is responsible for accomplishing these steps of salvation. 
The Beatitudes may speak of people showing mercy or being peacemakers, but each step begins and ends with a blessing.
Each step begins and ends with the grace of God.</p>

<p>And does that grace only save individuals? No, these Beatitudes prophesy a great, worldwide salvation of the church, of a people called out of the world into a visible kingdom...</p>
