<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>The Beatitudes are more than scattered promises of divine help for people with different needs and 
more than a summary of character qualities that are essential in a disciple of Christ. This article will
show that the Beatitudes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are the answer to King David's prayer for salvation in Psalm 19</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>, showing the path from unbelief to peace with God</li>
<li>Line up with the Ten Commandments, point for point, in order</li>
<li>Define the <em>Ordo Salutis</em> (Order of salvation), the nine steps from God's initial call to a saint's glorification</li>
<li>Reveal God's prophetic plan to unveil each doctrine in the <em>Ordo Salutis</em> with power, in Chronological order, thereby shaking the world and carrying the Church toward maturity</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="./celestial-clocks.html#19">Celestial Clocks - The Order of Salvation Clock</a> for a concise presentation 
of just the prophetic content of the Beatitudes. </p>

<h2>Admitting that You Need Help</h2>

<p>Decades ago I was sitting in a seminar related to my job. It had something to do with self-improvement and was based on ideas taken from psychology. The goal may have been to foster stronger teams in the workplace but the focus was on individual effort and advancement. Minutes before, the facilitator put up a slide on the projector with the neat and tidy steps that would get you to the goal. I had no background in this area, had taken no classes in psychology and human development and do not recall having read books related to the subject. All I had was an analytical mind and no sense of boundaries or the following of social norms, courtesy of my as yet undiagnosed Asperger’s. Give me a list and I will do four things. First, I will count it. Second, I will decide if any of the items are wrong or do not belong. Third, I will decide if any of them are out of sequence. Fourth and most difficult, I will search for holes. Are any steps in the process missing?</p>

<p>Before the lecturer had a chance to finish summarizing these ideas which were the outline of the entire seminar, ideas which I had never seen before, I raised my hand and said, “You’re missing a step.” The man was a bit dumb-founded but humored me by asking what that step might be. I said, “The first step is that you have to want to change.”</p>

<p>Isn’t that what repentance is? It is recognizing that you need to go in a new direction and to do that you need to change. Going beyond psychology, that recognition must be coupled with an admission that you cannot make those changes by yourself. You need God. No human program of self-improvement will succeed. You must admit you are poor and turn in faith to the God who is rich in forgiveness and grace. The lecturer in my seminar (and the authors of the course who stood behind him) missed that crucial first step. In Matthew 5-7 we get to listen in on a different seminar, taught by someone who did not miss. And yes, Jesus put that first step first. We call that first step of realizing that you have needs that only God can meet the Beatitudes.</p>

<p>These are the first seven Beatitudes:</p>

<h4>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</h4>

<h5>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are those who mourn,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be comforted.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the meek,</h4>

<h5>for they shall inherit the earth.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be satisfied.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the merciful,</h4>

<h4>for they shall receive mercy.</h4>

<h4>Blessed are the pure in heart,</h4>

<h5>for they shall see God.</h5>

<h4>Blessed are the peacemakers,</h4>

<h5>for they shall be called sons of God.</h5>

<h6>- Matthew 5:3-9, ESV</h6>

<p>It is curious that in the first four Beatitudes, the one to be blessed is described as deficient in something desirable which the Lord promises they will one day receive. They are poor, mournful, meek, hungry and thirsty. In the last three, the blessed one possesses an admirable character quality but is promised something even greater. This indicates that the person is on a quest and they are making progress toward maturity.</p>

<p>That quest is to reap a spiritual harvest and the crop is named in the sixth blessing. The goal of that harvest is the impossible desire that drove Moses on: to see the face of God and live.</p>

<p>Each blessing matches its corresponding phase in the <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>. Collectively, these seven constitute the heart that a determined harvester must have if they are to fulfill Jesus’ command to make disciples of all nations. Before we see how this all fits together, there is a longer process of salvation at work: the path to glory.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ordo Salutis</em>: Nine steps from Dishonor to Glory</h2>

<p>Every denomination has its own way to describe the process of salvation, with much overlap.
The order presented here is closest to that taught by Reformed churches; in my list two Reformed steps are omitted (Predestination and Election)
and one step (Adoption) is shifted by one position. The sequences presented by all denominations are the product of complex theological systems. 
To my knowledge, none of these systems offer up a single Bible passage in which this order may be observed.
Instead, they have composed it by drawing upon passages scattered throughout the Bible, applying logic and also factoring in key insights from
their denominational system. In this article, an <em>Ordo Salutis</em> will be described and defended from but two passages: 
Psalm 19 and Matthew 5:3-11. </p>

<p>Why is this significant? You don't need a fancy system based on human logic and many assumptions
to derive the plan of salvation. You only need the words of Jesus. Also, these are not just any words.
Before delivering the Beatitudes, Jesus in Matthew has only uttered six sentences. One was to insist that John baptize him.
Three were addressed to the devil. One was to call people to repent. The sixth one was to call Simon and Andrew to be his disciples.
Thus these Beatitudes are Jesus' first major teaching. Isn't it fitting that they tell people, step by step, the way to be saved?</p>

<p>Both passages have all nine steps. The only difference between these two passages is that
Adoption falls between Perseverance and Glorification in Psalm 19 and between Sanctification and Perseverance in Matthew 5.
Since the reference to Adoption in Psalm 19 is subtle and appears in the same verse as the references to perseverance and glory,
the clear and unambiguous listing of Matthew will be considered definitive. Here is that order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calling</li>
<li>Regeneration</li>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Repentance</li>
<li>Justification</li>
<li>Sanctification</li>
<li>Adoption</li>
<li>Perseverance</li>
<li>Glorification</li>
</ol>

<p>By combining Psalm 19 and Matthew 5, we will see that the Bible tells a simple story. 
King David prayed in Psalm 19 for the Lord to save him.
Then Jesus answered in the Beatitudes by telling us the way of salvation.</p>

<p>The Bible also tells a more complicated story. The world as nations and peoples and a suffering church
has also cried out for someone to show them the way of salvation on a larger scale than just individuals. 
Jesus has told us how he will save that part of the world that turns to him in faith. 
The Beatitudes prophesy ten eras in the history of the church. Each Beatitude shouts the cry for help of one era 
in the history of the church. The blessing in that Beatitude names the relief that the Lord promised to send in the following era.
The final beatitude prophesies a blessed tenth time when there will be no more suffering, and that will be when Jesus returns.</p>

<p>As for David, his very prayer was a prophecy that can be used to identify the one who would answer it.
Before we get to that, though, let's perform some accounting.</p>

<h2>Numbering the Beatitudes</h2>

<p>To emphasize the cooperation yet distinct roles of the persons of the Trinity, many Bible passages are phrased so as to highlight the numbers
that correspond to each person, or the Law, or some other concept. The Beatitudes of Matthew 5 are so structured.</p>

<p><strong>The Son</strong>. First, each beatitude names a class of suffering person and then pronounces a blessing upon them. The alternation
of suffering, blessing, suffering, blessing shouts the number two. <a href="./2-is-for-jesus.html">Two</a> stands for Jesus,
who has two natures (divine and human), as the divine Logos is divided into two Testaments, Old and New, 
will come to earth twice, and whose suffering on the cross is the cause of all blessings that accrue to believers.</p>

<p><strong>The Spirit</strong>. Second, the first seven Beatitudes form a <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>, as first noted in the chapter "A Minute Look at Matthew" in
<em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. The number <a href="./7-is-for-the-holy-spirit.html">seven</a> stands for the Holy Spirit. 
Acquiring and believing the blessing of the seventh Beatitude, becoming adopted into God's family as a son of God, 
is a most critical step. This blessing is specially associated by Paul with action of the Holy Spirit: </p>

<h4>For you did not receive the spirit of slavery</h4>

<h4>to fall back into fear, but you have received</h4>

<h4>the <strong>Spirit of adoption as sons</strong>, by whom we cry,</h4>

<h5>“Abba! Father!”</h5>

<h6>- Romans 8:15</h6>

<p><strong>The Father</strong>. Third, there are nine beatitudes, which is three times three, with <a href="./3-is-for-the-father.html">three</a> being the number for the Father.
When we consider how the Beatitudes reveal the Order of Salvation, it will be apparent that there are three phases, describing our relationship to the Father in each state. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Seeker</strong>. The first three Beatitudes are about a seeker hearing the call to faith.</li>
<li><strong>Servant</strong>. The second three Beatitudes are about living as a servant under discipline in God's house, repentant, forgiven, and on the road to sanctification.</li>
<li><strong>Son</strong>. The third three Beatitudes are about living in glorious freedom as a son (or daughter) of God.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each triplet of Beatitudes and their corresponding step toward salvation has one devoted to each member of the Trinity:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Son <strong>calls</strong>, the Spirit <strong>regenerates</strong>, and the Father grants <strong>faith</strong></li>
<li>The Son teaches the prayer of <strong>repentance</strong>, the Father <strong>justifies</strong>, and the Spirit <strong>sanctifies</strong></li>
<li>The Father <strong>adopts</strong>, the Spirit enables <strong>perseverance</strong>, and the Son <strong>glorifies</strong> - <em>when he comes on that day to be <strong>glorified</strong> in his saints</em> (2 Thessalonians 1:10)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Law</strong>. Fourth, though there are nine Beatitudes, the last one is extra long. Each Beatitude corresponds to one of the Ten Commandments, 
but the last one matches two (against lying and covetousness). This begins the transformation of a law that brings death into one the brings eternal life.</p>

<p>From the preceding, we can conclude that it is specifically the Trinitarian God that saves people, with all three persons cooperating seamlessly 
in the process.</p>

<p>Now that we have introduced two key structures in the Beatitudes, the Harvest Pattern and the Ordo Salutis, it is time for a deep dive.
The rest of this article will show, verse by verse, how these ideas connect to the passage and what that means for Christians.
So back we go to the Harvest Pattern.</p>

<h2>The Harvest Pattern of the Beatitudes</h2>

<p>As a refresher, the Harvest Pattern has these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation (of faith in the Lord and respect for the Law)</li>
<li>Plowing (of Suffering)</li>
<li>Planting Seeds (of Gospel truth by the Son)</li>
<li>Pouring Water (of the Holy Spirit)</li>
<li>Plucking Weeds (as discipline from the Father)</li>
<li>Producing a Harvest</li>
<li>Peace</li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern is defined by Jesus in Matthew. It is employed structurally at least seventeen times in Matthew, from the overall outline
of the whole book to the structure of short passages. The pattern's most complete realization is the overall structure of the Book of Job.</p>
