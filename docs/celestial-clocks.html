        <h1>Celestial Clocks</h1>
        
        
        
        <p>Genesis 1 tells us that on the fourth day, God created the sun, moon and stars to govern day and night and regulate days, seasons and years.
They are God's celestial time pieces. These heavenly bodies move through the skies with mechanical precision, the
attribute par excellence of the Celestial Clock. In Solomon's inventory of types of prophetic clocks, they come second, after the generation clocks:</p>

<h4>The sun rises, and the sun goes down,</h4>

<h5>and hastens to the place where it rises.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 1:5</h6>

<p>This article will summarize sections of <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em> and <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em> that were devoted to this type of clock.
It will name each clock, block out the eras of history that it prophesies, point out where in those books it was developed, and (for a few) 
point to an extended treatment in a separate article on this website.</p>

<h2>Creation Clock</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Genesis 1</li>
<li>Defined in: <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em></li>
<li>Chapter(s): Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1</li>
<li>Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD (or later)</li>
<li>Intervals: 7</li>
<li>Period: 1000 years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable facts:</strong></p>

<p>Matches the seven days of creation to important events in the seven millennia of history.
This assumes that history will last no more than seven thousand years before the final judgment and the
establishment of the new heavens and new earth. This clock is similar to the ancient expectation of many theologians which is 
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennial_Day_Theory">Millennial Day Theory</a>. Many Christians combine the idea of the 
millennial reign of Christ with the idea of a thousand year sabbath during the seventh millennium. 
My formulation of eschatology, <strong>Fractal Historicism</strong>, does not. The two events are distinct.
The millennial kingdom of CHrist has already come and gone, having lasted from 380 to 1380 AD in the form of Christian Rome and its extension
through the Byzantine Empire. If the Creation was on or near 4020 BC, then we are already in the early years of the
seventh millennium, yet Christ has not returned. My expectation is that the eternal sabbath will begin during this millennium,
but not immediately. It could start at any time but the present world order may linger for two or three centuries more.</p>

<p>Day 1 of creation (4020-3020 BC) was when God created light and separated the light from the darkness
by alternating day and night. This matches the division of people into two groups, the righteous descendants of Seth
and the corrupt descendants of Cain.</p>

<p>Day 2 of creation (3020-2020 BC) is the only one God did not call good. This
millennium had Noah's flood and the Tower of Babel, the worst calamities in history (so far).</p>

<p>Day 3 of creation (2020-1020 BC) is when God created the dry ground and plants and trees which grow from seeds. 
The ground is the Law of Moses and the seed is the beginning of the writing of God's Word.</p>

<p>Day 4 of creation (1020-20 BC), when God created the sun, moon &amp; stars,
ends within a few years of the birth of the Sun of Righteousness and Morning Star, Jesus.
This millennium was when most of the prophets lived. Prophecy is about revealing God's future plans, interpreting
history and marking out time, just like the heavenly bodies. Solomon lived at the very beginning of this millennium.
His writings provide the temporal framework for understanding the rest of the prophets.</p>

<p>Day 5 of creation (20 BC-980 AD), when the birds were created, corresponds to the Holy Spirit, given at Pentecost, beginning the 5th millennium.
The sea creatures were also created. Leviathan, the great sea serpent is first given expression in the form of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Day 6 of creation (980-1980 AD) saw the creation of the beasts and man. The sixth millennium spans the period during which mankind's knowledge grew fastest.</p>

<p>Day 7 of creation (1980 AD-?) will usher in the sabbath rest, when Christ returns.</p>

<h2>Temple Dedication Clocks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: 1 Kings 8:62–63</li>
<li>Defined in: <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em></li>
<li>Chapter(s): Psalm 119: The Shepherd’s Clock</li>
<li>Timespan: 4020 BC–39 AD, 960 BC–1680 AD</li>
<li>Intervals: 22</li>
<li>Period: 120 years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable facts:</strong></p>

<p>When Solomon dedicated the temple, the quantity of
animals sacrificed used the numbers twenty-two (22) and
one hundred twenty (120). If you start the clock at the
creation and allow Adam and Methuselah their longer
generations, the 22nd generation ends in 39 AD, shortly
after Christ sacrificed his life for our sins on the cross.
Combined with the Psalm 119 clock which defines the
birth of Christ before 19 AD, you can derive a range for
the crucifixion of 19–39 AD!</p>

<p>If you instead start the clock from the temple dedication
in 960 BC, the 22nd generation ends in 1680 AD. This
final generation was the beginning of the Scientific
Revolution and the age of Reason. Solomon, the wisest
non-divine man in history, pointed to the era where
humanity’s earthly wisdom would explode.</p>

<h2>Solomon’s Celestial Clock</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</li>
<li>Defined in: <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em></li>
<li>Chapters: 
<ul>
<li>Solomon’s Celestial Clock,</li>
<li>Solomon’s End Times</li>
<li>Solomon’s Sundial</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)</li>
<li>Intervals: 28</li>
<li>Period: 120 years (per “time”)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable facts:</strong></p>

<p>This is the most fundamental prophetic clock in the Bible.
It is the scaffolding that allows the others to be fit into a coherent and consistent framework.
That makes it the mainspring of God's prophetic clocks.</p>

<p>By assigning a single word to each generation, Solomon revealed the principal spiritual forces at work from the
dedication of the temple in 960 BC until the day the Lord ushers in eternal peace. His choice of words? Impeccable.
Here are the key events that occurred in half the twenty-eight times:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A time to die</em>: Northern kingdom of Israel carried into captivity by Assyria.</li>
<li><em>A time to plant</em>: Prosperous times for Judah under King Hezekiah.</li>
<li><em>A time to uproot</em>: The Babylonian Exile of Judah uproots the Jews from their homeland.</li>
<li><em>A time to kill</em>: Attempted genocide of all the Jews by Haman in the Book of Esther.</li>
<li><em>A time to weep</em>: The Crucifixion of Jesus.</li>
<li><em>A time to mourn</em>: Roman persecution of Christians peaks under Diocletian.</li>
<li><em>A time to dance</em>: Rome becomes a Christian empire! Edict of Thessalonica issued in 380 AD.</li>
<li><em>A time to throw away</em>: Byzantium abandoned to its fate.</li>
<li><em>A time to tear</em>: Protestant Reformation &amp; civil war tears the church apart.</li>
<li><em>A time to mend</em>: Dawn of Religious freedom and tolerance.</li>
<li><em>A time to be silent</em>: Christians listen to God during the Pietism Movement, Methodist Revival &amp; Great Awakening.</li>
<li><em>A time to speak</em>: Great age of Christian missions.</li>
<li><em>A time to love</em>: Worldwide increase in health &amp; prosperity and Israel reborn.</li>
<li><em>A time to hate</em>: Worldwide persecution of Christians and Jews will soon begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>The power of this clock is that it operates at different scales of time and on different levels of being.
It structures the history of...</p>

<ul>
<li>a single person via the <a href="./growth-pattern.md">Growth Pattern</a>.</li>
<li>ancient Israel and the church as a unity via this clock</li>
<li>the secular world from the Creation until the end (via another clock)</li>
<li>modern Israel (via a clock in "Appendix C: A Time for Israel" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>It structures the levels of...</p>

<ul>
<li>existence in the material world that Solomon calls life "under the sun"</li>
<li>existence in the spiritual world, as explained by Jesus in Matthew the Apostle Paul in his first seven letters</li>
</ul>

<p>As illustrations of the spiritual dimension of Solomon's times:</p>

<ul>
<li>A time to be born is being "born again"</li>
<li>A time to die is dying to self and gaining a new identity in Christ, as in Romans 6 and Galatians 2</li>
<li>A time to plant is being baptized into the fellowship of the church</li>
<li>A time to uproot is severing some ties with non-believers following salvation</li>
</ul>

<p>With Solomon's times woven into so much of the material and spiritual order of the world, this means that
prophecy is also deeply personal. Neglecting its study is unwise.</p>

<h2>Solomon’s Son-dial</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Ecclesiastes 1–10</li>
<li>Defined in: <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em></li>
<li>Chapters:
<ul>
<li>Solomons Sundial,</li>
<li>The Time of Her Confinement,</li>
<li>Rightly Dividing the Words</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)</li>
<li>Intervals: 28 (divided by the phrase “under the sun”)</li>
<li>Period: 120 years</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable facts:</strong></p>

<p>Almost a decade ago, I turned my attention to Ecclesiastes. I wrote a program that tallied how often each word and short phrase
was used. The obvious result was that "under the sun" was Solomon's catch phrase. My clumsy research concluded that 
the structure and interpretation of Ecclesiastes was tied up in two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The poem of the twenty-eight times</li>
<li>The phrase "under the sun", which also appears twenty-eight times</li>
</ul>

<p>It seemed sensible to ask, "Is the list of times a table of contents into the book?" I tried to map those words to
the content of the rest of the book and failed. Also, the phrase "under the sun" is distributed haphazardly.
It appears in one verse twice and in some chapters not at all, including the books two concluding chapters.
I soon abandoned my effort and would not return to Ecclesiastes until 2020. The sad thing is that I was right. 
I had correctly identified the two features of the book whose relationship you must understand in order to solve the riddles of its meaning.
I just didn't know what to do with them.</p>

<p>The twenty-eight times are not a table of contents into Ecclesiastes. They are a table of contents into a human life.
Ecclesiastes is a treatise on the stages of a human life, but some of the "times" are not addressed there.
They are however, addressed in Psalms, Proverbs, Matthew and the other <a href="./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a>.</p>

<p>As for the placement of the instances of "under the sun", that was subtle. They are the tick marks on a prophetic sundial. 
Even though they are spaced unevenly, they do divide the book into twenty-eight pieces and each piece does correspond to
one of the twenty-eight times, in sequence. Then the verses between the tick marks contains prophesies that point to events
in the matching era of history. That is why Ecclesiastes is so hard to understand! It is a rundown of all history from 
the dedication of the temple until Christ returns. By combining the time phrase and the words in the bracketed passage
you can understand part of God's plan for history and how it is all developed from an analogy to the life of a single person.</p>

<p>Here are where the "under the sun" references are found in Ecclesiastes and which time goes with each:</p>

<ul>
<li>1:3 Born</li>
<li>1:9 Die</li>
<li>1:14 Plant</li>
<li>2:11 Uproot</li>
<li>2:17 Kill</li>
<li>2:18 Heal</li>
<li>2:19 Tear down</li>
<li>2:20 Build</li>
<li>2:22 Weep</li>
<li>3:16 Laugh</li>
<li>4:1 Mourn</li>
<li>4:3 Dance</li>
<li>4:7 Scatter stones</li>
<li>4:15 Gather stones</li>
<li>5:13 Embrace</li>
<li>5:18 Refrain</li>
<li>6:1 Search</li>
<li>6:12 Give up</li>
<li>8:9 Keep</li>
<li>8:15 Throw away</li>
<li>8:17 Tear</li>
<li>9:3 Mend</li>
<li>9:6 Be Silent</li>
<li>9:9 Speak, Love</li>
<li>9:11 Hate</li>
<li>9:13 War</li>
<li>10:5 Peace</li>
</ul>

<p>The subtlest riddle in the Bible is hidden in “a thousand years twice over” in Ecclesiastes 6:6, whose answer gives us 120 years
as the length of one of Solomon’s “times”. The solving of that riddle is the subject of <a href="./twice-a-thousand-years.html">Twice a Thousand Years</a>.</p>

<p>A few interesting prophecies that fall out of the book are: </p>

<ol>
<li>On the “sun-dial”, the poem of the twenty-eight times occurs during “a time to weep” – when Jesus died for our sins, marking
that the most important of times.</li>
<li>Verse 9:9 says “meaningless” and “under the sun” twice and has the book’s only positive use of “love”. It falls on “a time to speak” and “a time to love”, season of God’s greatest outpouring of mercy upon the world and the greatest era of overseas Christian missions.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the chapter "Solomon's Sundial", the placement of the "under the sun" usages was also used as a scaffold to study the distribution of other common phrases throughout the book. One example should suffice. It is the word "wind" which is often used to indicate futility as in "chasing after the wind".</p>

<h3>Wind</h3>

<p>Wind can mean “spirit”. The King James uses “vexation of spirit” in place of “chasing after the wind”.
The impossibilities of catching the wind, containing it, or
stopping its repetitive cycles are all conveyed by
Ecclesiastes. The endless cycle is introduced in 1:6 with 
<em>“The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.”</em> 
Then the futility of chasing it is found all over. Since we can’t take anything
with us when we die, 5:6 says we “toil for the wind”. In 8:8
we are reminded that we can’t hold onto our spirit and so
overcome death by the words “no one has power over the
wind to contain it...” The final mentions describe the
mysteriousness of the wind:</p>

<h4>“Whoever watches the <strong>wind</strong> will not plant;</h4>

<h5>whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.</h5>

<h4>As you do not know the path of the <strong>wind</strong>,</h4>

<h5>or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb,</h5>

<h4>so you cannot understand the work of God,</h4>

<h5>the Maker of all things."</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 11:4-5, NIV</h6>

<p>It is no mystery which verses speak of the wind:</p>

<p><strong>1:6,14,17; 2:11,17,26; 4:4,6,16; 5:16; 6:9; 8:8; 11:4-5</strong></p>

<p>If the phrase occurs in a verse that falls between a pair of
“under the sun” verses, we will assume the “wind” phrase
is relevant to both corresponding “times”. If the phrase is
in the same verse as “under the sun”, we only match it with
one time.</p>

<p>For example, 1:6 includes “wind” and falls between 1:3
(born) and 1:9 (die), so it will be assigned both <em>born</em> and <em>die</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 1:14 has both “under the sun” and
“chasing after the wind”, so it is only assigned the time
“plant”.</p>

<p>If you continue this for all fourteen “wind” verses, you
will collectively match seventeen of the times. You can
rationalize good reasons for each match, such as terrible
defeats or the destruction of the temple, but the clearest,
simplest story that they tell may only be inferred by looking
at the times that were NOT matched. Those unmatched
times are the the sundial’s shadow. They are clumped into
three groups of adjacent times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heal, Tear down, Build</li>
<li>Mourn</li>
<li>Throw away, Tear, Mend, Be silent, Speak, Love, Hate, War</li>
</ul>

<p>What distinguishes these three periods of history from
the rest? Satan. The three times in the first group span the
silent years between the two testaments, when there were
no prophets to add to the Word of God, the darkest time for
Israel. That means the Spirit (the wind) was not at work
sending authoritative messages to Israel to add to the Bible.
The second group has one time, the time of the worst of
the Roman persecutions, under Diocletian. This is what
Revelation has to say about that time:</p>

<h4>I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich!</h4>

<h4>I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews</h4>

<h4>and are not, but are a synagogue of <strong>Satan</strong>.</h4>

<h4>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer.</h4>

<h4>I tell you, the <strong>devil</strong> will put some of you in prison</h4>

<h4>to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days.</h4>

<h4>Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will</h4>

<h4>give you life as your victor’s crown.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 2:9-10, NIV</h6>

<p>After that, there is a long stretch where wind appears
repeatedly. The millennium from “a time to dance” through
“a time to keep” constitutes the thousand years that Satan
was bound, between the Edict of Thessalonica and the
commencement of the long period of Ottoman sieges
against Constantinople, leading to its fall. The Spirit blew
freely during those years and experienced limited Satanic
opposition while the church grew.</p>

<p>After Satan was unbound, chaos ensued. Byzantium fell.
The Reformation split the church and led to centuries of
religious wars. More recently, the devil has deceived the
nations; apostasy has spread, as formerly Christian nations
abandon the faith. From “a time to throw away” to “a time
to hate” (in our near future), the wind is absent again. That
will end when history reaches “a time of war”. Christ will
return in the middle or end of that time, and the Holy Spirit
will complete his mission as well, as is revealed in
Revelation:</p>

<h4>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain,</h4>

<h4>standing at the center of the throne, encircled by</h4>

<h4>the four living creatures and the elders.</h4>

<h4>The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the</h4>

<h4><strong>seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 5:6, NIV</h6>

<p>Lest there be confusion, the Holy Spirit has never nor
will ever be entirely absent from this world. What the
preceding shows is that the balance of influence between
the Holy Spirit and Satan’s evil spirits has shifted over time,
first one way then the other. As the final two occurrences of
“wind” attest, we “do not know the path of the wind”.</p>

<h2>Lamps of the Ten Virgins</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Matthew 25</li>
<li>Chapter: The Time of Her Confinement</li>
<li>Timespan: 1–2280 AD</li>
<li>Intervals: 10</li>
<li>Period: 240 years (per lamp)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable facts:</strong></p>

<p>In this parable from Matthew 25, ten virgins are to wait for the Bridegroom to arrive for the wedding.
When he arrives, they are to meet him with lamps lit, attend to his needs
and make the final preparations for the wedding. However, the Bridegroom is long in coming.
The five foolish virgins did not plan for this and had run out of oil for their lamps.
While they are at the market buying more oil, the Bridegroom arrives and the wedding starts.
When they return, they are barred from entering the wedding and lose their right to participate
in the festivities.</p>

<p>When interpreted as a celestial clock, this parable assumes the clock began with Solomon but that
we can skip over the first eight times, which is four seasons. That is because Jesus ascended to heaven
(hence is the Bridegroom who went away until it was time for the wedding) during the ninth time,
a time to weep. From "a time to weep" to "a time for peace" is twenty times or equivalently ten seasons.</p>

<p>With that understood, each virgin with a lamp stands for one of Solomon’s “seasons”, which is
made up of two 120-year “times”. During five of those ten seasons, women of the church were prepared, 
including the current season. One ill-prepared season remains. All told, the women of the church
were prepared during these seasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Season 5: a time to weep and a time to laugh (1-240 AD)</li>
<li>Season 6: a time to mourn and a time to dance (240-480 AD)</li>
<li>Season 11: a time to tear and a time to mend (1440-1680 AD)</li>
<li>Season 12: a time to be silent and a time to speak (1680-1920 AD)</li>
<li>Season 13: a time to love and a time to hate (1920-2160 AD)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the beginning of the church, women were the first to see the risen Christ, participated actively 
in running churches in their homes and assisting in missionary efforts.
During the years when the women of the church were not prepared, whose fault was that?
Women were progressively excluded from positions in the church from 360-480 AD.
Then on the other side, the Protestant Reformation promoted the priesthood of all believers.
Protestant schools taught women to read and they slowly began to progress towards equality.</p>

<p>Why should we conclude that this parable is about whether the church respects and trains up
women for service? The parable has many layers of meaning. On the surface, a wise or foolish virgin is
an individual Christian, male or female, who has taken initiative to prepare for the return of Christ
through learning the doctrines of the faith and obeying them conscientiously through acts of service.
On a higher level, it is whole churches, since Revelation tells us that lamp stands stand for churches. 
On the highest level, it is whole eras of the church age, when the church as a whole was either prepared
or not. The identification of the preparedness or unpreparedness of women is offered as a single, identifiable
sign and symptom of the church's condition. It does not represent the whole of the problems that each age faced.</p>

<p>The parable does not tell us which church ages were prepared or not. For that we must add in information from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Church history</li>
<li>Other prophecies, like the letters to the Seven Churches in Revelation</li>
</ul>

<p>The chapter "Seven Churches for Seven Eras" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em> matches the seven named churches
to seven eras of history. The churches that Jesus mostly praised can be identified with the prepared virgins.
The churches that Jesus had the harshest criticism for can be identified with the foolish virgins.
Those seven eras are not uniform in length, but by placing them alongside the ten seasons of this parable,
you will find that the praised church eras constitute half of church history.</p>

<p>In the following chart, two thirds of the way down the image are two rows labeled "Ten Virgins" and "Letters to the Seven Churches".
The blocks labeled "YES" are the eras when the church was prepared. These are those prepared church ages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ephesus (33-100 AD)</li>
<li>Smyrna (100-313 AD)</li>
<li>Pergamum (313-550 AD) Only the first third or so of this era was prepared. As the era progressed, the acceptable roles of women were progressively diminished by popes and councils.</li>
<li>Philadelphia (1453-1990 AD)</li>
<li>Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The church will be prepared during the first half of this, our current era, but steadily lose ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>The unprepared church eras were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pergamum (313-550 AD) The second two-thirds of the era.</li>
<li>Thyatira (550-964 AD) The whole era.</li>
<li>Sardis (964-1453 AD) The whole era.</li>
<li>Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The second half of the era.</li>
</ul>

<p>A time of darkness will one day come when no one can work. The time of war will 
test us all. Will women be prepared for this? Will men?</p>
