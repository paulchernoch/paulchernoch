        <h1>The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program</h1>
        
        
        
        <h2>Buried in the Noise</h2>

<p>For a decade or more, I taught Sunday School. I knew a lot about the Bible and Christianity, so
I was never at a loss for something to teach. Nevertheless, I didn't have any idea whether I was 
overlooking important topics. Did my lessons have gaps? If I were to disciple an adult, would
I be able to present the whole gospel?</p>

<p>The church has experts in systematic theology. Denominations create creeds, catechisms, lesson plans 
and curricula to assist. You can get lost in it all. I know I did. Wouldn't it be nice if the Bible 
were more systematic instead of historical and all over the map? The arrangement of stories and ideas
is almost as messy as my tool shed!</p>

<p>It was while studying Job for my book on resilience that I detected the first hidden sign of coherence.
Sprinkled among his nine speeches, Job issued a series of pleas, setting forth all the qualities he needed in a savior. While researching that book I found eight; a ninth turned up while I was preparing my book on Ecclesiastes. 
Those nine requirements I called Job's "job requirements for a savior". They not only fit Jesus to a T, 
they matched nine events in the Lord's ministry <strong>in chronological order</strong>.</p>

<p>That is systematic. A careful student of Job will therefore come to understand the many dimensions of salvation.
Of course, different denominations argue about the <em>Ordo Salutis</em>, or order of salvation. 
Which parts of the process happen in which sequence? To answer that question you need to wade into another 
round of scholarly debates. Much to my surprise, when studying Psalm 19 for <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, 
I was stunned to discover the whole order of salvation present. (In other parts of the Bible, only a few steps
are listed. That is why it is a puzzle to fit them all together.) That Psalm 19 order comes closest to matching 
the Reformed sequence, but when you compare the two, one item is out of place. I am putting my money on Psalm 19.
(See the chapter "Psalm 19: The Glory of God's Law" for the analysis.)</p>

<p>What about sanctification? What must you teach a new convert to bring them to full maturity in the faith?
Better yet, do you know if you know all that <strong>you</strong> should know to consider yourself fully mature?
Where is the checklist? Years of reading Christian books, hearing sermons, attending seminars and classes, 
studying the Bible, and putting it into practice always and only gave me a single expectation.
The Bible has all the answers, but leave it to the experts to mine it for silver and gold and package it
for you in a best seller.</p>

<p>The experts must have overlooked Solomon - and Paul.</p>

<p>As I saw the pieces of Lady Wisdom's house start to assemble before my mind, interlocking perfectly,
I saw where Paul's letters should fit - as the roof of peace - but I saw little structure to them. 
The letters to Timothy were my first break. They were structured both by the commandments (the Law Pattern) 
and by the Growth Pattern. What of the other letters? I had no clue, until that recent evening when I
was lying on the couch, coughing and wheezing. Without a Bible or pen and paper in front of me,
in the dark, feeling miserable, it all became so clear. It can't have been my doing; it must
have been another gift.</p>

<p>The structure was so simple that I never would have thought of it. Sure, I spotted the Growth Pattern
in Matthew's Gospel, but that was a single document written by a single hand who set it all in order.
Paul's letters were partly collaborative, being dictated to a scribe, and they were written over the 
course of decades, then inserted into the Bible in order by descending length. By length? How random! 
There was no reason to expect that the current order was THE intended order. 
It was too easy, too perfect. Surely if the first seven letters of Paul were set in their current order 
on purpose to follow a special pattern, someone besides me would have noticed it before now!</p>

<p>Spiritual growth. Sanctification is all about growing up to the measure and stature of Christ.
Naturally, theologians look to the gospels and Paul's letters for the details, as they should.
I got lost in those details for years. So many topics are covered in Paul's letters. Teasing the signal 
out of the noise is hard. That is where Solomon is necessary. He tells us almost nothing BUT
the structure. He omits the content and lists the steps in his twenty-eight times. 
Only by laying out his times, by fours, and matching them to Paul's letters can you at last see
the beauty and simplicity of what Solomon, Paul and the Holy Spirit have done.</p>

<h1>A Course for Disciples</h1>

<p>To gain a basic grasp of all the steps in the process of sanctification, all you have to do
is read Paul's first seven letters in the order they appear in most Bibles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Romans</li>
<li>1 Corinthians</li>
<li>2 Corinthians</li>
<li>Galatians</li>
<li>Ephesians</li>
<li>Philippians</li>
<li>Colossians</li>
</ul>

<p>Those letters are your basic discipleship class. Solomon created the course syllabus and
Paul wrote the lecture materials. There are seven stages of growth. Since Solomon was
the wisest man who ever lived (besides Jesus), we know he didn't miss any steps.
This course of study it therefore objectively complete, lacking nothing.</p>

<p>Since spiritual truths are difficult to master, every step has supplemental material 
to aid in comprehension and mastery:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Support</strong>. Each phase is supported by a matching psalm, to help the student find emotional strength to breakthrough.</li>
<li><strong>Grief Counseling</strong>. Each phase is supported by a matching chapter from Job, to help the student overcome past traumas that impair progress as well as build an ethical core.</li>
<li><strong>Career Counseling</strong>. Each phase is supported by a matching chapter from Proverbs, to help supply motivation and advice on surviving in the marketplace.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Counseling</strong>. Each phase is supported by a passage from the Song of Songs to help with the loneliness and confusion of not understanding the proper timing in dating and romance.</li>
<li><strong>Life Coaching</strong>. Each phase is supported by a passage in Ecclesiastes on how to plan for the big picture.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Mentoring</strong>. Each phase is supported by a chapter in Matthew where the Savior of the universe has words of wisdom and comfort to impart.</li>
<li><strong>Crisis Management</strong>. Every phase is supported by a section in Revelation with advice on how to overcome the worst crises imaginable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above correspondences are described in detail in my books, but summarized in a table in <a href="./there-is-a-season.html">There is a Season</a>. The rest of this article will supply the proof that Paul's letters really do
conform to the Growth Pattern.</p>

<h4>for the marriage of the Lamb has come,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>his Bride has made herself ready</strong>;</h5>

<h5>with fine linen, bright and pure—</h5>

<h4>for the fine linen is</h4>

<h5>the righteous deeds of the saints.</h5>
