        <h1>Types of Clock</h1>
        
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-06-03</p>
        
        <p>The majority of this article is lifted from the chapter "Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.
It names and describes several type of prophetic clock. </p>

<p>Many scholars have turned to the Bible in search of prophecies and then attempted to decipher them. 
This task is complicated because who knows what to expect? What are the ways that God structures his messages? 
Do we know them all? Did He tell us that or have we tried to figure it out on our own?</p>

<p>A decade ago I found a pattern in world history that matched a pattern I saw in the Bible. I saw the Bible introduce ideas about
the progress of civilization in one order, then I saw more recent history exhibit the same concepts in reverse order.
Programmers call this a LIFO stack, which means "Last In, First Out". 
Was I right about the history pattern? The Bible pattern? Both? What warrant did I have from Scripture that such a pattern 
ought to be found in the Bible at all? I had no such confidence, so I abandoned the effort and set my spreadsheet full of correlations aside.</p>

<p>Years later, I began to study Ecclesiastes. My ideas about history surfaced again and again I pushed them aside.
I told God I would proceed no further in my study without some assurance that such a pattern could be found in Scripture.
Note that I was not asking God whether my ideas were right, that I had picked the right set of ancient Bible events and the right
set of modern historical events and matched them up to tell a meaningful story of progress. I was asking whether there was any place 
in the Bible where an idea resembling my LIFO idea could be found. If God never causes history to progress according to such a sequence,
then I had certainly NOT found a true and useful idea about history.</p>

<p>So that was what I told God. What did He tell me? He told me to reread Ecclesiastes 1. Well, not in so many words.
The Holy Spirit does not speak to me with audible words but with meaning. A few days later when I reread chapter 1 for my own reasons, 
I found what I was looking for. The words were the same, but my mind was now illuminated. The words were also exactly where they ought
to be in a treatise on time: at the beginning. They were hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>In what follows, I catalogue five types of clocks from the words in Ecclesiastes 1. I would later find that
the one that began my search is a sixth. The symmetric pattern of history where events proceed in one order then repeat in reverse is given here:</p>

<h5><strong>What has been will be again</strong>,</h5>

<h5><strong>what has been done will be done again</strong>;</h5>

<h5>there is nothing new under the sun.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 1:9, NIV</h6>

<p>I call this pattern the Cosmic Chiasm. I first wrote of this idea in an Appendix in <em>Job Rises</em>. 
A Chiasm is a poetic form where ideas proceed in one order then repeat in reverse order.
It is also called symmetric parallelism.</p>

<ul>
<li>The "what has been" is the first half of the parallel structure.</li>
<li>The "will be done again" is the second half.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my career as a software engineer, I have on several occasions thought up and implemented "new" algorithms
to accomplish my work. Later I would discover that someone else published an article on an identical algorithm decades earlier.
There truly is nothing new under the sun. This frustration at working so hard to do new and creative things only to find
out that others have gone that way before is an existential one. It can provoke powerful emotions of despair and sap you of motivation.
That emotion, a common experience among all peoples and all times, is the force that disguises the amazing truth behind Solomon's words.
It is a potent emotional riddle. By calling this repetition meaningless and futile, Solomon hides this mystery from our sight.
Recovering that meaning is as delightful as the emotion it builds upon is dreary.</p>

<h2>Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1</h2>

<h4>Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher.</h4>

<h4>“Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.”</h4>

<h4>What do people gain from all their labors</h4>

<h4>at which they toil under the sun?</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 1:2-3</h6>

<p>Is the irony of the book’s opening solely God’s joke, or
did Solomon intend it? Few books “under the sun” are as
meaningful as the Book of Ecclesiastes. The clever king gives
us our first clue in verse 3: the sun.</p>

<p>When do we first meet the sun? Genesis. The story of
creation has long triggered speculation about God’s plan for
history. If He built this all in seven days, will He end it in
another seven?</p>

<h4>A thousand years in your sight are like</h4>

<h4>a day that has just gone by,</h4>

<h4>or like a watch in the night.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 90:4, NIV</h6>

<p>After investing much ink in applying the number five to
the pattern of a harvest, let’s widen our focus to seven.
Before plowing, you need to prepare your tools: plow,
yoke, and all the rest. Then after the labor of bringing in
the harvest comes rest. The seven days of creation give us
that, plus something else: a prophecy that explains God’s
overarching purpose during the millennia in which
Solomon lived.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Day one</em>: God created light, matter, &amp; time.
Preparation for the harvest of the world.</li>
<li><em>Day two</em>: God created the sky and separated the
waters. This is the early rain that softens the ground
for plowing.</li>
<li><em>Day three</em>: Dry ground appears and vegetation, too.
This is the sowing of seeds.</li>
<li><em>Day four</em>: The sun, moon and stars are made.
Sunshine makes the plants grow.</li>
<li><em>Day five</em>: God created birds and fish. There were no
weeds or thorns yet! However, Leviathan, the sea
monster that would come to symbolize Satan, was
made that day.</li>
<li><em>Day six</em>: God created the beasts and humankind.
People use animals to gather the harvest.</li>
<li><em>Day seven</em>: On the day of rest, Peace.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>First millennium</strong>. Let’s work our way up to the sun. In
our earlier discussion, everything begins with suffering, the
day of plowing. It needn’t be so. God began by shining his
light. If mankind had walked in the light from the start,
there would be no need for suffering. Instead, we walked in
darkness. The first thousand years of our history witnessed
a descent into evil, from the death of Abel to the death of
Adam, the first man.</p>

<p><strong>Second millennium</strong>. What happened during our second
thousand years? If you read Genesis 1:6-8, about the second
day, it stands out from the rest. It is the only day of which it
was <strong>not</strong> said, “And God saw that it was good.” The second
millennia of our history witnessed the great flood, the
beginning of slavery, and the crisis of the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p><strong>Third millennium</strong>. Our third lap through history was an
improvement. It begins with Abraham, a man of faith. The
life of righteous Job starts off the Bible, and humble Moses
receives the law. This is the day of planting, when the Word
of God begins to be sown.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth millennium</strong>. Which brings us at last to day four:</p>

<h4>And God said,</h4>

<h5>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven</h5>

<h5>to divide the day from the night; and let them</h5>

<h5>be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,</h5>

<h5>and years: And let them be for lights in the</h5>

<h5>firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth:</h5>

<h4>and it was so.</h4>

<h4>And God made two great lights;</h4>

<h5>the greater light to rule the day,</h5>

<h5>and the lesser light to rule the night:</h5>

<h5>he made the stars also.</h5>

<h4>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven</h4>

<h4>to give light upon the earth, And to rule over</h4>

<h4>the day and over the night, and to divide the light</h4>

<h4>from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</h4>

<h4>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</h4>

<h6>- Genesis 1:14-19, KJV</h6>

<p>The sun is shining and the plants are starting to grow.
Day four is when God created his heavenly timepieces for
signs, seasons, days and years. We have already spoken at
length about how in chapter three of Ecclesiastes, the
twenty-eight times follow a lunar cycle. The rest of
Ecclesiastes makes heavy use of the phrase “under the sun”,
beginning in the third verse. Whose birth ushered in this
fourth millennium of human history? Solomon’s!</p>

<p>Just as the purpose of the fourth day of creation was to
regulate time, the purpose of the fourth millennium of
human history was to prophecy the future and declare
before the whole world that Yahweh is sovereign over time.
This is another example of a fractal: a smaller seven of days
fitting within a larger seven of millennia. This millennium
was filled with the great prophets: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,
and Daniel. Tying all their prophecies together into a single
framework was the work of Solomon. Ecclesiastes is the
mainspring of the Bible’s timepiece, and God foreshadowed
it by His very act of creating our world.</p>

<p>Jesus is the Word (seed) of day three and the Sun of
Righteousness (Malachi 4:2) and Bright Morning Star
(Revelation 22:16) of day four. The dawn of his coming was
at the extreme end of day four and beginning of day five.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth millennium</strong>. This epoch of history was the
millennium of the Holy Spirit, the birth of the church.
Spiritually, just as birds were created on day five, so the
Holy Spirit is represented as a dove. Politically, the Roman
Empire was the dominant force, its symbol another bird,
the eagle.</p>

<p><strong>Sixth millennium</strong>. On the sixth day of creation, God
created beasts and men. During the sixth millennium, some
people continue to act like beasts, while others act like men
and women made in God’s image. This is the time for
weeding, removing thorns, and reassessing priorities. God
cursed the soil with thorns in Adam’s day. In our day,
agricultural productivity has soared; indeed industry of all
kinds has progressed to the point where the effects of that
curse are rapidly diminishing. From a materialistic
viewpoint, the world is experiencing the greatest harvest of
all time.</p>

<p><strong>Seventh millennium</strong>. The seventh day is the day of rest.
That is the millennium we recently began (or according to
some, will commence by the end of this century). For
thousands of years, the expectation among theologians
(like Irenaeus, Jerome, and Hippolytus) has been that this
seventh millennium will see the consummation of the ages,
the coming (or for Christians, the returning) of the Messiah.
Will he come in the beginning (as in Premillennialism)? The
end (as in Amillennialism)? Or somewhere in the middle?
Nobody knows. Jesus is the Word, but that word the
Father has not yet spoken.</p>

<h3>Sequential Prophecies</h3>

<p>We have established that there are sequential, prophetic
passages in the Bible as regular as a clock. Not all such
sequences are clocks and not all prophecies that look like
they are in a sequence are. Let’s explore this distinction
further.</p>

<p>In my experience, new believers absorb the prophetic
content of the Bible haphazardly. Individual prophecies are
tied by preachers to individual historical events. There is
no sequence to it, with exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pharaoh’s dream of sleek and skinny cattle</li>
<li>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the statue of gold, silver, bronze and iron, told to Daniel</li>
<li>Daniel’s dream of four beasts: winged lion, bear, leopard, and a terrible beast</li>
<li>Daniel’s vision of the ram and goat</li>
<li>Daniel’s vision of the angel Gabriel and the 70 weeks</li>
<li>Daniel’s vision of the unnamed angel and tales of a future conqueror</li>
<li>The many prophecies of Revelation</li>
</ul>

<p>I was unaware of any besides these. Consequently, I
never looked for them. Thus I was surprised to find a
sequence of eight prophecies about Jesus set in
chronological order while researching Job for my previous
book. Since then, I discovered a ninth in Job. See the
chapter titled “Months of Futility” for the expanded list.</p>

<p>The list of nine prophecies in Job is a prophetic
sequence, but not a clock. The events neither cover a long
stretch of time, nor are spaced evenly in time, nor explain
large political movements or spiritual themes affecting
large numbers of people. Think of it more like a calendar or
a planner.</p>

<p>Sequential prophecies require careful reading. Confusing
and contradictory interpretations of Revelation have been
forwarded by people who ignore the section breaks in
Revelation where one sequence ends and another begins.
Sequences overlap; the Bible shows the same events from
different angles. It hits a milestone, then backs up and
starts again using a different metaphor, whether seals,
trumpets, bowls or something else. People who try to splice
those prophecies end to end into a single chronology make
a mess of the message.</p>

<p>One proviso: different principles govern different types of
clocks. Wouldn’t it be helpful if the Bible listed the different
kinds? Otherwise, we might misunderstand the purposes
and peculiarities of the clocks we find, or find kinds of
clocks put there not by God but our own imagination.</p>

<h3>The Clocks</h3>

<p>Backing up to Solomon on day four of the world’s history
is in order. If anyone catalogued those prophetic clocks, it
would be him. Let’s see if we can’t find that inspirational
inventory.</p>

<h4><strong>Generations</strong> come and generations go,</h4>

<h5>but the <strong>earth</strong> remains forever.</h5>

<h4>The sun rises and the sun sets,</h4>

<h5>and hurries back to where it rises.</h5>

<h4>The <strong>wind</strong> blows to the south</h4>

<h5>and turns to the north;</h5>

<h5>round and round it goes,</h5>

<h5>ever returning on its course.</h5>

<h4>All <strong>streams</strong> flow into the <strong>sea</strong>,</h4>

<h5>yet the sea is never full.</h5>

<h5>To the place the <strong>streams</strong> come from,</h5>

<h5>there they return again.</h5>

<h4>All things are <strong>wearisome</strong>,</h4>

<h5>more than one can say.</h5>

<h5>The eye never has enough of seeing,</h5>

<h5>nor the ear its fill of hearing.</h5>

<h5><strong>What has been will be again</strong>,</h5>

<h5><strong>what has been done will be done again</strong>;</h5>

<h5>there is nothing new under the sun.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 1:4-9, NIV</h6>

<p>Earlier we discussed how these verses describe four
independent natural cycles that intersect in the realm of
farming. Man works the soil (the earth from which plants
get their minerals, in verse 4), the sun provides light
needed for photosynthesis (verse 5), the winds supply the
oxygen and CO2 needed for respiration and the formation
of cellulose (verse 6), and the streams and oceans circulate
the water plants need to grow (verse 7). Man employs
earth, fire, air and water in his labor leading to a
wearisome harvest, which he must repeat year after year
(verses 8 and 9).</p>

<h3>Generational clocks</h3>

<p>Years ago, as related in the chapter on numbers, I found
a pattern in Matthew’s genealogy suggesting that all of
human history may be constrained to be forty-two periods
in length, measured not in years, but by human lives
(generations) of potentially unequal length. Fascinating
idea, but where in the Bible does it say God measures
history in generations, much less forty-two of them?</p>

<p>This year I was rewarded with verse 4. 
<em>“Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.”</em> 
Alone, this might mean nothing, but it comes at the head of a list
of five cycles. Four are explicit and the harvest cycle which
combines them is implicit. The connection between a cycle
of generations with “forever” or eternity and the fact that
this cycle is listed first suggests that this is the most
important kind of cycle. We will call this a <em>generational clock</em>.</p>

<p>In subsequent chapters, we will explore generational
clocks in Job, Psalm 119 and the story of Pharaoh’s dream
from Genesis 42.</p>

<h3>Celestial Clocks</h3>

<p>The motion of the earth about the sun in the second
cycle marks off days, seasons and years. We are
accustomed to using celestial clocks for mundane
purposes. Bible prophecies also make use of precise counts
of years. A memorable one was given in Pharaoh’s dream in
Genesis 42. As interpreted by Joseph, seven years of plenty
(seven fat cows) would be followed by seven years of
famine (seven emaciated cows). The Bible contains other
prophecies that foretell, with the same precision as the
motions of the celestial bodies, the exact number of years
until an important event. Among them are prophecies in
Exodus, Ecclesiastes and Matthew.</p>

<h3>Spiritual Clocks</h3>

<p>The third cycle is like the old folk song: the answer is
blowing in the wind. When God brought Adam to life, He
breathed His Spirit into him (Genesis 2:7). Spirit is breath
and wind. As Jesus told Nicodemus:</p>

<h4>“The wind blows wherever it pleases.</h4>

<h4>You hear its sound, but you cannot tell</h4>

<h4>where it comes from or where it is going.</h4>

<h4>So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</h4>

<h6>- John 3:8, NIV</h6>

<p>The Holy Spirit is associated with the number seven, so
the distinguishing feature of spiritual clocks is that they
count things in sevens. However, like the wind, each of the
seven parts may be of a different duration, just as the
movements of weather fronts, hurricanes and
thunderstorms are unpredictable.</p>

<p>Because of this, the expectation that history shall last for
exactly seven millennia should not be held too tightly. The
295
key events in each of these seven “days” of history
occurred sometimes at the beginning of a day (like Solomon
and his meditations on time), sometimes the middle of a
day (like the flood), and sometimes at the end (like the birth
of Christ). Thus, should Christ return during the seventh
day, we cannot tell from this spiritual clock whether that
day is tomorrow or in a thousand years.</p>

<p>Many spiritual clocks are found in Revelation. We will
look at two of them. An important cluster is found in the
historical psalms. In each case, the seven ticks of a spiritual
clock are tending toward some concept of completeness,
whether of holiness or judgment. The seven events are
more likely similar than dissimilar. However, if the seven is
wrapped around a harvest pattern, like in Genesis 1, the
differing characteristics of the phases of the harvest will
shine through.</p>

<h3>Empire Clocks</h3>

<p>Designating the water cycle of 1:7 as “empire clocks”
requires explanation. In ancient mythology, the sea
represents chaos. We use the phrase “a sea of faces” to
describe a crowd. In Revelation, the sea is given special
meaning:</p>

<h4>The dragon stood on the shore of the sea.</h4>

<h4>And I saw a beast coming <strong>out of the sea</strong>.</h4>

<h4>It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns</h4>

<h4>on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 13:1</h6>

<p>This means that the beast, identified by most theologians
with Leviathan from Job, will arise out of the chaotic sea of
unsaved mankind; it will be an empire.</p>

<p>Like the sea collects more and more water from its
tributary streams, empires conquer ever larger numbers of
people. Many Bible prophecies use wild beasts as symbols
for empires. The most notable are found in Job, Daniel and
Revelation.</p>

<p>Empire clocks convey the sequence of political
movements, wars and changes in government, but tell us
little about time. They are qualitative clocks. Nevertheless,
as each empire forecast in Scripture rises and falls, we are
assured that we are progressing toward a predetermined
goal, the arrival of one final kingdom:</p>

<h4>“In the time of those kings, the God of heaven</h4>

<h4>will set up a kingdom  that will never be destroyed,</h4>

<h4>nor will it be left to another people.</h4>

<h4>It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end,</h4>

<h4>but it will  itself endure forever.”</h4>

<h6>- Daniel 2:44, NIV</h6>

<p>The last kingdom will be God’s kingdom.</p>

<h3>Harvest Clocks</h3>

<p>Harvest clocks are characterized by either the number
five (for the shorter harvest pattern) or seven (for the
complete pattern). Like spiritual clocks, the time periods
may be of unequal durations. The five events will tell a
story of growth, of moving toward maturity through the
phases of plowing, planting, pouring, plucking, and
producing a harvest.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between the seven-stage process of
growth (the seven pieces of peace) distilled from the
twenty-eight times of chapter 3 and the five-stage harvest
process. The former describes the normal process of
growth through a person’s life, from infancy to maturity,
along with crises peculiar to each stage. The harvest
process is a template for growth applicable to each crisis at
any stage of life.</p>

<p>The harvest pattern sprang from studying spiritual
warfare and spiritual growth, trying to synthesize a deeper
understanding of the three encounters with Satan, the
structure of Job, and Jesus’ parables. Initially, there was no
hint of any prophetic content. Only when I saw Reitman’s
outline of Ecclesiastes and compared it to my pattern did I
venture to infer a harvest pattern based outline of
Ecclesiastes. Comparing that to the days of creation, I
looked again, and saw that in Ecclesiastes, that pattern was
not just a good way to organize the material, it was a good
way to organize history. The chapter “Winding the Clock”
will study the movements of the harvest clock of
Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>This leaves one more clock, one not found on Solomon’s
list. We introduced it earlier, but it bears closer scrutiny.</p>

<p>What about Satan’s clock?</p>

<p>NOTE: Satan's clock is described in the chapter "The Final Countdown"
in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.</p>
