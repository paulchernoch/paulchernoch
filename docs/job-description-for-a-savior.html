        <h1>Job Description for a Savior</h1>
        
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-04-26</p>
        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This article describes the pivotal discovery that gave me the conviction that extensive, systematic, chronological arrangements of
prophecies exist in the Bible, hidden from view. I made that discovery while studying Job.
In that Old Testament book I found nine prophecies of the coming of Christ arranged in chronological order.
They cover the whole of Christ's life, from pre-incarnate state, to birth, to healing ministry, to death and resurrection, ending at his second coming in glory.
How did I find all this?</p>

<p>While I was researching for my book <em>Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life</em>, I asked one of the best questions I have ever asked.
Every time Job began to sink into despair, what was it about his faith that enabled him to rise up again in hope?</p>

<h4>Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;</h4>

<h5>do no violence to his home;</h5>

<h4><strong>for the righteous falls seven times and rises again</strong>,</h4>

<h5>but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 24:15-16</h6>

<p>I went through all of his speeches and pulled out the signs of hope. What I saw opened up much of the meaning and mystery of
the Book of Job to me. In each speech, Job listed another one of his problems (or two!) and set them before God.
He knew he did not have the strength to save himself and said as much. He pleaded with God to save him.
Collectively, these complaints are his "job description" for a savior. This was the list of everything a savior would
have to do to restore his life. It was like Job was interviewing candidates. There is only one person in history
who has ever met all those qualifications. Without knowing it, Job was describing Jesus.</p>

<p>In that book I discovered eight requirements. When I wrote <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, I found a ninth. 
Here is the chapter "Months of Futility" from that second book. 
Note that this article makes frequent references to other chapters from those books. 
However, those chapters are not needed to understand the "job description" analysis at the heart of this article.</p>

<h2>Months of Futility</h2>

<p>Amphigory is beautiful verse of profound apparent
meaning that conceals meaningless nonsense. It is
Lewis Carroll as prophet and Jabberwocky as
scripture. Ecclesiastes is anti-amphigory. Behind a pretense
of futility and the methodical deconstruction of every
mortal purpose sings a potent song. Job sings his own song,
but conceals his meaning beneath suffering.</p>

<h4>“Do not mortals have hard service on earth?</h4>

<h4>Are not their days like those of hired laborers?</h4>

<h4>Like a slave longing for the evening shadows,</h4>

<h4>or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,</h4>

<h4>so I have been allotted <strong>months of futility</strong>,</h4>

<h4>and nights of misery have been assigned to me.</h4>

<h4>When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’</h4>

<h4>The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.</h4>

<h6>- (Job 7:1-4, NIV)</h6>

<h2>Overcoming Obstacles to Understanding</h2>

<p>Over six months of study elapsed before I found my first
prophecy in Job, when Job said that God “treads on the
waves of the sea”, where he foretold Jesus walking on water.
I lost count when I reached sixty prophecies. Space does
not permit us to repeat them all here.</p>

<p>What obstacles prevent faithful, well-read people from
seeing what is written? There are two. The first and easier
obstacle is the requirement that you patiently study the
Bible, history, and theology and think through things
logically and analytically. Easy does not mean quick, as that
takes years. Easy means that the difficulties are patience
and moderate intelligence. This obstacle is of the head, not
the heart.</p>

<p>The second, greater obstacle is an emotional and
spiritual barrier. Only an opposing emotional force of
greater strength can breach that barrier. The unjust
suffering, despair, pain, and immense loss inflicted upon
Job trigger a recoil inside us all. No matter how my trials
vary from yours, we each share something in common with
Job. That shared grief throws up walls in our hearts. We do
not wish to revisit our pain.</p>

<p>I endured many years of hardship as foretold in a dream.
When it had run its course after my mother died, I enjoyed
great peace. It was from that peace, the fruit of a promise
made and kept by God that I would endure, combined with
empathy born from suffering like unto Job’s that the
emotional force was forged.</p>

<p>This resembled my experience with Philippians. Not until
I visited Janet Sullivan and experienced the joy of serving
someone in desperate need did I receive the power. That
power overcame the resistance inside my soul to
understanding Paul’s letter about the joy of sacrificial
service. Thinking back over other breakthroughs I have had
in understanding scripture, in each case there was an
emotional obstacle to overcome, a core of unbelief to be
overturned. The good news is that none need face that
battle alone. The Holy Spirit softens our hearts so that the
Word of God may be comprehended and cause us to grow.</p>

<p>Once both obstacles are overcome, with heart and mind
cooperating, it is possible to forge ahead.</p>

<h2>Prophetic Structures in Ecclesiastes</h2>

<p>Compare Job to Ecclesiastes. Job’s prophecies are not
arranged as tightly as those in Ecclesiastes. Solomon was
precise and deliberate, like a clockmaker.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first chapter introduces four cyclical structures for prophecy: by generations, by kingdoms, by precise units of time, and spiritual clocks counting things in sevens.</li>
<li>The third chapter describes the human process of growing to maturity and the course of Jesus’ life as a clock of sevens (seven quartets of times) but it doubles as an index into the whole book.</li>
<li>The whole book, divided by the phrase “under the sun” is a precise celestial clock.</li>
<li>The poem in chapter twelve, while a beautiful analogy to the human aging process and nice complement to chapter three, doubles as a prophetic framework of another sort. It chronicles the complete unraveling of civilization in the last days and is explored in “A Grand Father Clock &amp; a Silver Cord”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Solomon’s arrangement of prophetic material is
so tight, every time I saw a hint of a new pattern, if I was
right, a whole new set of prophecies would tumble out in a
matter of hours or days, like unlocking an overstuffed
closet. Not so with Job.</p>

<h2>Prophetic Structures in Job</h2>

<p>The prophecies in Job are partly structured and partly
loose. The ones I identified in <em>Job Rises</em> were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A “job description” for a savior</strong>. The book has nine prophecies that form Job’s expectations of who a savior must be and what he must do. All nine expectations are met in Jesus. They are distilled from Job’s nine speeches, but not every speech has one. (When I wrote <em>Job Rises</em>, I only knew of eight.)</li>
<li><strong>A prophetic outburst</strong>. Job 12 contains at least sixteen prophecies, out of chronological order. </li>
<li><strong>An altered creation story</strong>. In “Day of Rest: Job 3”, we discussed how Job rearranged the seven days of creation to tell another story. That makes it a spiritual clock.</li>
<li><strong>Leviathan</strong>. The chapter on Leviathan, Job 41, prophesies details of the crucifixion of Jesus. This is the original “empire clock”, but unlike Daniel’s four beasts and Revelation’s seven or eight, Job only has two beast empires. (The first is Behemoth, in Job 40, corresponding to Revelation’s beast from the land). However, Leviathan’s empire is ambiguous. By foretelling the crucifixion in chapter 41, one would associate Leviathan with Rome. However Revelation associates Leviathan (calling it the beast from the sea) with the anti-Christ’s final empire.</li>
<li><strong>A disordered clock</strong>. Years prior to writing that previous book, I attempted to discern a forty-two part pattern in all of human history and tie it to the Bible. Later, I decided to gather all the prophecies in Job (plus references to Biblical events that happened before Job lived) and slot them by year into the forty-two epochs. Would it reveal a pattern? It revealed the unexpected. From Genesis to Jesus, Job recalled or prophesied at least one event in every epoch. Critical epochs like the Babylonian exile and ministry of Jesus had many. A few prophesies fell in epochs after Jesus, especially the end times.</li>
</ul>

<p>How did I interpret this? Job is like the back cover blurb
for a book, listing key events to tease the reader into buying
it and reading the whole thing. Job tells you a little of what
will happen in every part of the Bible. Then, when I began
studying Ecclesiastes, chapter one lent support to the idea
that some books of the Bible give extensive chronological
prophecies. I dared to look at Job again and found two:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>Harvest clock</em> keyed off the change in speakers.</li>
<li>A <em>Generational clock</em> covering all forty-two generations from Adam to the Apocalypse.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Speaker changes</strong>. Job is a dialogue with five sections
which conform to the harvest pattern. It has seven main
speakers plus a narrator. There are twenty speaker
changes. The nineteen sections of dialogue plus two of
narration total twenty-one sections. Each section
corresponds to a period in history. Each speaker change
represents a dramatic historical change.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters</strong>. The Generational clock covers all forty-two
generations from Adam to the Apocalypse. Each of Job’s
forty-two chapters matches one generation of history.</p>

<p>Even though Job prized every word that proceeded from
the mouth of God, he had no idea the riches he had been
given! God arranged that out of his suffering, Job would
speak words that would become part of the Word of God.
Job saw no purpose to his suffering, but from it God
outlined His plan for all of human history.</p>

<p>Why does this discovery thrill me? When I was a new
believer, I was taught that God reveals His truth
progressively. To each dispensation, the Almighty delivers
new truths. Each generation is only accountable for what
they have received. This never seemed fair to me, but God
is God. Who am I to challenge His ways?</p>

<p>Now I see differently. In each generation, God <em>explains</em>
His truths more fully and more clearly. However, he
<em>delivered</em> all His truths long ago. Job was the first book of
the Bible written down. In it are hidden not just a pattern
for history, but a chronology of the life of the savior and the
fact that he would be both God and the “son of man”.
Every permissible means of communicating with God is
listed in its pages. (See the article <a href="./talk-to-god.html">Job and the Ways to Talk to God</a> for that analysis.)
A comprehensive ethical standard is
exemplified in the life of Job. And most importantly, a
righteousness that is by faith is preached which leads to
forgiveness and eternal life.</p>

<p>That is what God gave us in the Book of Job. Now to prove
it. The rest of this chapter summarizes my findings from
<em>Job Rises</em> on the “job description for a savior”. The three
chapters that follow will address the harvest and
generational clocks, respectively. They show different
dimensions to God’s plan than He revealed in Ecclesiastes.
Solomon, a wealthy king who never found peace,
prophesied God’s plan to raise His church up to full
maturity and infuse it with peace in the middle of a world
at war. In Job, we have the opposite. A suffering, destitute
man whose days ended in abundant peace, prophesied the
judgment and suffering that will engulf an unbelieving
world. But before that, he cried out for a savior.</p>

<h2>Job Description for a Savior</h2>

<p>Had I approached my study of Job asking, “How many
never-before-seen prophecies can I find to amaze people
and help me get unique information about the future?”,
would I have discovered much? Perhaps, but it would have
been the wrong things. Pride, vanity and a morbid curiosity
about the end of the world are suitable for writers of post
apocalyptic zombie movies, not Christians.</p>

<p>Instead, I asked the question, “In the midst of his despair,
what hopeful statements did Job make that showed his faith
lifting him up?” I really wanted to know what made Job rise.
Asking that one, simple, correct question unlocked
everything. I found Job’s hopeful words, then tried to
understand what they meant.</p>

<p>This led to a second, equally important question. At the
end, God first rebukes Job and then praises him, saying to
Job’s persecutors, 
<em>“You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.”</em> 
(Job 42:8) So which of Job’s words
were blameworthy and which praiseworthy? God wasn’t
specific enough for this “bear of little brain” to understand.
Months of patient analysis yielded the answer.</p>

<p>When Job tried to argue why his own righteousness was
so great that he did not deserve all that suffering and the
pain was accomplishing no good, <em>then he was wrong</em>.</p>

<p>When Job both described the qualities and capabilities he
needed in a savior and shouted his faith that God would
send that savior to him, <em>then he was right</em>.</p>

<p>Job <em>did not</em> speak the truth about himself, but he <em>did</em>
speak the truth about <strong>God</strong>. Once I got that straight, I knew
that Job’s every hopeful statement fell into the “right”
bucket, not the “wrong” bucket. Once I had those, I asked
myself whether they were just things that Job blurted out,
or if they described an ordered process. That was how I
noticed that almost every hopeful statement described
what Job craved in a savior. Job had set up a job interview.
Were there any qualified candidates?</p>

<p>How was Job brought to that point? What gave him such
clarity? A man with a broken arm needs someone to set it.
An unemployed person needs a job. A lonely person needs
a friend. Job needed everything! That is how he came up
with such a comprehensive list. Job’s righteousness,
intelligence and desperate poverty combined into a
clearheaded assessment of what had to be done to save
him, and what kind of savior would not terrify him, as God
was terrifying him. He needed a humble, consoling,
sympathetic friend, not a powerful tyrant. Yet that friend
needed all the power of God Almighty to finish the job.
Impossible!</p>

<p>He didn’t know the name, but Job knew he needed Jesus.
The table in a few pages pairs key passages from Job with
the quality or capability that Job knew he needed in a
savior, followed by the event in the life of Jesus that
demonstrated his fitness to meet that requirement.</p>

<p>The first quality in the table is the last I discovered, after
my previous book was already published. Job loved God’s
word with such loyalty and passion that he was willing to
die for it:</p>

<h4>“Oh, that I might have my request,</h4>

<h4>that God would grant what I hope for,</h4>

<h4>that God would be willing to crush me,</h4>

<h4>to let loose his hand and cut off my life!</h4>

<h4>Then I would still have this consolation—</h4>

<h4>my joy in unrelenting pain—</h4>

<h4>that <strong>I had not denied the words of the Holy One</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Job 6:8-10, NIV</h6>

<p>There are people that willingly die for their principles,
for their cause, but not like Job. God’s words were to him
like a person, like a loyal friend. While Job’s mind did not
know this, his heart did: the Word of God is a person; he is
the second person of the Trinity, and he has existed from
all eternity.</p>

<p><em>Job Rises</em> explores in detail the meaning of each of the
remaining job requirements, so a summary should suffice.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The eternal Word of God...</p></li>
<li><p>... became a man, able to be a humble, gentle and sympathetic friend.</p></li>
<li><p>At his baptism, Jesus, anointed savior by the Holy Spirit...</p></li>
<li><p>... launched into a ministry of healing, meaning he could heal Job of his painful boils. And that healing signified that Jesus had the authority to forgive sins, which Job craved even more than healing.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus accepted the cup of suffering, agreeing to be the ransom for sinners like Job.</p></li>
<li><p>On the cross, Jesus died and descended into the grave to rescue the faithful who had long awaited liberation, because he knew the path out of Sheol.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus rose from the dead, proving he is the redeemer Job cried out for to raise him from the dead.</p></li>
<li><p>Just as Job cried out for God to execute vengeance against the wicked and deliver justice to the innocent, Jesus will come again, riding a white horse and bearing a terrible sword to punish God’s enemies and rescue His children.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, Job’s hope that God will refine him as pure gold will be realized. At the rapture of the church, as the Apostle Paul said, “we shall be changed”.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>To Job was entrusted an outline of the entire life of Jesus
Christ. These nine events in our Lord’s journey, from his
exalted preexistence in glory, to his humble incarnation
and ministry, to the glorification of his saints at the end of
time are not only present in Job, <em>they are listed in
chronological order</em>.</p>

<p>Finding this glorious, systematic account of the Life of
Jesus hidden in Job drove me to look for more. I did not
find it by looking for prophecy. I found it by looking for
resilience, by seeking to understand how Job survived such
crushing blows. I found it by trying to understand love.</p>

<h4>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom</h4>

<h4>all mysteries and all knowledge,</h4>

<h4>and if I have a faith that can move mountains,</h4>

<h4><strong>but do not have love</strong>, I am nothing.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Corinthians 13:2, NIV</h6>

<p>As a new believer, I was fascinated by Biblical prophecy. I
tried to “fathom all mysteries” by untangling Revelation to
decide if the European Union was the evil empire of the
antichrist. That pursuit inflamed my pride and imagination.
When I spoke earlier about emotional barriers making it
impossible to understand Job or Ecclesiastes, I mean
nightmares for months on end. I mean terror and finding it
difficult to plan for a future that may never come.
(See the article <a href="./dreams.html">Dreams</a> for an account of my spiritual battle against false apocalyptic nightmares.)</p>

<p>Now when I read Job, do I see an aloof and capricious
God who inflicts suffering for no reason? No, I see the
overflowing love of God. When I read Ecclesiastes, do I view
life as pointlessly moving mountains to unearth meaning
that isn’t there? No, I see a God moving heaven and earth to
raise me up like His child through every stage of life to full
maturity. I see a God with an amazing plan for my joy,
happiness and fulfillment. I see prophecies as promises of
grace, not a schoolboy’s litany of dates and places of wars
to be memorized.</p>

<p>One more thing: even the bad guys in Job serve a noble
purpose. Just as heresies provoked the church to embrace a
more complete truth, the false comforters, Job’s friends,
sharpened one powerful point that should not be
overlooked. The last friend to speak was Bildad. His final
speech was brief, powerful – and wrong.</p>

<h4>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</h4>

<h5>“Dominion and fear are with God;</h5>

<h6>he makes <strong>peace</strong> in his high heaven.</h6>

<h5>Is there any number to his armies?</h5>

<h6>Upon whom does <strong>his light</strong> not arise?</h6>

<h5>How then can man be in the right before God?</h5>

<h6><strong>How can he who is born of woman be pure?</strong></h6>

<h5>Behold, even the moon is not bright,</h5>

<h6>and <strong>the stars</strong> are not pure in his eyes;</h6>

<h5>how much less man, who is a maggot,</h5>

<h6>and <strong>the son of man</strong>, who is a worm!”</h6>

<h6>- Job 25:1-6, ESV</h6>

<p>Bildad’s speech is as masterful an example of negative
philosophy as you will find. Everything that Bildad says
man cannot be and cannot do became possible in Christ. It
is fitting to ponder it, because it makes a false claim about
how God will bring peace: through armies alone. Critically,
Bildad ridicules Job for placing his trust in a “son of man”.
Job’s words:</p>

<h4>Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,</h4>

<h5>and he who testifies for me is on high.</h5>

<h4>My friends scorn me;</h4>

<h5>my eye pours out tears to God,</h5>

<h4>that he would argue the case of a man with God,</h4>

<h5>as <strong>a son of man</strong> does with his neighbor.</h5>

<h6>- Job 16:19-21, ESV</h6>

<p>Job believed that his witness was both “a son of man”
and in heaven. What do we learn about that “son of man”
by inverting Bildad’s words?</p>

<ul>
<li>The son of man is a peacemaker.</li>
<li>The son of man commands the armies of God.</li>
<li>The son of man is the light of the world.</li>
<li>The son of man is right before God.</li>
<li>The son of man would be born of woman, yet be pure, free from inherited sin.</li>
<li>The son of man, like the phases of the moon (as seen in Ecclesiastes), will grow brighter with each passing day, from new moon to full.</li>
<li>The son of man is the bright morning star and the sun of righteousness.</li>
<li>The son of man would die, but no maggot or worm feast on him, because death can not consume the resurrection and the life.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I began my study of Job, I wanted nothing to do
with the words of the three friends! After all, they were
wrong and he was right. The Lord convicted me that unless
I studied the <em>whole</em> message of Job, I would fail to
understand many wonderful things. The Lord was right.
Without meditating on the friends, how can we understand
the periods of history ruled by their words?</p>
