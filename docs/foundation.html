<p>The whole of my book <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em> is concerned with exploring the place of the Ten Commandments 
in the structures of God's wisdom. Parts of that analysis may be found in the Spiritual Growth section of this website:</p>

<p>This article will speak about the commandments more broadly. It will point out that every discussion of God's
plans for us must begin with those commandments.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>The Law is Important</h2>

<p>The Law is the foundation of Lady Wisdom's house. In the Bible, that law is symbolized
by a precious stone. Depending on your translation, that stone is either lapis lazuli or sapphire.
When Isaiah promised to Jerusalem that God would rebuild her on a foundation of lapis lazuli,
he meant that he would rebuild her by restoring in her the sacred place of the Law, the only true
foundation of a just and secure civilization. Tradition holds that the original stone tablets that Moses
carried down from Mount Sinai were carved by the finger of God upon lapis lazuli. A more certain reference
may be found in Exodus 24, which describes an event that occurred just before Moses ascended Sinai to get the tablets:</p>

<h4>Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel</h4>

<h4>went up and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like</h4>

<h4>a pavement made of <strong>lapis lazuli</strong>, as bright blue as the sky.</h4>

<h6>- Moses 24:9-10 (NIV)</h6>

<p>If something is solid enough for the God of the universe to walk on, it is solid enough to be a foundation for us.</p>

<p>In Ezekiel 1:26 and 10:1, the prophet beheld a vision of God's throne and said that it looked like lapis lazuli.
If a material is majestic enough to be used to construct God's throne, it is majestic enough for us to sit on.</p>

<p>The Ten Commandments (and the rest of the Law that came with it) are that foundation and that throne.
Here are a few ways in which the Ten Commandments are woven into Scripture that speak to its magnificence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hannah, mother of the Prophet Samuel, shaped her ten-verse prophetic prayer according to the commandments, as explored in <a href="./hannah-s-song.html">Hannah's Song</a></li>
<li>The Apostle Paul, when writing to Timothy, prophetically structured the ten chapters of those two letters according to the commandments, as shown in  <a href="./reconciliation.html">Reconciliation</a></li>
<li>Other Prophetic clocks structured according to the Ten Commandments are identified in <a href="./commandment-clocks.html">Commandment Clocks</a></li>
<li>The Gospel of Matthew is structured according to the Ten Commandments when broken into fourteen imperative statements: <a href="./matthew-and-the-law-of-christ.html&quot;">Matthew and the Law of Christ</a></li>
<li>Psalm 119, longest of the Psalms, extols the value of meditating on God's Law in almost every verse</li>
<li>Job has prophecies of how God judges empires across all of human history in an order governed by the Ten Commandments, as shown in <a href="./job-course-of-empires.html">Job: The Course of Empires</a> and <a href="./the-meaning-of-the-beasts-of-job.html">The Meaning of the Beasts of Job</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hannah's prayer is significant. She gives seven examples of people whose fortunes were reversed. 
Those seven reversals conform to both the Growth and Harvest Patterns. Wrapped around the seven reversals are 
additional verses that bring the total to ten and match the Ten Commandments. In two key places, there are references
to the number seven and the pillars of the earth, thus prophesying the existence of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
By these stylistic flourishes we are taught that the commandments are the basis of all short term spiritual harvests 
and long term spiritual growth and provide the matrix for all of God's wisdom.</p>

<p>Job's prophecies are also significant. They prove that God has been steadily judging major world empires over the course 
of thousands of years. Each act of judgment is for the violation of one of the commandments and the judgments are proceeding in order.
Nine of those judgments have been completed, meaning only one remains before Christ returns. The judged and fallen empires are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Babel - for worshiping human progress, not God</li>
<li>Egypt - for idolatry</li>
<li>Israel - for taking the Lord's name in vain</li>
<li>Assyria - for violating the sabbath</li>
<li>Babylon - for failure to honor parents</li>
<li>Persia - for murder (thirteen Assyrian kings murdered, one executed, many royal family members assassinated and Haman's genocide of the Jews initially condoned)</li>
<li>Greece - for adultery</li>
<li>Rome - for theft (including European colonialism)</li>
<li>Islam - for bearing false witness (denying God has a Son)</li>
</ul>

<p>The history and prophecy related to God's judgment of empires is meant to do more that intrigue and entertain, 
it is intended to show that God takes His commandments seriously. He pours His power into upholding them. He shapes the history
of civilizations by them and also the course of human lives, through the Growth and Harvest Patterns that structure all our days.
We must look at the commandments seriously. They were given so that we might become free and remain free, not live as slaves.</p>

<h2>What lies beneath the Law?</h2>

<p>If the commandments are the foundation of Lady Wisdom's house, it seems foolish to ask what sits under them. 
What could possibly be under the bottom? The question makes better sense if we ask what comes not under but before the Law. 
Why was the Law established? What was God's purpose in giving it?</p>

<p>About two decades ago, I wrote some fantasy novels set in the afterlife in a city called the Courtlands, a sort of purgatory.
While world building for those novels, I realized that I needed to design a court system to process all the dead people and decide 
where to send them. Not being a lawyer, I cast about for where to begin. I still remember my thought process. 
I came up with a chain of questions that led me to my answer.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of the law? <br/>
<strong>A:</strong> To uphold a moral code.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the purpose of a moral code? <br/>
<strong>A:</strong> To defend what is valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is valuable? <br/>
<strong>A:</strong> The heavenly treasures that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 6.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> And what are those heavenly treasures?</p>

<p>I spent years searching my heart and the Scriptures to make up a list of those treasures. I wrote <em>The Endless Hunt</em> 
to share my findings. My methodology was to find places in the Bible where Jesus, a prophet or apostle used language to
strongly emphasize the importance of some quality, value or behavior. I whittled the results down to a list of ten, then found
two more to make a total of twelve. These spiritual values can be grouped into four larger themes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>identifying</strong> (<em>our being</em>: The Fear of the Lord, Eternal Life, The Glory of God)</li>
<li><strong>establishing</strong> (<em>our relationships</em>: authority, work &amp; rest, family)</li>
<li><strong>nurturing</strong> (<em>our expression</em>: love, courage &amp; protection, wisdom &amp; justice &amp; truth)</li>
<li><strong>flourishing</strong> (<em>our fulness</em>: happiness &amp; generosity, freedom, peace &amp; joy)</li>
</ul>

<p>All that effort was expended to look afar, find the treasures, bring them close and then try via induction to wrestle them into 
a framework so that I could grasp them. It is likely that I missed some treasures, so having broad categories is useful.
It helps me bridge the gap with some catchalls, the unknown things that establish and nurture us and enable us to flourish.
Once I had my list, I could design an abstract yet coherent legal system to defend them.
This effort was fruitful because it disclosed to me what the most important of the treasures is: the Glory of God.
That prompted me to undertake a three-year long fast in search of God's glory.</p>

<p>The astute will say that if I had only trusted the traditions of the church, like the Shorter Westminster Catechism, it would 
have saved me time and trouble:</p>

<ul>
<li>Q. What is the chief end of man?</li>
<li>A. Man’s chief end is to <strong>glorify God</strong>, and to enjoy him forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>My answer is that sometimes you have to do the work yourself. With the "Greatest Commandment", the "Golden Rule", "the most excellent way"
and myriad other superlative statements circulating the church, climbing to the top of that mountain was arduous. However, from the mountain top it 
is easy to see down. Having found these treasures scattered throughout the Bible it is possible now to see how all of them can be 
defended by one compact set of laws, the Ten Commandments. Had I started years ago by going in the other direction, from commandment to treasure trove,
I would have come up short. You need to understand the commandments very well before you can see all that they protect. That I could not do.
Now I am learning how. Here then are a few ideas about what treasures each commandment protects.</p>

<h2>I. A God of Freedom</h2>

<h2>II. The Fear of the Lord, Courage &amp; Spiritual Treasure</h2>

<h2>III. Authority &amp; Forgiveness</h2>

<h2>IV. Wisdom, Purpose, Significance, Joy &amp; Peace</h2>

<h2>V. Family</h2>

<h2>VI. Life &amp; Protection</h2>

<h2>VII. Loyalty</h2>

<h2>VIII. Generosity</h2>

<h2>IX. Truth &amp; Justice</h2>

<h2>X. Happiness &amp; Contentment</h2>

<h2>The Glory of God</h2>
