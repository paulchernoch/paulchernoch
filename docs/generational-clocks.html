<p>It was while lingering over the chronology in Matthew 1 about a decade ago that the idea popped into my head.
What if God measures time by generations of people, not days and years? From that sprang all the rest.</p>

<p>The five Generational Clocks that I have found are few in number, but they were the starting point. 
Without finding these clocks, I would never proceeded to the others, nor found so much more. 
This article will summarize such clocks.</p>

<p>God can measure time any way He pleases. The insight that led me to the idea of Generational Clocks was that 
people are more important than the sun, moon and stars. Humanity's most accurate clocks are based on the 
radioactive decay of atoms. Before that, we measured time by the reliable motions of the heavenly bodies. 
Because people count, God counts people.</p>

<p>In a Generational Clock, like human generations each tick can be a different span of time.
One generation overlaps the next, so some years may fall during the lives of two people on the clock.
A few of the generations may align with the lives of actual people, like Adam and Methuselah.
The rest are symbolic generations. There might not be an actual person whose life captures the theme
and span of years for that tick of the clock.</p>

<p>For each clock, the following will be given:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the clock</li>
<li>The chapters from my books that explain the clock in detail</li>
<li>Citations of the whole book or select chapters from the Bible that contain the prophecies</li>
<li>A table with the generation number, start and end years, Bible verse references and prophetic interpretation</li>
<li>Details about the most significant prophecies found in the clock</li>
</ul>

<div class="sections">

To quickly jump to each example:

  <ol>
    <li> <a href="#1">Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="#2">Job’s Chapter Clock</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="#3">The Shepherd’s Clock (Psalm 119)</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="#4">The Cosmic Chiasm</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="#5">The Acrostic Clock (Psalms 112 & 112)</a> </li>
  </ol>

</div>

<p>I scoured the Bible for prophetic clocks. Some sequences of Bible passages that had a few good matches to history I rejected.
Unless every Bible passage (whether chapter, stanza or verse) in the sequence had at least one prophecy that was
fulfilled in the corresponding era, unless every generation between the first and last covered by the clock was represented, I discarded the idea and moved on. If God really intended that book or chapter to be a prophetic clock, it would be perfect.
No eras would be overlooked.</p>

<h2>History of the Idea</h2>

<p>My starting point was the genealogy in Matthew 1 which runs from Abraham to Jesus. The logical next step would have been 
to discover <em>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</em>, because that clock also runs from Abraham to Jesus.
However, I was not expecting any Bible passages or whole books to contain chronologically ordered prophecies.
Thus the first structure that I discovered was <em>The Cosmic Chiasm</em>, which is a general comparison of the Bible to world history.
From that clock I saw that God had a sequence for which aspects of culture and civilization he would tackle next in His plan
to redeem humanity. That was the key insight that enabled me to understand what God is up to in the story of the seven seals on the 
scroll in Revelation. With each seal that is broken, more than judgment occurs. God is building up a more just world.</p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes I discovered that there were several types of clock. The main one was Solomon's master Celestial clock based on the
twenty-eight times. In a chapter titled "Let's Synchronize our Watches", I resolved the question of how long each generation should be.
<em>Solomon's Celestial Clock</em> clearly required 120 years per period, but that didn't line up with <em>The Cosmic Chiasm</em>, which seemed to
require a period of 119 years. Two things helped me realize that the clocks needed to have separate but almost equal periods.
First was the story of Noah's Ark. Prior to the flood, God said that He would set a limit of 120 years for human life. That gives us
the 120-year period length. However, the flood ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, and <strong>7 x 17 = 119</strong>. In a subtle
way the same story gives us the number 119. Since Psalm 119 is one of my favorites and inspired major features of my novels, 
I turned to that Psalm to see if it had anything prophetic hidden in it. That was how I found <em>The Shepherd’s Clock</em>. 
Each stanza of the poem corresponds to one generation of history, with the first matching the time of Adam, the second the time of Methuselah,
and the rest successive 119-year periods.</p>

<p>My thought to search Job for prophetic clocks hinged on four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had just written <em>Job Rises</em> and was familiar with the material.</li>
<li>During that writing, I discovered many prophecies in Job but did not see any order to them, chronological or otherwise.</li>
<li>A also discovered in Job eight prophecies (and after the book was finished, a ninth) that pointed to Jesus which were in chronological order.</li>
<li>After <em>Job Rises</em> was finished, I discovered the Harvest Pattern in Matthew and observed that the Book of Job followed that pattern precisely. So when I discovered the similar Growth Pattern in Ecclesiastes, it was natural to check if Job conformed to that pattern also.</li>
</ul>

<p>Between three of my books, I would end up finding seven prophetic clocks in Job. However, the fact that the sequence in Matthew's chronology was
from Abraham to Jesus by none of my clocks matched it left me with the feeling that I was missing something.</p>

<p>Another perplexity was about the periods. I found clocks with many different periods. However, there was one period that many other writers on prophecy 
make much of that I did not see: the fifty-year Jubilee.</p>

<p>I can't recall what the final trigger was that caused me to spot <em>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</em>. I do recall one observation that sealed the deal.
Matthew's chronology makes much of the number forty-two, by breaking history into three sets of fourteen names. By showing the number forty-two,
he hid the number fifty. The chronology has fifty names, whether of individuals or collections (like naming someone's brothers as a collection).
If you overlap generations of length fifty by one year, you get forty-nine years. Then if you divide the history from Abraham to a few years after Jesus' resurrection into forty-two segments, forty-nine years is the best fit for a period length.</p>

<p>Lastly, I discovered the <em>The Acrostic Clock</em>. I had found a pattern that encompassed half of the Psalms, but when I hit Psalm 112, the prophetic link
was weak. I noticed (as many have before) that Psalms 111 and 112 form a unit. They have the same length in verses and matching verses often use
the same phrases. The themes of the psalms linked up, as the end of Psalm 111 and beginning of Psalm 112 speak of the fear of the Lord.
However, the proper way to interpret these psalms is not by verse, but by poetic line. As the Hebrew scholars have long noted, each phrase begins
with a different Hebrew letter, ordered by the Hebrew alphabet. The psalms are acrostics. </p>

<p>Each psalm has an introductory "Praise the Lord!" followed by the twenty-two poetic lines. Since I had already found a clock in Psalm 119, another
acrostic psalm, it seemed sensible to search for another clock in Psalm 111 that ran from Creation to Christ. That would leave Psalm 112 to
continue the clock from Christ's First to his Second Coming. Since the two psalms had overlapping themes, it makes sense that they have overlapping
time ranges. The second half clock backs up to the generation before Christ, then proceeds forwards to the end of history.</p>

<p>What is the point of all this rambling? To find these clocks, I had to make numerous connections between Matthew, Genesis, Psalms, Job and Ecclesiastes.
If I did not have ready familiarity with these texts, this would never have happened. The Holy Spirit never said, "Go to Page 200 in your Bible" or some
such thing. If I ever was guided to make a connection, it was the Spirit amplifying memories that were already there. There is no substitute for
years of patient Bible study and reflection.</p>

<h2>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Job</li>
<li>Book defined in: <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em></li>
<li>Chapters in book that describe it:
<ul>
<li><strong>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock, Defined</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prophecies from Abraham to David: Job 1-20</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prophecies from Solomon to Christ: Job 21-42</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time span: 1952 BC-108 AD</li>
<li>Milestones: Abraham to the Apostolic Age</li>
<li>Intervals: 42 (one per chapter of Job)</li>
<li>Period: 49 (overlapping 50-year jubilees)</li>
</ul>

<p>The research that went into finding and defining this clock was fun.
It involved spotting and solving an ancient word puzzle.
See a record of that work here:</p>

<p><a href="./job-s-anti-jubilee-clock-defined.html">Job's Anti-Jubilee Clock, Defined</a></p>

<p>This is a summary of all the eras covered by this clock. Since every chapter of Job matches an era of history,
the Era number matches the chapter of Job that contains the Prophecy. The Bible References column will name
specific verses in Job that are relevant to the prophecy, as well as name passages elsewhere in the Bible that
also address this subject, sometimes with phrases that match thus establishing the link. 
Also note that each era starts one year before the end of the previous era, which overlap is a defining feature
of a Generational Clock.</p>

<p>After this summary table, a few of the prophecies will be spelled out in detail.</p>

<p>The main theme of this clock is that after long centuries of worsening conditions in Israel,
the hoped for year of Jubilee finally arrived. The law of the year of Jubilee called upon people to 
cancel debts, restore lost property and free slaves. The debt was sin, the property was a deed to a plot of land in the kingdom of heaven,
and the slaves were all who were in bondage to Satan. Jesus was that Jubilee.</p>

<p>Here are some representative prophecies from "Prophecies from Abraham to David: Job 1-20":</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Chapter: 6</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1707-1657 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Joseph &amp; his brothers</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Genesis 37, 39-47</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>This was an eventful time.</p>

<ul>
<li>1701 BC. Joseph born when Jacob was 91.</li>
<li>1695-1692 BC. Jacob wrestles with an angel.</li>
<li>1686 BC. Joseph, age 17, sold into slavery by his brothers.</li>
<li>1673 BC. Joseph, age 30, enters Pharaoh's service.</li>
<li>1673-1659 BC. Fourteen years plenty &amp; famine in Egypt.</li>
<li>1662 BC. Jacob enters Egypt at the age of 130.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parallels between Joseph’s story and Job 6 are obvious.</p>

<h4>15 <strong>But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams</strong>,</h4>

<h5>as the streams that overflow</h5>

<h4>16 when darkened by thawing ice</h4>

<h5>and swollen with melting snow,</h5>

<h4>17 <strong>but that stop flowing in the dry season</strong>,</h4>

<h5>and in the heat vanish from their channels.</h5>

<h4>18 Caravans turn aside from their routes;</h4>

<h5>they go off into the wasteland and perish.</h5>

<h4>19 The caravans of Tema look for water,</h4>

<h5>the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.</h5>

<h4>20 They are distressed, because they had been confident;</h4>

<h5>they arrive there, only to be disappointed.</h5>

<h4>…</h4>

<h4>22 Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf,</h4>

<h5><strong>pay a ransom for me from your wealth</strong>,</h5>

<h4>23 deliver me from the hand of the enemy,</h4>

<h5>rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?</h5>

<h4>…</h4>

<h4>27 <strong>You would even cast lots for the fatherless</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and barter away your friend</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 6:15-20,22-23,27</h6>

<p>Joseph’s ten brothers (excluding Benjamin) were worse than “undependable”, deciding to
“barter away” their younger brother for cash to satisfy their jealous pride. Joseph longed
for someone to “pay a ransom” for him, but Pharaoh’s cupbearer forgot for years to
reciprocate the blessing that Joseph’s dream brought him. That man deserves Job’s earlier
word:</p>

<h4>“He who withholds kindness from a friend</h4>

<h5>forsakes the fear of the Almighty.”</h5>

<h6>- Job 6:14</h6>

<p>Even the analogy of streams that <em>“stop flowing in the dry season”</em> matches the famine that
plagued the land.</p>

<p>Amid all these trials, Jacob persevered and maintained hope in the dreams that God
gave him as a boy. He retained his morals, as proved when he refused to commit adultery
with Potiphar’s wife and behaved as a model prisoner. Truly, God’s words were as precious
to him as they were to Job:</p>

<h4>This would be my comfort;</h4>

<h5>I would even exult in pain unsparing,</h5>

<h6>for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</h6>

<h6>- Job 6:10</h6>

<p>The previous eras dealt with the challenges of fatherhood, marriage, family relationships,
jealousy and mistreatment at work. Now we have outright betrayal. The turning point in
Joseph’s story is when he forgives his brothers. What of Job?</p>

<h4>Teach me, and I will be silent;</h4>

<h5>make me understand how I have gone astray.</h5>

<h6>- Job 6:24</h6>

<p>There is no hint of forgiveness in Job 6, only Job’s plea that God teach him where he has
gone wrong. That answer would await the final chapter, Job 42, when God commands Job’s
friends to offer sacrifices of repentance and Job to grant them forgiveness. We have Joseph.
We have Job. Will we wait until the end of our stories to forgive? Here is a prayer to
consider:</p>

<h4>This very day,</h4>

<h4>Lord, help me be</h4>

<h4>A friend or brother’s</h4>

<h4>Jubilee;</h4>

<h4>Forgiving,</h4>

<h4>Canceling,</h4>

<h4>Setting free,</h4>

<h4>The time and place</h4>

<h4>Are up to me.</h4>

<h3>Chapter: 11</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1462-1412 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>: Moses</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: The Pentateuch</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapters 9 and 10 of Job alluded to Moses, the helpless child, and Moses, the fugitive.
With chapter 11, we meet Moses, the prophet. In verse 2, Zophar’s taunt inverts a fantastic
blessing. “Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?”
No, the multitude of words should not go unanswered, but the proper answer is faith,
obedience and gratitude. While Job by God’s affirmation spoke correctly about God by his
multitude of words, what other man spoke a greater multitude of words of greater weight?
Who but Moses! At least forty human authors penned the Bible, but none wrote more of it
than Moses. Not only can Moses be “judged right”, it is by his words, the commandments
he delivered to us from God, that all mankind shall be judged.</p>

<p>Of what other man besides the Savior can we say this?</p>

<h4>For you say, <strong>‘My doctrine is pure</strong>,</h4>

<h5>and I am clean in God's eyes.’</h5>

<h4>But oh, that God would speak</h4>

<h5>and open his lips to you,</h5>

<h4>and that he would tell you the <strong>secrets of wisdom</strong>!</h4>

<h5>For he is manifold in understanding.</h5>

<h4>Know then that God exacts of you</h4>

<h5>less than your guilt deserves.</h5>

<h6>- Job 11:4-6</h6>

<p>Moses’ words constitute the very definition of what <em>“doctrine is pure”</em>. Not only did God
“speak and open his lips to” Moses, he did one better.
<em>“Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend…”</em> (Exodus 33:11a)</p>

<p>Now Zophar said one thing with which Job would agree in chapter 28. The path to
wisdom is so long, so high, and so deep that we cannot reach it by our own effort.</p>

<h4>Can you find out the deep things of God?</h4>

<h5>Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?</h5>

<h4><strong>It is higher than heaven—what can you do?</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>Deeper than Sheol—what can you know?</strong></h5>

<h4>Its measure is longer than the earth</h4>

<h5>and <strong>broader than the sea</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 11:7-9</h6>

<p>Yet what does Moses tell us? God has crossed that infinite gap to give His wisdom to us!</p>

<h4>For this commandment that I command you today</h4>

<h4>is not too hard for you, <strong>neither is it far off</strong>.</h4>

<h4>It is not <strong>in heaven</strong>, that you should say,</h4>

<h5>‘Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us,</h5>

<h5>that we may hear it and do it?’</h5>

<h4><strong>Neither is it beyond the sea</strong>, that you should say,</h4>

<h5>‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us,</h5>

<h5>that we may hear it and do it?’</h5>

<h4>But <strong>the word is very near you</strong>. It is in your mouth and</h4>

<h4>in your heart, so that you can do it.</h4>

<h4>See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.</h4>

<h6>- Deuteronomy 30:11-15</h6>

<p>Earlier in this book there was talk of summons, by Pharaoh, God or Moses. The
summons were a test of who had authority and who did not. This same question is posed
in Job:</p>

<h4>If he passes through and imprisons</h4>

<h5>and <strong>summons the court</strong>,</h5>

<h6><strong>who can turn him back</strong>?</h6>

<h6>- Job 11:10</h6>

<p>Pharaoh tried to keep the Hebrew people imprisoned. He failed. 
How did God <em>“turn him back”</em> when Pharaoh tried to stop them from leaving? 
He did it by working His wonders, two of which are echoed by Zophar’s words:</p>

<h4>You will forget your misery;</h4>

<h5>you will remember it as <strong>waters that have passed away</strong>.</h5>

<h4>And your life will be brighter than the noonday;</h4>

<h5>its <strong>darkness will be like the morning</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 11:16-17</h6>

<p>The latter reference is to the plague of darkness. The former refers to the parting of the
Red Sea (or less likely the plague of blood on the Nile). The final negative example
summarizes the outcome of all that God did through Moses:</p>

<h4>But the eyes of the wicked will fail;</h4>

<h5>all <strong>way of escape</strong> will be lost to them,</h5>

<h6>and their hope is to breathe their last.”</h6>

<h6>- Job 11:20, ESV</h6>

<p>The sons and daughters of Israel were given an undeserved <em>“way of escape”</em>. 
We don’t deserve ours either, but the offer still stands.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 13</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1364-1314 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Othniel, Judges in General</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Judges 3:7-11</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1358 BC, Joshua died and the era of the judges began. Othniel was the first judge and
served forty years, the majority of this generation. This chapter of Job focuses on one
theme: bringing a court case to God to be judged. The word “case” (as in court case)
appears seven times in Job (in the ESV). The first appearance and greatest number of
appearances fall in this chapter.</p>

<p>During the time of the Judges, God would allow Israel’s enemies to triumph over them
as punishment and discipline for their transgressions. Then he would send a judge to
rescue them. Compare this to Job’s powerful declaration of faith that the one who
chastises him will also rescue him:</p>

<h4>Though he slay me, I will hope in him;</h4>

<h5>yet I will argue my ways to his face.</h5>

<h4>This will be my salvation,</h4>

<h5>that the godless shall not come before him.</h5>

<h6>- Job 13:15-16</h6>

<p>Instead of quoting most of Job chapter 13, here is a word porridge of phrases it includes
related to the majesty of the prosecution of a court case:</p>

<h4>argument… pleadings… falsely… deceitfully…</h4>

<h4>show partiality… plead the case… searches… deceive… rebuke…</h4>

<h4>show partiality… majesty… defenses… silence… speak… argue…</h4>

<h4>salvation… declaration… prepared my case…</h4>

<h4>in the right… contend… grant… withdraw…</h4>

<h4>call… answer… speak… reply.</h4>

<h6>- Job 13:6-22</h6>

<p>Job even addresses the issue of the injustice of confessions obtained under duress:</p>

<h4>Only grant me two things,</h4>

<h5>then I will not hide myself from your face:</h5>

<h4>withdraw your hand far from me,</h4>

<h5>and let not dread of you terrify me.</h5>

<h6>- Job 13:20-21</h6>

<p>There is no question any longer. The chapters of Job are perfectly attuned to the spiritual
and political situation in Israel. If you feel like you are being judged harshly, turn to Job.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now here are some representative prophecies from "Prophecies from Solomon to Christ: Job 21-42":</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Chapter: 22</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 923-873 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>: Jeroboam</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: 1 Kings 12, 14</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>For his pride, God tore half the kingdom from Rehoboam, son of Solomon. He gave it
to Jeroboam, who ruled over the northern kingdom of Israel from 922-901 BC. However,
because Jeroboam desired power more than obedience to God, the Lord withdrew His
blessing. Thus in 913 BC, he lost the Battle of Mount Zemaraim. The core of his sin was
using religion as a means to maintain control over his people. As if making one golden
calf wasn’t bad enough, he made two!</p>

<h4>And Jeroboam said in his heart,</h4>

<h5>“Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David.</h5>

<h5>If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the</h5>

<h5>temple of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of</h5>

<h5>this people will turn again to their lord, to</h5>

<h5>Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me</h5>

<h5>and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”</h5>

<h4><strong>So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold</strong>.</h4>

<h4>And he said to the people,</h4>

<h5>“You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough.</h5>

<h5>Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you</h5>

<h5>up out of the land of Egypt.”</h5>

<h6>- 1 Kings 12:26-28</h6>

<p>The parallel verses in Job are spot on:</p>

<h4>If you return to the Almighty you will be built up;</h4>

<h5>if you remove injustice far from your tents,</h5>

<h4>if you lay <strong>gold</strong> in the dust,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>gold of Ophir</strong> among the stones of the torrent-bed,</h5>

<h4><strong>then the Almighty will be your gold</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and your precious silver</strong>.</h5>

<h4>For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty</h4>

<h5>and lift up your face to God.</h5>

<h4>You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you,</h4>

<h5>and you will pay your vows.</h5>

<h4>You will decide on a matter,</h4>

<h5>and it will be established for you,</h5>

<h6>and light will shine on your ways.</h6>

<h6>- Job 22:23-28</h6>

<p>Jeroboam did not listen. His god was an idol of gold. His line of kings was not
established and in his kingdom darkness reigned. In 1 Kings 14, the prophet Ahijah told
Jeroboam’s wife that their son would die, even though the boy was good unlike his father.
This is like what was written in Job:</p>

<h4>But you say, ‘What does God know?</h4>

<h5>Can he judge through the deep darkness?</h5>

<h4>Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>he walks on the vault of heaven</strong>.’</h5>

<h4>Will you keep to the old way</h4>

<h5>that wicked men have trod?</h5>

<h4><strong>They were snatched away before their time</strong>;</h4>

<h5><strong>their foundation was washed away</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 22:13-16</h6>

<p>Thus the king’s son was snatched away before his time, as judgement from God. These
words would find an opposite fulfillment in the next generation. In those days Elijah
would pierce the clouds and walk on the vaults of heaven, snatched away not for
judgement, but as a reward for faithfulness, on chariots of fire.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 24</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 825-775 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: A slave girl, Naaman, Elisha</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: 2 Kings 5</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter of Job is about injustice against the poor. There was no lack of that during
this generation. What is surprising is the grace that a powerful man received courtesy of
his wife’s slave.</p>

<h4>There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast,</h4>

<h4>and they take a pledge against the poor…</h4>

<h4>Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power;</h4>

<h5>they rise up when they despair of life.</h5>

<h4>He gives them security, and they are supported,</h4>

<h5>and his eyes are upon their ways.</h5>

<h6>- Job 24:9,22-23</h6>

<p>In this story, the fatherless child is a Jewish slave girl carried off to Syria by invading
soldiers. The mighty who despaired of life was the enemy general, Naaman. The slave girl
had mercy on her master, giving him advice about whom he could visit who would cure
him of his leprosy.</p>

<h4>Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria,</h4>

<h4>was a great man with his master and in high favor,</h4>

<h4>because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria.</h4>

<h4>He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</h4>

<h4>Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off</h4>

<h4>a little girl from the land of Israel, and she worked</h4>

<h4>in the service of Naaman's wife. She said to her mistress,</h4>

<h5>“Would that my lord were with the prophet who is</h5>

<h5>in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”</h5>

<h6>- 2 Kings 5:1-3</h6>

<p>Thanks to the girl, whose name we never learn, Naaman journeys to see the prophet
Elisha and is healed. This is a powerful example of the power of loving your enemy, which
Jesus would one day repeat on a cosmic scale.</p>

<p>Jumping back to Job’s complaint in 24:22-23, I am humbled. Job was confused by God’s
behavior. God seemed to be blessing these mighty but wicked people. When I read these
words years ago, I assumed that Job was missing the big picture. Those wicked people
would eventually get the justice they deserved. It was a matter of seeing God’s eternal plan.
The blessings they received sprang from God patiently deferring his judgement upon them;
their wealth was merely the fruit of their own wickedness left unpunished. Their increase
derived from God being passive, not active. Thanks to the comparison with the story of
Naaman, the full force of Job’s words hit me. God actively arranged for Naaman to be
healed. God does as He teaches: He loves His enemies. Anyone who is not staggered by
this reality like Job was is a fool. It is a glorious but terrifying reality.</p>

<p>This story deserves comparison to the clock’s theme of an anti-jubilee. The jubilee sets
slaves free. Naaman’s compassionate slave girl was not set free. The jubilee restores
property and cancels debts. Assyria, which had captured land and treasure from Israel,
offered to pay Elisha for healing, but he refused payment. The Jubilee year begins with
celebrating the Day of Atonement, a Jewish ritual. In the end, Naaman pleads for Elisha to
pray for God to have mercy on him when he is required to stand beside his king at
Assyria’s pagan temple. This is as anti-jubilee as it gets. God’s ways are beyond our
understanding.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 30</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 531-481 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subject</strong>: Jerusalem</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Exilic Psalms, Nehemiah 1</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time of this generation, the Babylonian Exile was over, but Jerusalem and Judah
remained in deep distress. Nehemiah would not return to rebuild until the next era, but
the introduction to his book describes the state of affairs at this time.</p>

<h4>And they said to me,</h4>

<h5>“The remnant there in the province who had survived</h5>

<h5>the exile is in great trouble and shame.</h5>

<h5>The wall of Jerusalem is broken down,</h5>

<h5>and its gates are destroyed by fire.”</h5>

<h5>- Nehemiah 1:3</h5>

<p>The breaches in Jerusalem’s walls mirror Job’s analogy for the lack of protection plaguing
him:</p>

<h4>On my right hand the rabble rise;</h4>

<h5>they push away my feet;</h5>

<h5>they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</h5>

<h4>They break up my path;</h4>

<h5>they promote my calamity;</h5>

<h5>they need no one to help them.</h5>

<h4><strong>As through a wide breach they come</strong>;</h4>

<h5>amid the crash they roll on.</h5>

<h4>Terrors are turned upon me;</h4>

<h5>my honor is pursued as by the wind,</h5>

<h5>and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.</h5>

<h6>- Job 30:12-15</h6>

<p>Job in this chapter also makes a musical analogy:</p>

<h4>My <strong>lyre</strong> is turned to mourning,</h4>

<h5>and my pipe to the voice of those who <strong>weep</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 30:31</h6>

<p>By this time, most of the Old Testament had been written. The time of silence between
the Testaments would soon begin, when the tongues of the prophets would be stilled. The
most powerful words of Scripture written in these years were the Exilic Psalms. Among
them, Psalm 137 stands out:</p>

<h4>By the waters of Babylon,</h4>

<h5>there we sat down and <strong>wept</strong>,</h5>

<h5>when we remembered Zion.</h5>

<h4>On the willows there</h4>

<h5><strong>we hung up our lyres</strong>.</h5>

<h4>For there our captors</h4>

<h5>required of us songs,</h5>

<h4>and our tormentors, mirth, saying,</h4>

<h5>“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”</h5>

<h4>How shall we sing the Lord's song</h4>

<h5>in a foreign land?</h5>

<h4>If I forget you, O Jerusalem,</h4>

<h5>let my right hand forget its skill!</h5>

<h4>Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,</h4>

<h5>if I do not remember you,</h5>

<h4>if I do not set Jerusalem</h4>

<h5>above my highest joy!</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 137:1-6</h6>

<p>Exiled Jews mourned Jerusalem after it was destroyed. This prophecy in Job shows God’s
deep compassion. The Lord began to mourn and sympathize prophetically with the people
of Jerusalem a millennium earlier. His love endures forever. Though you enter a time of
suffering today, the Lord’s compassion for you began before you were born.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 35</h3>

<h5>and behold the clouds, which are higher than you...</h5>

<h4>Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out;</h4>

<h5>they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.</h5>

<h4>But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker,</h4>

<h5>who gives songs in the night,</h5>

<h4><strong>who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?</strong>’</h5>

<h6>- Job 35:5,10-11</h6>

<p>As a new Christian, this passage of Job spoke to me more than any other, because I was
once an oppressed person who literally sang songs in the night, seeking relief from despair.
I sang those songs in college, in a place where people study the science of the heavens.</p>

<p>The start of this generation included the final decade of the life of Euclid, the famed
Greek mathematician and teacher. A more fitting example of one prone to 
<em>“look at the heavens”</em> was Eratosthenes, chief librarian of Alexandria. He lived from 276-194 BC.
Among his discoveries were a means to measure the circumference of the Earth and its
axial tilt. He created the first global projection of the world. His library was the center of
learning in the ancient world. In those days, God began to divulge to mankind the secrets
of the heavens.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 39</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 90-40 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Rome, Jerusalem</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Isaiah 11:6, Habakkuk 1:8, Zephaniah 3:3, Ezekiel 22:25-27, Psalm 80:12:13</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>The pivotal time for each beastly kingdom in Daniel’s prophecies is when it captures
Jerusalem. This era saw Jerusalem change hands once again, when the Roman general
Pompey besieged the city in 63 BC. The fourth beast in Daniel is called variously terrible
and the legs of iron on a magnificent statue. In other Old Testament prophecies Rome is
also symbolized by wolves, which fits Rome’s own origin myth of its founders, Romulus
and Remus, being suckled by wolves.</p>

<p>The Roman legions marched behind a soldier (called an aquiline) bearing a special
emblem, called a signa militaria. Over the years, the emblem design underwent changes.
The most ancient standard employed by them is said to have been a handful (manipulus)
of straw fixed to the top of a spear or pole. After that, they shifted to various animals,
before Gaius Marius standardized upon the eagle in 104 BC. This means that the eagle
became the primary symbol of Rome less than a score of years before this era began.
According to Pliny the Elder, the full list of animals used as insignia is:</p>

<ul>
<li>eagle (the Aquila)</li>
<li>wolf</li>
<li>ox with a man's head</li>
<li>horse</li>
<li>boar</li>
</ul>

<p>This would be a curiosity if not for the parables found in Job 39 and elsewhere.
Rome is symbolized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>wolf</strong> in Isaiah, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and Ezekiel. </li>
<li>The <strong>wild ox</strong> is described in Job 39:9-12. </li>
<li>The <strong>horse</strong> is described in Job 39:19-24.</li>
<li>The <strong>boar</strong> only shows up once in the ESV (in Psalm 80), but it looks like it might also describe Rome.</li>
<li>The <strong>eagle</strong> appears in Job 39:27-30.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only a small number of empires ever broke down the walls of Jerusalem, Rome did it
multiple times and its devastation was the worst:</p>

<h4>Why then have you broken down its walls,</h4>

<h5>so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?</h5>

<h4>The <strong>boar</strong> from the forest ravages it,</h4>

<h5>and all that move in the field feed on it.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 80:12-13</h6>

<p>Finally, the last parable in Job 39 is about the <strong>eagle</strong>:</p>

<h4>Is it at your command that the <strong>eagle</strong> mounts up</h4>

<h5>and <strong>makes his nest on high</strong>?</h5>

<h4>On the rock he dwells and makes his home,</h4>

<h5>on the rocky crag and stronghold.</h5>

<h4>From there he spies out the prey;</h4>

<h5>his eyes behold it from far away.</h5>

<h4>His young ones suck up blood,</h4>

<h5>and where the slain are, there is he.</h5>

<h6>- Job 39:27-30</h6>

<p>The eagle nesting on high is Rome occupying Jerusalem. With three of Rome’s five
military logos showing up in one chapter of Job and the other two matching imagery in
other Bible prophecies, it looks like the Bible nailed it. These prophecies were given from
centuries to over a millennia before Rome even existed. God’s foreknowledge is
unassailable.</p>

<p>Of course, the other clock from <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, matching as its 39th era the years 1923-2042 AD,
prophesied an even more astounding eagle-related event. Which eagle made its nest higher
than any other nest in the history of eagle’s nests? That would be the eagle whose
occupants in 1969 said:</p>

<p><em>*“The eagle has landed.” *</em></p>

<p>That eagle is the symbol of the new Rome.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 40</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 41 BC - 10 AD (No year zero!)</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Rome, Egypt</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Daniel 2</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>In 44 BC, on my birthday, the Ides of March, Julius Caesar was assassinated. Augustus
Caesar, greatest of Rome’s emperors, succeeded him. This triggered over a decade of civil
wars, ending in 32 BC with the Battle of Actium, whose loss prompted Antony and
Cleopatra to commit suicide. This completed the transformation of the Roman Republic
into the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The creation of the Roman Empire is memorialized in Job 40 and likened to a
monstrous beast named Behemoth:</p>

<h4>Behold, Behemoth,</h4>

<h5>which I made as I made you;</h5>

<h5>he eats grass like an <strong>ox</strong>.</h5>

<h4>Behold, his strength in his loins,</h4>

<h5>and his power in the muscles of his belly.</h5>

<h4>He makes his tail stiff like a cedar;</h4>

<h5>the sinews of his thighs are knit together.</h5>

<h4><strong>His bones are tubes of bronze</strong>,</h4>

<h5><strong>his limbs like bars of iron</strong>.</h5>

<h4>He is the <strong>first of the works of God</strong>;</h4>

<h5>let him who made him bring near <strong>his sword</strong>!</h5>

<h4><strong>For the mountains yield food for him</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>where all the wild beasts play</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 40:15-20</h6>

<p>As noted in the previous section, the ox is one of the five animals used by Rome to
represent their legions. Bronze is associated with Daniel’s third empire, Greece. Rome had
bones of bronze because it adopted much from the Greeks: philosophy, mathematics and
Greek as the trade language of the empire. Daniel’s fourth empire, generally accepted to be
Rome, had legs of iron, matching that analogy. Finally, the place “where all the wild beasts
play” is Egypt. It had previously been conquered by the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and
now in this era, the Romans. It would later be conquered by Islam. Egypt would become
the breadbasket of the Roman Empire and <strong>“yield food for him”</strong>.</p>

<p>In prophecy, Behemoth shall have two incarnations. The first was Rome and the second
shall be the beast from the sea of Revelation 13. One feature they share in common is a
strong commitment to law and order, ruthlessly applied. Behemoth is therefore lawful evil,
while Leviathan is chaotic evil. The laws of Behemoth may permit much evil and prohibit
much good, but the stability it provides is not entirely devoid of benefits. The Pax Romana
permitted a great expansion in world trade, preserved and advanced Greek philosophy,
mathematics and science, and enriched its upper classes immensely.</p>

<p>Yes, Rome counts as <em>“first of the works of God”</em>. No empire comes close to lasting as long as
it did, or having as great an influence upon the entire world. However, this verse applies to
another of God’s works who was begotten in this era, the Incarnate Son of God, Jesus
Christ. These two, Rome and Jesus, belong together. In Job, God said, 
<em>“Let him who made him bring near his sword!”</em> Centuries later Jesus said, 
<em>“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”</em> (Matthew 10:34) 
When the Roman emperor named Christianity the state religion in 380 AD via the Edict of Thessalonica,
Rome became Christ’s sword, wielded by his church to spread the gospel.</p>

<h3>Chapter: 41</h3>

<p>Of all the prophecies in this generational clock, the most detailed and profound is contained in Job chapter 41.
It prophesies the suffering and crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and the establishment of a new covenant.
It does this through negative philosophy, telling us all the good things that an evil sea serpent WILL NOT do for us.
Those are the very things that are Lord DID do for us.
This prophecy is described in the following article on this website:</p>

<p><a href="./the-journey-pattern.html">The Journey Pattern</a></p>

<p>That is all for Job's Anti-Jubilee Clock. It ended with the greatest Jubilee, the coming of Christ who forgives all out debts.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to think that I cherry-picked the best prophecies to show here
and that the ones I did not show are vague and weakly supported. No, I selected the prophecies from these chapters because 
they were the shortest!</p>

</ul>

<h3>On Subjectivity</h3>

<p>The scale of the prophetic content in Job grew on me slowly over a period of years. After finding Job's "Job description for a savior",
which named nine aspects of Jesus' ministry in chronological order, I entertained the possibility that there were more such clocks.
This clock I found before the previous one (Job's Anti-Jubilee Clock). After the idea occurred to me, I set out to prove it.
That meant trying to find at least one prophecy in each chapter of Job. That required a lot of digging. The clock runs from the Creation
to Christ's second coming - all of human history!</p>

<p>A common criticism of attempts to match Bible statements to history is how subjective such correspondences are.
On the surface, many verses can be matched to multiple events throughout history. The same criticism can be leveled against my matches,
but with a difference. By dividing Job into forty-two parts and matching each to an era of history, I reduce the number of
years that could contain an event that matches a passage from over six thousand years to just 119 years. This focusing effect
diminishes the likelihood of a false match.</p>

<p>A second lens that focuses our attention is the Bible. For eras that preceded the Babylonian exile, the matching event must be
one recorded in the Bible or alluded to by it. Some eras of history are scarcely mentioned in the Bible. A few verses or a chapter in 
one book may be all that the Bible has to say about that era. For one of Job's prophecies to match an event in one of those 
obscure generations by chance is unlikely.</p>

<p>A third lens appears on the other side of history, for eras that follow the birth of the Church. Those events must be related to 
the Church, Christian nations, the Jews or modern Israel. Again, this so limits the pool of possible matching events that
when a match is found, most subjectivity has been removed.</p>

<p>The fourth lens is significance. If the Word predicts a plague, history is replete with plagues. The clock based on the Ten Commandments
matches the plague of boils to the era of the Black Plague. That ranks as history's worst plague. Many of the prophecies in the clocks
match the most extreme example in history of the type of event predicted. Such rankings testify to the objectivity of the
clock interpretations. In this clock, for example, Job 12 prophecies a drought. It lines up with the Great Drought of the 13th century BC
that was spoken of in the book of Ruth. This is considered to have been the worst drought in recorded history. It ended the Bronze age, 
brought down empires and led to the such disorder that every major city in the eastern Mediterranean from Greece to Egypt was burned to the ground. </p>

<p>The odds that the forty-two chapters of Job would all have such prophecies that match historical events in chronological sequence 
by chance is vanishingly small.</p>

<p>All that is great, but finding the matches was hard. I am not the first person to try to mine sequential Bible chapters, paragraphs 
or verses for prophecies arrayed in chronological order. Years ago I read a book by J.R. Church, 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Prophecies-Psalms-Saying-Psalm/dp/0941241009">Hidden Prophecies in the Psalms: I Will Open My Dark Saying Upon The Harp</a>.
He tried to match each Psalm to a year of the twentieth century. A few Psalms matched their assigned year well but the rest were not convincing,
even to a credulous twenty-something. That soured me on the idea for decades. I would eventually make successful prophetic use of the Psalms in a 
systematic way in <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>. To get there, I had to start with a narrow focus, Psalm 119 by itself. Next, I
tackled the Historic Psalms and a few others. Later came the Thunder Psalms. Only after repeated attempts to discover the structure of the Psalms,
which is the most complicated Bible book by far, did I find a large structure spanning the whole book that incorporated fifty psalms (with gaps)
and another that made use of the first twenty-eight (without gaps). The punchline is this: even if you believe that a book contains a prophetic
clock and scrutinize its parts, if you do not guess the correct start and end years and number of periods, you will fail. It is impossible test all possible
combinations. That is why deciphering Solomon's poem was essential. It helped me crack several riddles and got me close with a few more.</p>

<h3>Back to Job</h3>

<p>Early on, I had identified a dozen or so reasonable matches for this clock in Job, but was still not convinced. 
My matches included the crucifixion of Christ and the Babylonian Exile. The Bible has so many prophecies of those
two events that finding them in the "right" chapters of Job proves nothing. Other matches were vague. 
I needed to find a rare but significant event so rich in prophetic details that the match was beyond questioning. 
When I reached Job 20, the clock parameters defined the corresponding era as falling in the years 338-219 BC. 
Without that timing information, I would never have discovered what was prophesied, the identity of a blasphemous ruler who died a painful death.
Previously, it was after I solved a series of Bible riddles that I inferred the clock that arranged them into a clock sequence.
With Job 20, for the first time I cracked a mystery using the clock itself to guide me. In science, a good hypothesis is one that enables you
to make accurate predictions about things not previously measured. In such cases, an experiment can be conducted after making 
the prediction which can confirm or reject the hypothesis. Job 20 confirmed my hypothesis. After that, I leaned heavily on the clock definitions
to tell me where in history to look for the fulfillment of prophecy. The result was the discovery of hundreds of prophecies that have
already come to pass. Many of those prophecies were not previously identified as such. Others were known to be prophecies by nobody had yet
figured out when they came true.</p>

<p>Here is a list of all forty-two eras for this clock, which runs from the Creation until Christ's return.
After that we will look at the mysterious ruler whose death was foreordained by Job 20, plus a few more 
prophecies from Job that are part of this clock.</p>

<p>Some of the eras are grouped together below. They correspond to runs of chapters having the same speaker in Job.
One of the most surprising discoveries was that the tone of the speaker in Job dictates the the tenor of the times.
A good speaker speaks of better times, while a bad speaker speaks of worse times. Thus Satan's chapters (one and two) were the
worst of times and match the fall of man and Noah's flood. Job's chapters were better times while his friends' chapters were worse times. 
The times matching the speeches of Elihu and God also have their own distinct flavor.</p>

<h3>Selections from Job's Chapter Clock.</h3>

<p>The prophecies in Job capture the full sweep of human history and warn of trying times to come.
It is impossible to believe this without seeing how detailed and accurate some of these prophecies are.
What follows is a sampling drawn from the following chapters in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dialog with History: Job 1-19</li>
<li><a href="./alexander-the-great.html">CSI Babylon: Job 20</a></li>
<li>The Second Half: Job: 21-37</li>
<li>Father Time: Job 38-42</li>
</ul>

<p>Predictive prophecy is a prominent target for those wishing to deny the supernatural and undermine trust in the truthfulness of Scripture.
A common tactic is to argue that if a prophecy is undeniably detailed and accurate, it must have been written after the
event happened. The earliest Old Testament fragments only date back to the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BC to first century AD).
The earliest New Testament testament fragments date back to the second century AD and the earliest complete New Testament (Codex Sinaiticus)
to the third century. Thus critics of Bible prophecy argue from silence. According to them, any prophecies of events that occurred
before the time of Christ can be discounted.</p>

<p>The more than two score prophetic clocks that I have found refute their arguments. If events from the last thousand years were
prophesied then there is no way for them to use this argument. Furthermore, if a whole sequence of prophecies in an unbroken strand
from ancient to modern times exists, then the accuracy of the newer prophesies proves more than just the truthfulness and divine origin
of the prophet's words about recent times. The prophecies of later times, being structurally bound to the prophecies of older times, 
prove that those earlier prophecies were written down before the events happened. The clock structure makes the whole set of prophecies
an all-or-nothing deal. It is God's secret anti-counterfeiting measure. If a later deceiver inserted a chapter, it would break the clock.
If they removed a chapter, it would break the clock. If they altered a true prophecy or tried to insinuate a prophecy of their own,
it would corrupt a structure they did not even know about. It is like an art forger who tried to imitate a painting but didn't know
that the true artist signed his work with a pigment that glows under a black lamp.</p>

<p>The preceding is preamble to one of the most remarkable prophecies I have discovered so far: Job 20. To my knowledge, no one has ever
spotted this prophecy. Read about it here:</p>

<p><a href="./alexander-the-great.html">The Death of Alexander the Great</a></p>

<p>Now here are a few shorter and sometimes subtler prophecies.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 9</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1647-1528 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Moses</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Exodus 2</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<h4>“My days are swifter than a runner;</h4>

<h5>they fly away without a glimpse of joy.</h5>

<h4>They skim past like boats of <strong>papyrus</strong>,</h4>

<h5>like eagles swooping down on their prey.</h5>

<h6>- Job 9:25-26, NIV</h6>

<p>The unintended irony of Job! He likens the swiftness of a boat made of papyrus – swift because it is so light –
to the course of his life; Job expected to die soon. In this era, what role did a boat of papyrus play? 
Not exactly a boat, a basket of papyrus rescued Moses from drowning in the Nile.</p>

<p>Later in the first generation of this era, Moses rescued his people from Egypt. </p>

<h4>“who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea...” (9:8)</h4>

<p>Is that not a poetic image of the people crossing the Red Sea?</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 12</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1290-1171 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Famine during Ruth's lifetime</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Ruth 1:1</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>This era fell in the middle of the time of the Judges, during the life of Ruth and Naomi.
In Ruth 1:1, we learn there was famine in the land. See what Job says: </p>

<h4>If he withholds the waters, they dry up;</h4>

<h5>if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land.</h5>

<h5>- Job 12:15</h5>

<p>You might say, “Anyone can predict a drought. They come all the time. Big deal.” 
Not so. Scientists concerned about global warming are attempting to
reconstruct ancient climates so as to understand our own times. They conclude that sometime between
1250 and 1150 BC, the Ancient Near East endured the fifty year “Great Drought”, the worst in recorded
history. It ended the Bronze Age, shattered empires and was the cause of the famine that made Ruth and
Naomi leave their home for Israel. Every major city between Pylos in Greece and Gaza was burned to the ground.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 18</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 576-457 BC</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Haman's genocidal plot against the Jews</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Esther</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>Job talks about a scheming man who suffers the fate he had intended to inflict on others:</p>

<h4>His strong steps are shortened,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>his own schemes throw him down</strong>.</h5>

<h4><strong>For he is cast into a net by his own feet</strong>,</h4>

<h5>and he walks on its mesh.</h5>

<h4>A trap seizes him by the heel;</h4>

<h5>a snare lays hold of him.</h5>

<h4><strong>A rope</strong> is hidden for him in the ground,</h4>

<h5>a trap for him in the path...</h5>

<h4>He is torn from the tent in which he trusted</h4>

<h5>and is brought to <strong>the king of terrors</strong>...</h5>

<h4>His roots dry up beneath,</h4>

<h5>and his branches wither above.</h5>

<h4>His memory perishes from the earth,</h4>

<h5>and he has no name in the street.</h5>

<h4>He is thrust from light into darkness,</h4>

<h5>and driven out of the world.</h5>

<h4><strong>He has no posterity or progeny among his people</strong>,</h4>

<h5><strong>and no survivor where he used to live</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Job 18:7-11,14,16-19</h6>

<p>Who was caught in his own trap? Who hung from a rope? Who ran afoul of a king? 
Whose children perished along with him, ending his family line? It was Haman, who was bested 
by Mordecai and Esther around 473 BC. In the Book of Esther, this influential court official 
persuaded the King of Persia to allow him and his allies to exterminate the Jewish people.
He set up a gallows so that he could kill a Jew named Mordechai, but ended up being hung on it himself.</p>

<p>One reason these prophetic clocks are difficult to interpret is that to get the full prophetic understanding
of an era, you must overlay the results from multiple clocks. By combining all the details, you see enough to
convince you that they are real. In Solomon's Celestial Clock, the story of Esther falls during "a time to kill".
Proud Haman longed to kill Mordechai and all the Jews. In <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>, another structure
in Job is revealed. Successive speeches in Job correspond to God's judgments against a series of ten empires,
one for each of the ten commandments. The judgement for breaking the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill",
falls on the sixth kingdom in the series, which is Medo-Persia. Here is a quote from the chapter 
"The Meaning of the Beasts of Job":</p>

<h4>All these empires practiced murder, but the Achaemenid dynasty</h4>

<h4>of Persia took it to a whole new level. From Cyrus the Great</h4>

<h4>to Artaxerxes V, about thirteen kings (depending on who is counting)</h4>

<h4>reigned from thrones drenched in blood. Seven were assassinated.</h4>

<h4>One was executed by Alexander the Great. One died later from a wound</h4>

<h4>inflicted by a would-be assassin. One died in war. At least three</h4>

<h4>killed family members or high-ranking noblemen. Artaxerxes III</h4>

<h4>took the cake, slaughtering eighty family members to secure the throne.</h4>

<h4>This lust for murder explains the casual way that Xerxes (likely</h4>

<h4>the ruler when Esther was queen) initially agreed to Haman’s plan</h4>

<h4>for genocide against all the Jews in the Book of Esther.</h4>

<h4>Yes, Persia needed to be taught the sixth commandment.</h4>

<h4>What if you add to this the fact that Mordecai uncovered and</h4>

<h4>stopped a plot against the king, thus preventing his murder?</h4>

<h4><strong>God displays his holiness and mercy even against murderous kings.</strong></h4>

<p>We can add to this results from the clock explored in the chapter "Solomon's Sundial", 
where this verse of Ecclesiastes corresponds to the era in which Esther lived:</p>

<h4>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man</h4>

<h5>more than ten rulers who are in a city.</h5>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 7:19</h6>

<p>The wise man who was strengthened was Mordechai. What was the evidence of his wisdom?
He loved his enemy, a king who oppressed his people, by disclosing a plot aginst him.
Surely this was a wisdom taught him by God. The "ten rulers who are in a city" were Haman's ten sons.
When they perished along with him, their family line ended. You do not need strength in numbers to win if
the One True God fights for you.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 24</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 138-257 AD</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Roman Persecution of Christians</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Revelation 2:8-11</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>The 24th generation was a mixed one. The church
spread, but so did persecution. In other generations, the
subject of the prophecy was a king, a conqueror, or the
savior. This time, the subject is the suffering church. In Job 24, Job is angry at 
the mistreatment of the poor who do not receive justice or relief from their oppressors. 
If you compare the hardships Job describes, persecuted Christians
endured all of them. Rather than get lost in the poetry, here is 
a dry recitation of the afflictions listed in Job 24:</p>

<ul>
<li>theft of land, flocks, donkeys, oxen</li>
<li>restricted freedom of movement</li>
<li>enslavement</li>
<li>loss of protection</li>
<li>lack of work opportunities</li>
<li>no clothes or shelter</li>
<li>loss of money &amp; possessions</li>
<li>children seized to pay a debt</li>
<li>lack of food &amp; drink</li>
<li>poor health</li>
<li>poor emotional well-being (groaning, crying out)</li>
<li>loss of life</li>
</ul>

<p>Paul listed many of these trials in Romans 8 and the
writer of Hebrews listed more in Hebrews 11 when he spoke
of the heroes of the faith. Looking back to the seven pieces
of peace based on Ecclesiastes 3, these depredations attack
all seven. In spite of such opposition, this generation of
history ended with Christians entering into the forty year
long “little peace of the church”. God listened to Job’s plea
after all.</p>

<p>Do not miss the implications of this chapter of Job. Thousands of years in advance,
God knew the suffering that His church would endure. Any who believe in God accept that 
He knows all things. That is not why God tells us these things. He tells us
these things so that we can know how much He cares. He tells us these things so that
we can know He has a plan to fix the world and that this plan takes our feelings,
our dashed dreams and crushed spirits into account. His is not a mechanical and impersonal plan.
It is a personal and an intimate plan for our restoration. God can handle our toughest questions:</p>

<h4>Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty,</h4>

<h5>and why do those who know him never see his days?</h5>

<h6>- Job 24:1</h6>

<p>He does set those times and He keeps them. We shall surely see His days come to pass.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 26</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 376-495 AD</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: Rome becomes a Christian Empire</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: Revelation 2:12-17</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>Job 26 has this to say:</p>

<h4><strong>“How you have helped him who has no power</strong>!</h4>

<h5><strong>How you have saved the arm that has no strength</strong>!</h5>

<h4>How you have counseled him who has no wisdom,</h4>

<h5>and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</h5>

<h4>With whose help have you uttered words,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>whose breath</strong> has come out from you?</h5>

<h6>- Job 26:2-4</h6>

<p>Though Job was mocking his opponents, this describes
what God was doing for his church in the 26th generation.
By making Rome a Christian empire, he helped a powerless
church. By providing ample resources and sending the
breath of God – the Holy Spirit – God raised up great
thinkers to counsel the church.</p>

<h4>He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters</h4>

<h5>at the boundary between light and darkness.</h5>

<h4>The pillars of heaven tremble</h4>

<h5>and are astounded at his rebuke.</h5>

<h6>- Job 26:10-11</h6>

<p>The “face of the waters” represents the people of the world. The circle is the Mediterranean world of Rome.
Outside that circle was the darkness of ignorance and unbelief, inside, the light of the gospel.
During this time, Rome split into two pillars, East and West. This mirrors Daniel’s prophecy of the statue with the
head of gold. The parts of the statue corresponding to Rome were the legs of iron.</p>

<h4>"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple:</h4>

<h4>and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:</h4>

<h4>and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."</h4>

<h6>- 1 Kings 7:21</h6>

<p>Solomon’s temple also had two main pillars. Jachin signifies <em>he shall establish</em>. 
As the right pillar, it was the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium. For its history, 
it represented the establishment church, with the tightest connection between church and state.
Boaz signifies <em>in him is strength</em>. This is the Western Roman Empire. Though it fell first politically 
and fought for centuries to survive the chaos of the mass migrations of Germanic and other peoples 
and attendant political instability, the west proved stronger, and became the agent
to spread the gospel to the greatest part of the earth. In the west, the church fought hard to be freed 
of the corrupting control of the state and finally succeeded.</p>

<h4>By his power he stilled the sea;</h4>

<h5>by his understanding he shattered Rahab.</h5>

<h4>By his wind the heavens were made fair;</h4>

<h5>his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</h5>

<h6>- Job 26:12-13</h6>

<p>Rahab has multiple meanings in the Bible. It can mean
insolence or pride, be a terrible sea serpent, or refer to the
woman of Jericho who protected the Israelite spies. It also
refers to Egypt. During this period, the church of
Alexandria reached the zenith of its influence within the
empire. Thus the shattering of Rahab could mean the
victory of the church over hostile forces within Egypt, such
as the Arian heresy, which began in Alexandria.</p>

<p>Since verse 13 refers to a fleeing serpent, Rahab here is
either a synonym for Leviathan, or a different beastly
empire posing similar danger to the faithful. In Job 41, God
challenges Job to pierce Leviathan with a fishhook. No
mortal can, but the immortal God can. What occurred in
this generation? Satan was bound (following the Edict of
Thessalonica in AD 380), causing him to lose control over the 
Roman Empire. The empire was caught on a fishhook, hence it
could be controlled and guided by the fisherman.
Remember how Jesus told his disciples that he would make
them “fishers of men”? The heirs of Saint Peter caught a really big fish!</p>

<p>This is not a trifling prophecy that Job was given. God took a weak, persecuted people in thrall
to the greatest and longest lasting empire the world has ever known and
turned that power over to them. This is the ultimate example of "How you have helped him who has no power".
Despite this, how many people do you know that turn to Job to understand God's prophetic plan for the world?
I read Job for years and saw NONE OF THIS. That is how spiritually deaf we are.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 36</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1566-1685 AD</li>
<li><strong>Subjects</strong>: England and the American Colonies</li>
<li><strong>Cross-reference</strong>: William Gilbert, James Ussher</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong>:</li>
</ul>

<p>If Job were written by a false prophet a thousand years after the real man lived, what would you expect?
The earlier prophecies would be detailed, because the author already knew the outcome; they happened before
he was born. Then as the prophecies go farther and father into the future, they would become more vague.
If they did match history, it would be a strange and subjective match, like something by Nostradamus.
Instead, what do we find? The details become clearer and richer. This is partly because I know much about recent history
and comparatively little about medieval history or before. It is easier for me to find matches to happenings since the Reformation.
Job 36 exhibits this nicely.   </p>

<p>The theme of Job 36 is “God is not powerless”. The aftermath of the Protestant Reformation
was scores of wars. The Thirty Years War alone claimed millions of lives, including half the population of Germany.
All those armies and soldiers proved unable to extinguish the Protestant faith, because God granted a measure of His
power to Lutherans, Calvinists, and other groups striving to worship God as their conscience commanded.</p>

<h4>He does not keep the wicked alive</h4>

<h5>but gives the afflicted their rights.</h5>

<h4>He does not take his eyes off the righteous;</h4>

<h5>he enthrones them with kings</h5>

<h5>and exalts them forever.</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:6-7, NIV</h6>

<p>God did grant the afflicted their rights. Consider the
strange wording here. He enthrones them not <strong>as</strong> kings, but
<strong>with</strong> kings. During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell
and the Puritans and other like-minded Christians executed
the king of England and briefly ruled England, not as kings,
but as a commonwealth with a parliament. How did
England progress to the point that such a large resistance
was able to rise up and oppose the crown? Furthermore,
many monarchs have been overthrown throughout history,
but they were always replaced by another king. Where did
they get the ideas and skills to fashion another form of
government, even if it failed after a short time?</p>

<p>They got them in school.</p>

<h4>God is exalted in his power.</h4>

<h5><strong>Who is a teacher like him</strong>?</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:22, NIV</h6>

<p>Lawrence Stone, in “The Educational Revolution in England 1500-1640”, revealed something remarkable.
Between the Reformation and the mid-seventeenth century, England built schools. Lots of schools! 
In fact, the number of schools increased more than tenfold. Puritans especially were keen to teach everyone h
ow to read so that they could read the Bible. England devoted one quarter of all charitable funds 
to the construction of schools and their endowment, so that the poor could be educated. 
By the end of this period, over half of all people in England could read.</p>

<p>This carried up to the college level. By 1640, Stone estimated that a minimum of 2.5 % of all Englishmen 
had a college degree. Don’t be fooled: that was a lot. After the civil war college enrollment dropped, 
due to economic and other reasons. It would not be until the 1930s – three centuries later – that the 
proportion of college educated men would again reach that number. Stone relates contemporary opinion of this development:</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century both natives and foreigners
were struck by the remarkable educational attainments of nobility
and gentry. James Harrington reminded his fellow-countrymen that
"you have, or have had, a nobility or gentry the best studied, and the
best writers (at least next to Italy) in the whole world". 
"I think the English Nobility and Gentry are now as learned as ever in any Age
they have been; and as the Nobility and Gentry of any other Nation
is", remarked Edward Waterhouse with truly English love of understatement.</p>

<p>So what was the basis for the English people to yearn for
and fight for a more just political order? They were the best
educated people the world up to that time had ever seen.
What of the Colonies they were planting in America?
Massachusetts required every town of fifty families to
support a schoolmaster, and every town of a hundred
families to build a school. The Puritans were crazy about
education and founded Harvard University in 1636, less
than two decades after the Pilgrim’s landed. Truly, who is a
teacher like him?</p>

<p>How about them Pilgrims? Consider what these verses might mean:</p>

<h4>He is wooing you from the jaws of distress</h4>

<h5>to a spacious place free from restriction,</h5>

<h5>to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:16</h6>

<p>That sure sounds like religious refugees “wooed” into leaving Europe, now celebrating the first Thanksgiving 
in a new place, “free from restriction”.</p>

<h4>Remember to extol his work,</h4>

<h5>which people have praised in song.</h5>

<h6>- 36:24, NIV</h6>

<p>Many have remarked about the “Hymn Explosion” of the 18th century, led by Isaac Watts, 
the father of the English Hymn. How much poorer would we be without 
“When I survey the wondrous cross”, “Joy to the world”, or “I sing the almighty power of God”? 
However, the bursting forth of song in that century was due to a revolution in this one, 
the 17th. The century began with metrical psalms whose authors
studiously avoided making changes to the words of the
Psalms that could make them scan and rhyme. This made
their doctrine sound at the expense of making many almost
unsingable. Most congregational singing followed a
responsorial form called “lining out”. Those “versified
psalms” continued to employ chanting styles and musical
forms from Medieval times. The century ended with “freely
composed hymns”. They were original English
compositions instead of translations, and were loosely
derived from Bible texts using a chord structure similar to
what we are accustomed to today. Edna Dorintha Parks, in
her 1957 Phd. Dissertation “English Hymns and their Tunes in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries”, 
explored the rich legacy of hymns from that generation that Watts and
his contemporaries had to build upon. We may have forgotten their songs of praise, 
but they were offered to God, and He heard them.</p>

<h4>He draws up the drops of water,</h4>

<h5>which distill as rain to the streams;</h5>

<h4>the clouds pour down their moisture</h4>

<h5>and abundant showers fall on mankind.</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:27-28</h6>

<p>The 17th century was plagued by the onset of the Little Ice Age, characterized by cold winters and wet summers.
This shortened the growing season by three weeks and caused glaciers to advance. The resulting crop failures
exacerbated the death toll from the wars of religion.</p>

<h4>See how he scatters his lightning about him,</h4>

<h5>bathing the depths of the sea...</h5>

<h4>He fills his hands with lightning</h4>

<h5>and commands it to strike its mark.</h5>

<h4>His thunder announces the coming storm;</h4>

<h5>even the cattle make known its approach.</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:30,32-33</h6>

<p>Were not the wars and revolutions of that time with their thundering cannon storm enough for this comparison?
With another prophetic detail, Elihu shines a light on a remarkable scientific discovery of that age, 
the magnetic model of the earth. The Englishman William Gilbert was the first man to use the word <em>electricity</em>. 
He wrote <em>De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure</em>, 
<em>On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth</em>. He not only put forth the idea that
the earth is a big magnet, he hypothesized that the center of the earth is made of iron. He believed (incorrectly) that
this magnetic force was what kept the moon in orbit around the earth. Though wrong, his ideas inspired
Johannes Kepler who later derived the laws of planetary motion. Gilbert also rejected the idea that the stars 
sat on spheres, and postulated that vast numbers of unseen stars existed beyond those we could see.</p>

<p>Given the connection to Gilbert’s theories of electricity
and magnetism as well as the thunder of war, these verses
refer to the scientific and political revolutions that were
about to unfold. Those two ideas would intersect in the
next generation in the person of Benjamin Franklin, who
demonstrated that lightning consists of electricity and also
agitated for that coming storm: the American Revolution.</p>

<p>To us, the arrival of storms is unpredictable. To God,
everything is timed to perfection:</p>

<h4>How great is God—beyond our understanding!</h4>

<h5>The number of his years is past finding out.</h5>

<h6>- Job 36:26</h6>

<p>In his two volumes on Biblical Chronology, published in
1650 and 1654 AD, Bishop James Ussher improved upon the
Venerable Bede’s work from centuries before. It is
impossible to comprehend prophecy when history is
disordered and mismeasured. This author would never
have made his discoveries if not for Ussher’s patient
scholarship. In every way, as we approach the Day of the
Lord, the church is making progress in deducing the full
and accurate meaning of God’s Word. “The number of his years” is still fuzzy, 
but before that day arrives, that number will come into focus.</p>

<h3>Chapter: Job 38</h3>

<p>In the chiastic outline of Elihu and God’s speeches in <em>Job Rises</em>, the theme of chapter 38 is 
“God speaks of his power”. The social upheaval and turmoil of this generation
and the one to follow it (our own) are His doing,
unparalleled in human history.</p>

<h4>The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;</h4>

<h4>Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?</h4>

<h5>Tell me, if you know all this.</h5>

<h6>Job 38:18, NIV</h6>

<p>Explorers searched out those “vast expanses”, with
Roald Amundsen in 1911 reaching the South Pole, the heart
of earth’s greatest “storehouse of snow”.</p>

<h4>Have you entered the storehouses of the snow</h4>

<h5>or seen the storehouses of the hail,</h5>

<h4>which I reserve for times of trouble,</h4>

<h5>for days of war and battle?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:22-23, NIV</h6>

<p>Those storehouses proved decisive against Napoleon in 1812.
First, the Russian Winter, worsened by the continuing
Little Ice Age, killed, crippled or captured hundreds of
thousands of Napoleon’s soldiers, humbling the largest
army ever assembled in Europe up to that time. This was
critical, because Napoleon’s treaties, alliances, and wars
were directed at isolating and weakening Britain, God’s
primary agent for eradicating slavery throughout the world.
After Napoleon returned from exile in Elba following his
first defeat, he was bested once more by bad weather.
Torrential rains contributed to his downfall at Waterloo in 1815.
What caused those rains? According to Caroline
Brogan, scientists finally have a logical explanation:
volcanoes.</p>

<p>In “Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo caused in part by Indonesian volcanic eruption”, Brogan lays out the case.
Six volcanoes erupted between 1808 and 1815 with a VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) of
four or more, the last being Mount Tambora in Indonesia
with a VEI magnitude of seven, the most powerful eruption
in 1,300 years. When volcanic ash fills the atmosphere, it
blocks the sun, cooling the earth. The major impact of the
final eruption was felt in 1816, the famous “year without a summer”.</p>

<h4>Have the gates of death been shown to you?</h4>

<h5>Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:17</h6>

<p>Snow in June and frost in August caused crop failure,
famine, and widespread typhus outbreaks.</p>

<h4>From whose womb comes the ice?</h4>

<h5>Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:29</h6>

<p>The death and suffering was felt worldwide. It forced
many New Englanders to migrate, accelerating America’s
westward expansion. Eery fog blocked the light of the sun
at midday. Mary Shelley and her friends in England
encamped together to wait it out. The macabre noctilucent
clouds, fog, and chill put them in a strange mood so they
challenged each other to see who could write the scariest
story. Shelley wrote Frankenstein.</p>

<p>The strangest effect of the volcano was on the
ionosphere. The ash short-circuited the earth’s electric
field, producing a pulse of cloud formation two months
later on the other side of the world, handing the victory to
Wellington and leaving England as Europe’s dominant power.</p>

<h4>What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed,</h4>

<h5>or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?</h5>

<h4>Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain,</h4>

<h5>and a path for the thunderstorm,</h5>

<h4>to water a land where no one lives,</h4>

<h5>an uninhabited desert,</h5>

<h4>to satisfy a desolate wasteland</h4>

<h5>and make it sprout with grass?</h5>

<h4>Does the rain have a father?</h4>

<h5>Who fathers the drops of dew?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:24-28, NIV</h6>

<p>Yes, God prepared the snow and ice for “days of war and
battle” and destroyed Napoleon's Grand Armee, one of the largest
armies ever assembled. He used volcanoes to disperse
lightning and cause condensation, literally fathering the
drops of dew.</p>

<p>God offered mankind this challenge:</p>

<h4>Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?</h4>

<h5>Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens</h5>

<h4>when the dust becomes hard</h4>

<h5>and the clods of earth stick together?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:37-38</h6>

<p>In 1891, Louis Gathmann first theorized a means of
seeding clouds using liquid CO2 to cause rain on command,
to tip the water jars of heaven. Practical methods would
become feasible during the next generation.
The laws of gravity were discovered during the previous
generation, but during this time, men like Gauss, Faraday
and Maxwell discovered the laws of electromagnetism:</p>

<h4>Do you know the laws of the heavens?</h4>

<h5>Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth?</h5>

<h4>Do you send the lightning bolts on their way?</h4>

<h5>Do they report to you,</h5>

<h6>‘Here we are’?</h6>

<h6>- Job 38:33,35, NIV</h6>

<p>How amazing! It was during this generation that mankind
learned just that – how to send lightning bolts on their way.
Samuel F. B. Morse, Leonard Gale, and Joseph Henry
created the Telegraph, which can report “Here we are” at
great distances. This was followed by the telephone (by
Meucci of Italy, Borseul of France, and Bell of America),
and electrical power transmission systems of Edison, Tesla
and Westinghouse. Truly, in those days, God spoke of his
power – electric power. Even Bell acknowledged this, for
his first Telegraph message was, “What hath God wrought?”</p>

<p>What God wrought during this period was to thrust
England into prominence as the greatest empire of all time:</p>

<h4>Do you hunt the prey for the lioness</h4>

<h5>and satisfy the hunger of the lions</h5>

<h4>when they crouch in their dens</h4>

<h5>or lie in wait in a thicket?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:39-40, NIV</h6>

<p>Who was the lioness? Victoria, Queen of England and
Empress of India. Britain’s symbol is a lion, and Victoria
ruled as its lioness for sixty-three years. She reigned longer
than all her predecessors and oversaw a massive expansion
of the British Empire. Many peoples fell prey to her navy. At
one point, Britain devoted a quarter of all expenditures to
fighting the slave trade on land and sea.</p>

<h4>Have you ever given orders to the morning,</h4>

<h5>or shown the dawn its place,</h5>

<h4>that it might take the earth by the edges</h4>

<h5>and shake the wicked out of it?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:12-13, NIV</h6>

<p>It was once said that “the sun never sets on the British
Empire”. For a time, a part of Britain was always seeing the
dawn. She took the whole earth by the edges (roughly a
quarter of all the world’s land and people) and shook the
wicked – slave traders – out of it.</p>

<p>And for her pride and thievery of the wealth of the
nations, for exceeding the authority granted to her by God,
England would be punished in the next generation by the
Second World War, then be stripped of most of her
colonies. As for this generation, it ended with the horror of
the Great War.</p>

<h4>Who provides food for the raven</h4>

<h5>when its young cry out to God</h5>

<h5>and wander about for lack of food?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:41, NIV</h6>

<p>God provided food for the raven, from the corpses littering the battlefields of Europe. 
The end of Job 38 announced the end of the great kingdoms and empires of Europe.</p>

<p>If you combine what we learn here in Job 38 with the results from other clocks, we better understand what God was doing
in this era. According to Solomon's Celestial Clock, this era was "A time to speak". It was the church doing the speaking.
In this era, God gave the church the telegraph, telephone and radio to facilitate the spread of the gospel.
Humans needed to master the science of electromagnetism so that we could create these inventions.
All that is named here, as well as the adventurous spirit to travel even to the South Pole in pursuit of this goal.
Anyone who can read Job 38 and not be in awe of how perfectly its words capture that time in history
is blind to its brilliance.</p>

<h3>Job 39</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Year range</strong>: 1923-2042 AD</li>
</ul>

<p>My book describes many societal changes prophesied in Job 39. That chapter is as marvelous as chapter 38. 
However, in the interest of brevity, I will only give one, which relates to God's speech about the eagle.
Who could that eagle be?</p>

<h4>Does the eagle soar at your command</h4>

<h5>and build its nest on high?</h5>

<h4>It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night;</h4>

<h5>a rocky crag is its stronghold.</h5>

<h4>From there it looks for food;</h4>

<h5>its eyes detect it from afar.</h5>

<h4>Its young ones feast on blood,</h4>

<h5>and where the slain are, there it is.</h5>

<h6>- Job 39:27-30, NIV</h6>

<p>The United States is symbolized by an eagle. We built a nest on a cliff higher than any other nation: on the moon.
The lunar module was named Eagle, and when we landed, Neil Armstrong said, “The Eagle has landed.” 
During this generation, America has enjoyed peace, but also fought in over forty wars. When we pursue our enemies, 
we see them from afar: using aircraft, orbiting satellites and drones.
This combination of two ideas – God’s plentiful provision
and reference to America – define America as the most
blessed nation the world has ever seen. Where is our gratitude?</p>

<h2>The Shepherd’s Clock</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Psalm 119</li>
<li>Book defined in: <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em></li>
<li>Chapter in book that describes it: <strong>Psalm 119: The Shepherd’s Clock</strong></li>
<li>Time span: 4020 BC–19 AD</li>
<li>Milestones: Creation to Incarnation of Christ</li>
<li>Intervals: 22 (one per 8 verse stanza)</li>
<li>Period: 119 years (except Adam &amp; Methuselah)</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the portions of the Bible that aided in my discovering and synchronizing the many prophetic clocks,
Psalm 119 was pivotal. I had found one clock whose period seemed to be 120 years (Solomon's) and another that was 119 years
(the Cosmic Chiasm). I was convinced I must be mistaken about one of them, but which? I was stuck. 
Until I resolved the question I could not make further progress.</p>

<p>Here is the final section of the chapter "Let's Synchronize our Watches" in <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>.
It describes my conundrum and how it is an example of a technique used by God to conceal His wisdom.</p>

<h3>The Punchline: Pride</h3>

<p>Why did I just waste a chapter of
this book talking about harmonization attempts that failed?
It comes down to trust. After clearing away problems that
could be resolved easily, two irreconcilable ideas remained.
One idea was the pattern from Job Rises that I began
working on about seven years ago. It was my baby and
sprang from my own imagination. It was the genesis of all
my work on eschatology, my first breakthrough.
The opposing idea was that “a time to uproot” must
encompass the years of the Babylonian Exile. In my spirit,
the conviction arose to trust the Word and not my own
ideas, however precious. I needed to admit that my own
ideas, which provided a good enough approximation to get
me started, needed to be revised. The pride of the scholar
is his fiercest opponent.</p>

<p>So it was not a bloodless argument about dates and
formulas. It was a stubborn refusal to surrender. How
consequential was this surrender? It almost caused me to
abandon my research; it almost prevented me from
discovering the most important prophetic structures and
writing the rest of this book. Every time a new idea
wouldn’t mesh with what I already had, I would tell God,
“That’s it! I won’t go any further.” Then I would pray for a
way to resolve the inconsistency. If I didn’t find a path
around the obstacle, I was ready to quit. God’s Word is
perfect. If my interpretation has obvious flaws, I will not
put it before the world. Deceiving others with clever ideas
just to bolster my pride is not something I am willing to do.</p>

<p>This work is both a creative and a critical process. Most
new ideas are useless and wrong, but unless you search for
them and work through them, you will never get to the true
and useful ones. You must alternate between flights of
fancy and careful parsing of Scripture, theology and
history. Sometimes you need to run a long way with a crazy
idea that lacks support just to see if it fits. When
mathematical and historical analysis suggested that periods
of 119 years fit some prophecies and those of 120 years fit
others, that seemed crazy. One had to be right and the
other wrong, but each had compelling reasons to be
accepted. However, if both are true, it goes a long way
toward explaining why these prophetic structures have not
been spotted before. That was part of “the glory of God …
[concealing] a matter”. Evidence for one can be taken as
evidence against the other, and so each pattern perfectly
hid the other.</p>

<p>Let’s unhide them! Let’s search out the glory of kings!
Next stop: Psalm 119.</p>

<h3>Psalm 119: More than a number, but not less</h3>

<p>How I interacted with this psalm over the years on my path to deeper understanding
offers a lesson in how to absorb wisdom from God's Word. The process is not linear.
Normal rules of hermeneutics will only get you so far. The wisdom books are filled with riddles,
parables and other devices designed to conceal God's intent. Only by careful study, meditation and
a worshipful attitude will you pierce those mysteries. You don't believe me? The Psalmist tells us it is so!</p>

<p>That solving God's riddles requires meditation and worship is told here:</p>

<h4>My mouth shall speak wisdom;</h4>

<h5>the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.</h5>

<h4>I will incline my ear to a <strong>proverb</strong>;</h4>

<h5><strong>I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 49:3-4</h6>

<p>The sayings are dark. Some are dark because they speak of evil days.
All are dark because you must shine light upon them to uncover their truths.</p>

<h4>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;</h4>

<h5>incline your ears to the words of my mouth!</h5>

<h4>I will open my mouth in a <strong>parable</strong>;</h4>

<h5>I will utter <strong>dark sayings</strong> from of old,</h5>

<h4>things that we have heard and known,</h4>

<h5>that our fathers have told us.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 78:1-3</h6>

<p>When I shone a light on Psalm 78, it unlocked wonderful mysteries, as recounted in the chapter "Psalm 78: Preparation of a Nation".
How did I shine a light on Psalm 119? First, I was inspired by it. The first time I read it, I was a new believer.
Family, MIT college friends and colleagues tried to argue me out of my faith. Most were older or smarter than I. 
Thus I found the courage to stand by my new convictions here:</p>

<h4>Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies,</h4>

<h5>for it is ever with me.</h5>

<h4><strong>I have more understanding than all my teachers</strong>,</h4>

<h5>for your testimonies are my meditation.</h5>

<h4><strong>I understand more than the aged</strong>,</h4>

<h5>for I keep your precepts.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 119:98-100</h6>

<p>When my heart was trapped in depression, unable to make good plans and follow through on them, these words offered hope:</p>

<h4>I run in the path of your commandments,</h4>

<h5>for you have set my heart free.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 119:32, WEB</h6>

<p>When I began writing my first novel, I decided that the hero needed to travel along a mystical road to get to salvation.
I called that road H Street, which stands for Holiness. It was based on Isaiah 35:8, which speaks of the <strong>Way of Holiness</strong>, 
a road on which no dangerous wild animals walk. That Bible passage (and other psalms) had set me free from nightmares 
(as recounted in <a href="./dreams.html">Dreams</a> ). However, Isaiah did not describe any landmarks along that road, so I came up
with my own. I decided to take one image from each stanza of Psalm 119 and make it into a statue or other fixture along the
road. A new landmark appeared every eight blocks of H Street, in keeping with how each stanza of the psalm has eight verses.</p>

<p>In my novel, a judge named Daniel eventually solved the riddle of H Street and the riddle posed by the images along its path.
By solving it, he was saved. He had lived a life filled with dread and anxiety, but now his heart was free.</p>

<p>By spending years writing my fantasy books, the idea that Psalm 119 is a road with a destination became fixed in my mind.
Thus when I began to wrestle with clock periods of 119 versus 120 years, my attention returned to Psalm 119.
To me that psalm was hope and direction down a road. It was freedom and conviction and love for God's Word. It was also a number.</p>

<p>Pastors and professors have long told me that the Bible's chapter numbers and psalm numbers and the arrangement of the parts
are not inspired. I believed them for years. I read books by people who disagreed and saw that their ideas were fanciful
and unsupportable by the normal rules of Biblical scholarship. That convinced me not to read anything into those numbers. 
Yet when I needed to decide if the number 119 had special significance, where else could I turn but Psalm 119?</p>

<p>The only way to prove whether the Psalm numbers or any other numerical values found in Scripture have meaning or not
is to try. If it leads to nonsense, heresy or a dead end, you know it doesn't work. Since the Bible doesn't tell us that
those numbers are meaningless, we are free to try. I tried. I have found that some numbers have meaning, but finding that meaning
requires employing many clues in addition to the numbers. Psalm 119 was the first psalm (I think) whose number guided
me to fresh insight. It was solely because of the number that I searched it for a prophetic clock. I was well rewarded.
I found a Generational Clock and it had a period of 119 years. This helped me decide that God employs different
periods among His clocks.</p>

<p>However, the most remarkable discovery was that the Shepherd's Clock leads us from Creation to Christ. It points to the savior.
Like H Street in my novels, it is a road that you can follow through history to find the savior.
Decades before logic and analysis enabled me to see the meaning hidden in this psalm, my heart had already started walking down that road.
That is how you solve a Bible riddle.</p>

<p>With that introduction behind us, here is that chapter and its generational clock in its entirety...</p>

<h2>The Cosmic Chiasm</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible book: Whole Bible</li>
<li>Books defined in:
<ul>
<li><em>Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life</em> (less precise)</li>
<li><em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em> (improved Chronology)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chapters in second book that describe it: <strong>Generations Come and Go</strong> and <strong>Two Patterns in History</strong></li>
<li>Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD</li>
<li>Milestones: Creation to Second Coming of Christ</li>
<li>Intervals: 42</li>
<li>Period: 119 years (except Adam &amp; Methuselah)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What is a chiasm (or chiasmus)?</strong> The <a href="https://www.chiasmusxchange.com/explanatory-notes/">Biblical Chiasm Exchange</a> 
gives a good definition. It is a literary device whose name derives from the Greek letter chi, which looks like an X.
If you arrange a chiasmus in two columns, with one idea per row, then the top item on the left will match the bottom
item or the right and vice versa. If you draw lines to connect the matching ideas, it will look like an X.</p>

<p>Chiasms are a form of inverted (also called introverted) parallelism. Ideas are presented in one order,
then the parallel ideas are presented in reverse order. A chiasm with an even number of steps will have a pair of matching
ideas at the center, while a chiasm with an odd number of steps will have many pairs but have an unpaired idea at its center.
In both cases, the core idea of the chiasm is likely at its center, not in first or last position as with the structures
I was taught in school. An example given on the website above is from the story of Noah in Genesis 9:6:</p>

<ul>
<li>(A) Whoever sheds</li>
<li>(B) the blood</li>
<li>(C) of man</li>
<li>(C’) by man</li>
<li>(B’) shall his blood</li>
<li>(A’) be shed</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bible is rife with chiasms.</p>

<p><strong>What do Chiasms have to do with Bible Prophecy?</strong> I learned the concept of chiasm from a teacher on Bible prophecy,
Ellis Skolfield. He showed how they appear in many Bible passages, such as the Book of Daniel. Detecting and
interpreting chiasms aids us in understanding prophecy. I took his idea and ran with it, coming up with my own chiasm,
one that encompasses all of world history. But before we get to that...</p>

<p><strong>Nature abhors a vacuum</strong>. We all like to know how the story ends. The Bible describes the apocalypse, but in terms that
mystify and horrify. Out of confusion, rejection of Christianity or religion in general, or sheer creativity, many people have
speculated about how things will turn out. How many books, graphic novels, TV shows and movies are about
the end of the world? A new one pops up every month it seems. They fill a void inside. We need to have SOME story.
The more fanciful and ridiculous, the better. It pushes the event far off. It helps us get on with our lives.</p>

<p>What if you are like me? What if you cannot settle for speculation and lies to comfort your anxious heart?
It is a question that never goes away. You may suppress it, push it aside to attend to other matters, 
or settle for what you know is a poor answer, a placeholder until something better comes along. What happens then? 
It stalks your dreams. Nightmares about how your world might be destroyed come to you unbidden. What can you do
to silence this voice of doom and find peace?</p>

<p>I will share the progression in my life as I faced this question, from childhood up to the present.
My posture went from entertaining my curiosity, to terror, to searching for someone else who had a ready-made answer,
to trying with inadequate tools to find my own, to finding a scholar who demolished all accepted ideas, leaving me 
with an intolerable vacuum of anxious ignorance. The goal here is not to prove that I am smart enough to solve the problem.
In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said, <em>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled."</em>
The goal instead is to prove the strength of my hunger to find an answer.  </p>

<p>As a child, I was obsessed with fantasy and science fiction novels. I loved time travel stories but was particularly
drawn to the idea that there were true prophets who could change the world because of their insight.
My sci-fi hero was Hari Seldon, the protagonist in the Foundation Series by Isaac Asimov. He used advanced mathematics
to create psycho-history, a means of predicting future events on a galactic scale. He foresaw an apocalypse,
the collapse of galactic civilization. He used his insight to create the Foundation, an organization that would 
preserve knowledge and guide the survivors to a hopeful future and shorten the period of anarchy and barbarism 
to a thousand years. (How interesting! The Christian church through its monasteries preserved ancient learning for 
a thousand years, until Europe arose from the Dark Ages a the time of the Renaissance and Enlightenment.)</p>

<p>My real-life hero was Alexis de Toqueville, a 19th century political scientist who in the 1840's predicted that 
the two rival world powers in the 20th century would be the United States and Russia. After reading his book
<em>Democracy in America</em>, I was astonished. How I longed to be one who could study history and politics and have 
the genius to foresee events a hundred years into the future! Those childhood years were when the future was to me a 
wonderful and hopeful prospect of unbounded possibilities.</p>

<p>Things changed when I reached college. I entered a decade of depression. After drifting away from the Roman Catholic Church,
but before I became a Protestant, I only picked up the Bible twice. The first time was to read Revelation, which disturbed me.
After I was saved, I had to contend with the influence of all the new Christians in my life, many of whom had
far-fetched ideas about the End Times. I read books like <em>Gorbachev: Is He the Anti-christ?</em> and
Hal Lindsey's <em>The Late, Great Planet Earth</em>. In 1986, we all were faced with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
People were saying that Chernobyl was the Russian word for wormwood which made it one of the plagues of Revelation.</p>

<p>In my journals, I tried to compare events in my world history text to the Bible and to the different 
eschatological theories. Nightmares about being savaged by wild animals, or being persecuted and in hiding, or
drowned in a flood tormented me for over a year, as related in <a href="./dreams.html">Dreams</a>. A speaker came to our
church to talk about his interpretation of Revelation. I asked him some pointed questions and concluded that he didn't know
what he was talking about.</p>

<p>All these voices were shouting about the end and I couldn't find any that made sense, so in the 1990's I got married,
had kids, and stopped looking into such things for over a decade. This didn't stop people from writing about comets 
hitting Jupiter or the smoke rising from burning Iraqi oil wells during the Gulf Wars. I absorbed their speculations 
and waited to see if anything they had to say came true. They were all wrong.</p>

<p>In the 2000's, two things hit me with emotional force. The first was hearing Johnny Cash sing 
<a href="https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/johnny-cash-the-man-comes-around-2">"When the Man comes around"</a>,
with its overt and haunting references to Revelation and other prophetic books. I saved it onto a CD and listened 
to it hundreds of times, mesmerized. The second was reading books by Ellis Skolfield. This man was different. 
He had studied prophecy for thirty years. He found inconsistencies in the existing End Times systems, like
Dispensational Premillennialism. He systematically demolished all of them. He did not have a complete system
to leave in their place, but some of his ideas seemed sound. I corresponded with him and he graciously answered my questions.
I reread his study notes on Daniel and Revelation many times. During this decade
I also wrote fantasy novels with apocalyptic themes. My imagination wrestled with the voice of the Seven Thunders,
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the wide road that leads to destruction and the final judgment.
I even dreamed up an elaborate legal system for the Courtlands of the afterlife!
Still, I was not satisfied. </p>

<p>It was now the 2010's and in place of a coherent story about how the world would end, I had a void.
I was certain of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did not know how the world would end, how to interpret Revelation, Daniel and the other prophets.</li>
<li>Nobody else alive did either, or at least they hadn't published their ideas yet.</li>
<li>This state of affairs was intolerable.</li>
<li>To research the problem and solve the riddle, meaning to assemble all the facts of history, theology and eschatology, resolve all the inconsistencies and form a coherent story would require an immense amount of time, theological ability and piety.</li>
<li>I lacked sufficient time to devote to the endeavor, having a difficult secular job and a wife and three children who needed me.</li>
<li>I lacked the training in Biblical languages and theology to succeed at the endeavor.</li>
<li>I lacked funds to pay for such advanced training, and indeed had crippling debts, being often on the verge of bankruptcy.</li>
<li>I lacked the emotional strength, confidence, discipline and perseverance to succeed at the endeavor.</li>
<li>I lacked the piety and holiness that God might reward by granting me success through supernatural gifting.</li>
<li>I lacked the cooperative personality traits that would facilitate joining with others to pursue this task jointly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those facts were a recipe for despair. There was only one way that God could life me out of it. He redirected me
to pursue a greater treasure. From about 2012 to 2015, I prayed and fasted one day a week. My prayer was simple.
"Lord, show me your glory." I did not know what form that glory would ultimately assume. As it turned out, 
it was a greater facility at seeing marvelous truths in the Bible. God gave me through prayer all that I lacked in the
other areas listed above. He guided me (via the internet) to hundreds of articles on history and theology, targeted
to my needs. He scheduled a pandemic in 2020, which gave me extra time for study because I did not need to waste twelve
hours a week commuting as I worked from home. He got me a better job, which enabled my family to make headway on our debt.
He gave me discipline and perseverance through the joy of discovery.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of my fast, though, when I as yet had none of these things, that the first idea appeared to me.
It was not persuasive. It had flaws. I could not yet see any Biblical support for it. After coming up with it, 
I put it aside for about five years until I finally saw where it fit and how to remedy its flaws and justify it from God's Word.
It was based on the ideas about Chiasms that I learned from Ellis Skolfield.</p>

<p>Where do all the other systems go wrong? They have the wrong framework, the wrong scaffolding upon which to hang the pieces.
They focus on the little details but miss the big picture. The Cosmic Chiasm was my attempt to step back from history
and take in the big picture. The goal was not to be precise, but to see gross features of God's plans. With that
in hand, it might then be possible to slowly refine it, sharpen the details and arrive at an improved view of the End Times.
Therefore this idea is not so much a theory of prophecy as a theory of history.</p>

<p>Once I had this gross, fuzzy, imprecise model of history, I could take the next step. I could see the good
in God's plans for judgment. It is not all destruction. It is creative destruction.
God first built up our world, our violent, tyrannical, oppressive civilization, like a building team
builds a scaffolding around the construction site. It is ugly but it has the rough shape that is desired. Then when all is ready,
the scaffolding is removed to reveal a beautiful, impressive structure. </p>

<p>The words of Revelation focus on the removal of the scaffolding, which is violent and destructive.
We see the terrors but not the triumphs. Because we see Revelation as only terrors, we cannot conceive that its events
are already underway. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have already sallied forth. They wreaked their havok over the last half a millennium, but they also did more. Religious freedom, the abolition of slavery, a freer economic and political order, relief from sexism and racism - all these things were the result of that destruction of the old world order. It was the genesis
of that way of thinking that propelled me to the conclusions I have found. It is my new hope in the love of God 
and His plans for us that enables me to see Revelation not as an apocalyptic movie, but as a song of joy.</p>

<p>My void is gone. It is full of good news. What follows are the two chapters from <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>
that describe the single idea that changed how I look at all End Times prophecy.</p>

<h2>The Acrostic Clock</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bible Book: Psalms 111 &amp; 112</li>
<li>Book defined in: <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em></li>
<li>Chapter in book that describes it: <strong>Acrostic Clock: Psalms 111 and 112</strong></li>
<li>Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD</li>
<li>Milestones: Creation to Second Coming of Christ</li>
<li>Intervals: 42</li>
<li>Period: 119 years (except Adam &amp; Methuselah)</li>
</ul>

<p>Psalms 111 and 112 are both acrostics. Each phrase (not verse) begins with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet,
in alphabetical order. This device suggests a sequence running to completion, which is perfect for a prophetic clock.
<a href="./psalm-119.html">Psalm 119</a> has a prophetic clock, so why not these two?</p>

<p>These two psalms fit together like peas in a pod, with Psalm 111 spanning the history from Creation until the coming of Christ
and Psalm 112 continuing from there to Christ's second coming, with a small overlap in the middle.</p>

<p>This clock is embedded inside a larger clock which spans the whole of the psalter. Details of that clock are found in
multiple chapters in <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em>.</p>
