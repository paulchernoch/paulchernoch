        <h1>Generational Clocks</h1>
        
        <p class="date">Published on 2024-06-09</p>
        
        <p>It was while lingering over the chronology in Matthew 1 about a decade ago that the idea popped into my head.
What if God measures time by generations of people, not days and years? From that sprang all the rest.</p>

<p>The five Generational Clocks that I have found are few in number, but they were the starting point. 
Without finding these clocks, I would never proceeded to the others, nor found so much more. 
This article will summarize such clocks.</p>

<p>God can measure time any way He pleases. The insight that led me to the idea of Generational Clocks was that 
people are more important than the sun, moon and stars. Humanity's most accurate clocks are based on the 
radioactive decay of atoms. Before that, we measured time by the reliable motions of the heavenly bodies. 
Because people count, God counts people.</p>

<p>In a Generational Clock, like human generations each tick can be a different span of time.
One generation overlaps the next, so some years may fall during the lives of two people on the clock.
A few of the generations may align with the lives of actual people, like Adam and Methuselah.
The rest are symbolic generations. There might not be an actual person whose life captures the theme
and span of years for that tick of the clock.</p>

<p>For each clock, the following will be given:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the clock</li>
<li>The chapters from my books that explain the clock in detail</li>
<li>Citations of the whole book or select chapters from the Bible that contain the prophecies</li>
<li>A table with the generation number, start and end years, Bible verse references and prophetic interpretation</li>
<li>Details about the most significant prophecies found in the clock</li>
</ul>

<p>I scoured the Bible for prophetic clocks. Some sequences of Bible passages that had a few good matches to history I rejected.
Unless every Bible passage (whether chapter, stanza or verse) in the sequence had at least one prophecy that was
fulfilled in the corresponding era, unless every generation between the first and last covered by the clock was represented, I discarded the idea and moved on. If God really intended that book or chapter to be a prophetic clock, it would be perfect.
No eras would be overlooked.</p>

<h2>History of the Idea</h2>

<p>My starting point was the genealogy in Matthew 1 which runs from Abraham to Jesus. The logical next step would have been 
to discover <em>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</em>, because that clock also runs from Abraham to Jesus.
However, I was not expecting any Bible passages or whole books to contain chronologically ordered prophecies.
Thus the first structure that I discovered was <em>The Cosmic Chiasm</em>, which is a general comparison of the Bible to world history.
From that clock I saw that God had a sequence for which aspects of culture and civilization he would tackle next in His plan
to redeem humanity. That was the key insight that enabled me to understand what God is up to in the story of the seven seals on the 
scroll in Revelation. With each seal that is broken, more than judgment occurs. God is building up a more just world.</p>

<p>In Ecclesiastes I discovered that there were several types of clock. The main one was Solomon's master Celestial clock based on the
twenty-eight times. In a chapter titled "Let's Synchronize our Watches", I resolved the question of how long each generation should be.
<em>Solomon's Celestial Clock</em> clearly required 120 years per period, but that didn't line up with <em>The Cosmic Chiasm</em>, which seemed to
require a period of 119 years. Two things helped me realize that the clocks needed to have separate but almost equal periods.
First was the story of Noah's Ark. Prior to the flood, God said that He would set a limit of 120 years for human life. That gives us
the 120-year period length. However, the flood ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, and <strong>7 x 17 = 119</strong>. In a subtle
way the same story gives us the number 119. Since Psalm 119 is one of my favorites and inspired major features of my novels, 
I turned to that Psalm to see if it had anything prophetic hidden in it. That was how I found <em>The Shepherd’s Clock</em>. 
Each stanza of the poem corresponds to one generation of history, with the first matching the time of Adam, the second the time of Methuselah,
and the rest successive 119-year periods.</p>

<p>My thought to search Job for prophetic clocks hinged on four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had just written <em>Job Rises</em> and was familiar with the material.</li>
<li>During that writing, I discovered many prophecies in Job but did not see any order to them, chronological or otherwise.</li>
<li>A also discovered in Job eight prophecies (and after the book was finished, a ninth) that pointed to Jesus which were in chronological order.</li>
<li>After <em>Job Rises</em> was finished, I discovered the Harvest Pattern in Matthew and observed that the Book of Job followed that pattern precisely. So when I discovered the similar Growth Pattern in Ecclesiastes, it was natural to check if Job conformed to that pattern also.</li>
</ul>

<p>Between three of my books, I would end up finding seven prophetic clocks in Job. However, the fact that the sequence in Matthew's chronology was
from Abraham to Jesus by none of my clocks matched it left me with the feeling that I was missing something.</p>

<p>Another perplexity was about the periods. I found clocks with many different periods. However, there was one period that many other writers on prophecy 
make much of that I did not see: the fifty-year Jubilee.</p>

<p>I can't recall what the final trigger was that caused me to spot <em>Job's Anti-jubilee Clock</em>. I do recall one observation that sealed the deal.
Matthew's chronology makes much of the number forty-two, by breaking history into three sets of fourteen names. By showing the number forty-two,
he hid the number fifty. The chronology has fifty names, whether of individuals or collections (like naming someone's brothers as a collection).
If you overlap generations of length fifty by one year, you get forty-nine years. Then if you divide the history from Abraham to a few years after Jesus' resurrection into forty-two segments, forty-nine years is the best fit for a period length.</p>

<p>Lastly, I discovered the <em>The Acrostic Clock</em>. I had found a pattern that encompassed half of the Psalms, but when I hit Psalm 112, the prophetic link
was weak. I noticed (as many have before) that Psalms 111 and 112 form a unit. They have the same length in verses and matching verses often use
the same phrases. The themes of the psalms linked up, as the end of Psalm 111 and beginning of Psalm 112 speak of the fear of the Lord.
However, the proper way to interpret these psalms is not by verse, but by poetic line. As the Hebrew scholars have long noted, each phrase begins
with a different Hebrew letter, ordered by the Hebrew alphabet. The psalms are acrostics. </p>

<p>Each psalm has an introductory "Praise the Lord!" followed by the twenty-two poetic lines. Since I had already found a clock in Psalm 119, another
acrostic psalm, it seemed sensible to search for another clock in Psalm 111 that ran from Creation to Christ. That would leave Psalm 112 to
continue the clock from Christ's First to his Second Coming. Since the two psalms had overlapping themes, it makes sense that they have overlapping
time ranges. The second half clock backs up to the generation before Christ, then proceeds forwards to the end of history.</p>

<p>What is the point of all this rambling? To find these clocks, I had to make numerous connections between Matthew, Genesis, Psalms, Job and Ecclesiastes.
If I did not have ready familiarity with these texts, this would never have happened. The Holy Spirit never said, "Go to Page 200 in your Bible" or some
such thing. If I ever was guided to make a connection, it was the Spirit amplifying memories that were already there. There is no substitute for
years of patient Bible study and reflection.</p>
