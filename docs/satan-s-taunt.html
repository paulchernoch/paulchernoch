        <h1>Satan's Taunt</h1>
        <h2>Psalm 91</h2>
        
        
        <h2>On Numbers</h2>

<p>I have an affinity for numbers. I inherited it from my mother, who studied Math at Duke. I inherited it from my father, who 
studied Physics at RPI. I received it from my Creator, whose gift of ASD gave me a generous helping of Hyperlexia. 
This passion runs me afoul of the received wisdom concerning the numericity of the Bible. The order of the Bible books, 
arrangement of the Psalms, and the division of it all into chapters and verses are not considered inspired, hence off-limits
when it comes to using them in arguments and proofs about doctrine and prophecy. In my book, this aversion to numbers
makes many truths hidden in the Bible into "Emotional Riddles" (as defined in <a href="./riddles.html">Riddles</a>). 
The emotion is the fear that going against the opinion of the majority of scholars creates. That fear erects a wall that 
keeps people out. Scholarly opinion is often right and helpful, which credibility is the timber making up the wall.</p>

<p>The opinion of scholars fills me with skepticism and caution, but if the numbers seem to be saying something, I will listen.
They guide me by suggesting connections, but the semantics of the text must back those connections up. I refuse to <em>a priori</em> rule
out a divine hand in the final arrangement and numbering of the Bible's components. As a result, I have found the order and often
the actual Psalm number to be relevant for about half of the Psalms. The relation of the Psalm number to the text that it labels varies.
Thus even when there is a relation of number to meaning, finding that relation is a riddle in itself. A few examples (covered in my books):</p>

<ul>
<li>Psalm 1 focuses on the Trinity, with each person represented, a numerological connection to the unity of God.</li>
<li>Psalms 2, 3 and 7 focus on the Son, Father, and Holy Spirit, respectively. Thus the psalm number matches the numerology of the content.</li>
<li>Psalms 1 to 28 match the twenty-eight times of Solomon from Ecclesiastes 3 (with Psalms 1 &amp; 2 swapped, for a special reason).</li>
<li>Psalm 102 prophesies the long struggle of Islam against Byzantium. 816 years elapsed between the capture of Jerusalem in 637 AD and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD. <strong>816 = 8 x 102</strong>. The factor of eight matches the eight verses in the psalm that speak of the fate of Jerusalem and the eight times of Solomon, six full and two partial, that correspond to the era during which the battles were fought.</li>
<li>Psalm 119 is an extended prophecy about the coming of the Messiah. The Bible has 119 mentions of the sin offering, which foreshadows Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Also, that psalm contains a Generational Prophetic clock whose period per generation is 119 years. Furthermore, the flood of Noah ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, symbolizing God's victory over sin. <strong>119 = 7 x 17</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I doubt that I have discovered the full variety of ways in which numbers factor into the interpretation of psalms.
A few years ago, while writing <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, I was entranced by Psalm 91. In order to solve it, my attention
spidered out through other psalms. They shared similarities that I thought might help me understand them all. 
In that book, I titled this section "A Spiderweb of Psalms: Psalms 58, 91, 102, &amp; 127". That section was tucked inside 
"Appendix D: To Number our Psalms". To really understand how I crawled back and forth between those psalms to eventually unravel all four riddles,
you need to read that whole seventy-five page appendix. This presentation will simplify matters and just focus on Psalm 91.</p>

<p>One part I minimize in this selective excerpt from the appendix is how I got stuck on Psalm 91 in the first place. 
It is because the number 91 is a triangular number, and I had been checking all the Psalms whose numbers are triangular
to see which were special. For the innumerate, a triangular number equals the sum of many sequential counting numbers
starting at one, with no gaps:</p>

<p><strong>91 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13</strong></p>

<p>Ninety-one is the thirteenth triangular number - and that is significant - because Psalm 91:13 is critical to solving the riddle of what 
this Psalm means prophetically.</p>

<p>(NOTE: Habakkuk is structured according to twenty-eight, the seventh triangular number: </p>

<p><strong>28 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7</strong></p>

<p>John 21 describes the second miraculous catch of fish, when 153 fish were caught. 153 is the seventeenth triangular number.
See <a href="./153-is-for-total-victory.html">153 is for Total Victory</a> for an exploration of both Habakkuk and the miraculous catch of fish.)</p>

<p>Psalm 91 poses two riddles. The first is the riddle I was hoping to answer: what does the actual number 91 have to do with the
meaning of the psalm, if any? That is a riddle peculiar to my interests which most people would not care about one whit.</p>

<p>The second riddle is one every one ought to want solved. The devil is most creative in his taunting.
He even quotes Psalm 91! Ah, but his selective quoting conceals a measure of irony
too heavy to weigh on a scale. Why did Satan quote that particular psalm? That is the true riddle!</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Satan’s Taunt</h2>

<p>How did I spend my time this morning two days before Thanksgiving? I meditated on Psalm 91. If the psalms associated 
with triangular numbers have more to tell, I want to hear it. Psalm 91 is the last triangular psalm that
isn’t historical and isn’t related to Solomon’s times or the length of a generation. Looking closely at the psalm 
did not offer any prophetic insight or satisfy my mathematical curiosity, but it did shine light on one of the most
important events discussed in this book: Satan’s temptation of Jesus in the desert. Let’s revisit temptation #2:</p>

<h4>Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on</h4>

<h4>the pinnacle of the temple and said to him,</h4>

<h5>“If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down,</h5>

<h5>for it is written,</h5>

<h6>“‘<strong>He will command his angels concerning you</strong>,’</h6>

<h5>and</h5>

<h6>“‘<strong>On their hands they will bear you up</strong>,</h6>

<h6><strong>lest you strike your foot against a stone</strong>.’”</h6>

<h6>- Matthew 4:5-6</h6>

<p>The devil has abridged these verses from Psalm 91:</p>

<h4>If you say, “The LORD is my refuge,”</h4>

<h5>and you make the Most High your dwelling,</h5>

<h4>no harm will overtake you,</h4>

<h5>no disaster will come near your tent.</h5>

<h4>For he will command his angels concerning you</h4>

<h5>to guard you in all your ways;</h5>

<h4>they will lift you up in their hands,</h4>

<h5>so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.</h5>

<h4>You will tread on the lion and the cobra;</h4>

<h5>you will trample the great lion and the serpent.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 91:9-13</h6>

<p>I never saw the humor and irony in the exchange before today. 
Who is Satan? He is the roaring lion:</p>

<h4>Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like</h4>

<h4>a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Peter 5:8, NIV</h6>

<p>Who is Satan? He is the serpent to be trampled by Eve’s true son:</p>

<h4>And I will put enmity</h4>

<h5>between you and the woman,</h5>

<h6>and between your offspring and hers;</h6>

<h4>he will crush your head,</h4>

<h5>and you will strike his heel.”</h5>

<h6>- Genesis 3:15, NIV</h6>

<p>Satan was taunting the Lord, to get him to trip up on verses 11 and 12 so that Jesus never makes it to verse 13, 
the declaration of his (Satan’s) doom. I like verse 13. I am glad Jesus didn’t stumble.</p>

<p>An earlier verse in the psalm is also both comforting and numerical. After speaking about a terrible plague come
these words that bring relief:</p>

<h4>A thousand may fall at your side,</h4>

<h5>ten thousand at your right hand,</h5>

<h6>but it will not come near you.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 91:7, NIV</h6>

<p>My attention was drawn to this verse partly because of the extravagance of the promise and partly because of the
numbers 1,000 and 10,000 – and I love numbers. Sadly, I can’t tie them into any of my prophetic clocks. 
(This is not for lack of trying! If there are 366 days in a leap year then...</p>

<p><strong>10,000 days ÷ 366 days per leap year = 27.32 leap years</strong></p>

<p>There are 27.32 days in a sidereal month, and Solomon’s times are based on a lunar cycle. 
Numbers will drive you mad…)</p>

<p>What happens if you put this all together? In Psalm 91, verse 7 is a promise of protection for the faithful 
and verse 13 a promise of defeat for the enemy.</p>

<p><strong>07 x 13 = 91</strong></p>

<p>Quaint, you might say. My eyes were drawn to those two particular verses in that particular psalm because of silly
mathematical ideas that went nowhere, their spiritual content and the excitement of discovery they triggered
when I tied it to Jesus’ temptation.</p>

<p>And another reason. 071391 is the combination code I chose a year or more ago for one of my electronic devices! 
I key it in several times a day. This “coincidence” will mean nothing to anyone but me. However, has the Lord ever
connected rare details of your life to his Word? Has God made one of his promises oh, so precious to you? 
When that happens, you know that your life is not an oversight, but part of His plan. When this happens, 
you know that the Lord has your number. When that happens, you know you can “rest in the shadow of the Almighty.” (Psalm 91:1)</p>

<p>May yours be a peaceful rest.</p>

<p>In progress...</p>
