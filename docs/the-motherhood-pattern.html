          <h1>The Motherhood Pattern</h1>
          
          
          
          <p><img class="center" src="images/cosmic-eve.png" alt="Eve as a Constellation holding the Earth like a baby"/></p>

<p>In college, I drew a picture for an art class assignment. I had hidden in the picture imagery from a novel about a murder,
<em>The Onion Field</em>, where the furrows in my field were shaped like onions, hid the outline of a buried corpse, 
and a cloud was shaped like smoke blowing from a gun.
To me it was obvious, but the professor didn't "see" it, so I got poor marks.</p>

<p>Most of us are like my art professor. We give God poor marks because when we read His masterpiece, the Bible, 
we don't see it. We don't see the subtlety, the power, and the glory concealed in its pages.
How do we find that glory? What can make blind eyes see and deaf ears hear?</p>

<p>You can't find it by reading theology books, though you may need those books on your search.</p>

<p>You can't find it by asking clever questions and embarking on a systematic exploration of logic, philosophy, and history,
though you will surely need those things, too.</p>

<p>You can't find it by asking the smartest and holiest people in the world to explain it all, even though almost none
of us can do without their guidance.</p>

<p>Job told us in chapter 28 of his book that no mortal can find the path to wisdom. Only if wisdom comes to visit you
will you make any headway. You must become the kind of person that Lady Wisdom wants to visit and who won't miss her
knock on the door if she calls. You must possess a searching heart that is passionate about finding her treasures.</p>

<p>Why did I discover the <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>? At risk of being expelled from college, 
I meditated daily on Habakkuk for eighteen months. The prophet lamented a ruined life and nation without a harvest 
but praised God nonetheless. I never once spoke or even thought the explicit words, "How do I bring in a good harvest?" 
I just felt it. I craved it. When over the course of decades after college I lost job after job, did I ever wonder, 
"What does the Bible say about how to live a productive life? What are the steps involved?" I should have, but 
it wasn't something that ever made it to the surface of my conscious mind. What did happen was that day by day, 
year by year, job failure by job failure, the urgency of finding an answer was hammered into my soul.
Like Solomon said,</p>

<h4>The words of the wise are like goads, and</h4>

<h4>like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings;</h4>

<h4>they are given by one Shepherd.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 12:11</h6>

<p>That urgent, passionate, desperate need primed my heart to be on the lookout for clues. Eventually it made its
way to the surface after the pieces were gathered but not assembled. Only at the end was I able to put it all together.
The same goes for the <a href="./growth-pattern.html">Growth Pattern</a>. I had no clue how to plan my life. As one born with
Asperger's, my deficiency in that area was crippling. Where others could lean on natural ability or good parenting
or training, I threw myself upon the grace of God. I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my forties. I didn't know
what my problem was or why. I just stumbled though life, but I stumbled with a longing to know what it was that
could turn the disorder of my life into a good and achievable plan.</p>

<p>Deep need, frequent prayer and faith in God kept me moving forward. Since God delights to answer such prayers,
I found first the perseverance to press on, then the right questions to ask, and finally their answers.</p>

<p>None of that explains how I discovered the Motherhood Pattern. Those other questions were about things 
that mattered to me. I needed the answers so I could better understand myself, get help and grow as a person.
I only discovered the Motherhood Pattern when I paused from my study, looked up from the book I was writing and 
realized that I was blind and selfish. I had found parts of God's plan for history, such as when He would liberate slaves 
and address colonialism, racism, and other evils. It was in looking for what I had missed that my error became
clear. In all that I had discovered, there was nothing about God's plan for women.</p>

<p>I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "God, what is your plan for the liberation of women from oppression?"
Over the course of the next week, He answered. That was December, 2020. In the years since then, I have found more.
This article extends ideas expressed in my books. I do not deserve the grace extended to me. I have no business
unraveling mysteries that my heart had not pursued. God gave me more that I could ask for or imagine.:</p>

<h4>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more</h4>

<h4>than all we ask or imagine, according to his power</h4>

<h4>that is at work within us, to him be glory in the</h4>

<h4>church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,</h4>

<h4>for ever and ever! Amen.</h4>

<h6>- Ephesians 3:20-21, NIV</h6>

<h2>The Mother of all Patterns</h2>

<p>The Motherhood Pattern is a feminine variation on the masculine Growth Pattern.
It is also a feminine specialization of the Harvest Pattern and the Journey Pattern.
It is anchored to the Law Pattern, whose command to Honor Fathers AND Mothers is foundational.
In addition, the lives of many of the Bible's noblest women can be used to illustrate the 
progressive infusion of the Seven Spirits of God into the hearts of the faithful.</p>

<p>The upshot is that only after I had discovered all those other patterns would it even be possible
to discover this one. It is the Mother of all patterns. If you take this pattern alongside
the Growth Pattern, the gross features of history make sense, not just qualitatively, but
quantitatively as well. The grand proportions of history are precise in measure and 
and in meaning they silence Solomon's ironic protests of vain futility.</p>

<p>The pattern is a parable. It sets forth the stages of development of an individual woman from birth
to full maturity, accounting for the trials of marriage and childbearing. Then it zooms out
and applies that pattern to the history of whole civilizations at different scales.
When one civilization begets another, the pattern begins again at a different scale.
At the largest scale, the pattern applies to all of human history, at smaller scales to the combination 
of Israel and the Church, to the birth of Rome, the genesis of the Reformation Church and the coincident
birth of modern Western Civilization. Most recently, it includes the birth of the new nation of Israel.
This article will map events such as birth, puberty, marriage, conception and childbirth to
their metaphorical counterparts in the history of each civilization.</p>

<p>The Motherhood Pattern does more than explain history. It explains God's purpose in requiring
Christian women to suffer so long under conditions of inequality. It offers a new model for 
ordination to service long overlooked by the Church. This last is critical.</p>

<p>In the Church, some stake out the traditional position that women must not serve as pastors and elders.
Others insist that in Christ, there is neither male nor female, so women should be permitted to be
ordained and serve in those roles.</p>

<p>Both positions are wrong! For a detailed look at this particular issue, read 
<a href="./against-complementarianism.html">Against Complementarianism</a>. Here is a summary of the 
main points:</p>

<ol>
<li>All priestly orders have been and must be authorized by God via an explicit divine revelation. <em>"And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was."</em> (Hebrews 5:4)</li>
<li>The start date after which candidates for ordination may be presented is given by God as well.</li>
<li>The qualifying characteristics of the priests or elders are given, such as personal character, sex or tribe.</li>
<li>The nature of the authority and religious practices of each such office are spelled out by God.</li>
<li>For a person to be ordained, they must offer a sacrifice of ordination.</li>
<li>What is acceptable as a sacrifice of ordination is also regulated by God.</li>
<li>That sacrifice must occur literally at some point in history.</li>
<li>The canon of Scripture is closed.</li>
<li>If women are permitted by God to serve authoritative roles in the church, such instructions must already be in the Bible.</li>
<li>No unambiguous extension of the requirements for ordination to the existing offices to include women may be found in the Bible.</li>
<li>If women are to be permitted to serve as pastor or elder, a new model of ordination must be found.</li>
<li>That model for ordination must have been instituted by a sacrifice that has already occurred in history and identified in prophecy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Until recently, I would not have been able to find a Biblically supportable defense of women serving as pastors 
or elders that satisfied all of those criteria. My choices would then be three:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deny that women have been so called by God on solid Biblical grounds.</li>
<li>Affirm that women have been so called by God but admit that I cannot fully defend this position.</li>
<li>Affirm that women have been so called by God on specious grounds using fallible human arguments.</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent over thirty years doing the first. Then I spent about three years doing the second. 
As hinted at above, in 2020 the Holy Spirit persuaded me that women are now permitted to be pastors and elders
but only revealed part of the Biblical justification for this. By faith, I openly professed my change of heart
and continued to study what the Bible had to say. Then near the start of this year (2024), I found the missing pieces.
I discovered the missing model for women's ordination, a prophetic clock that established the time frame for
its implementation, the nature of the sacrifice and the sign that it has already been offered and accepted by God.</p>

<p>I would never have found all these things if I had a laissez faire attitude towards Scripture. I accepted my ignorance
and the necessity of finding a complete answer. To my knowledge, no one else has discovered this solution to the 
problem. It is impossible unless you first reflect on the Motherhood Pattern. The heart of the pattern is found
in Job and so is the model for women's ordination. You see, Job is a parable for the suffering of women.
Because of this, since Job was ordained by God to a priestly ministry of forgiveness at the end of the book,
women are also ordained by the same ordination. Furthermore, the chapters of Job form a prophetic clock (as explained 
in <a href="./generational-clocks.html">Generational Clocks</a>).
That means that the passages in Job that relate to the commencement of that ordination to service are prophetically
anchored in time. Job tells us when God gave women the green light to become pastors and elders.</p>

<p>The above claims are substantial. Hundreds of pages in my books or in articles elsewhere on this website 
are devoted to providing the evidence to back up these claims. The rest of this article will address some of
the issues and objections that can be raised. I will begin with the biggest. </p>

<p>Q: Why would God make something so important as women's equality so murky? These ideas must be wrong.</p>

<p>A: Once I repented of my lack of interest in the plight of women, prayed to the Lord with humility, 
and asked a sincere question, the beginning of an answer came to me over the course of a week.
That gave me the tools and motivation to search for the rest of the answer.</p>

<p>The core of the answer is in Job, the first book of the Bible to be written. God caused the middle chapter 
of the Old Testament to be Job 29. And what is the middle verse of that chapter?</p>

<h4>The one who was dying blessed me;</h4>

<h5><strong>I made the widow’s heart sing.</strong></h5>

<h6>- Job 29:13</h6>

<p>That means that God's daughters are close to His heart. Widows were and are among the most vulnerable of people, 
without someone to protect them from harm. God sent his greatest prophets to help widows.</p>

<p>Important parts of the answer also appear at the proper place (according to the prophetic clocks in those books) 
in Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Matthew, and Revelation. Once you see the evidence,
you will realize that it is only because of the hardness of our hearts that we have for so long been unable to grasp
the plain meaning of what is written.</p>

<p>I wrestled with what is the logical order to present the information to follow.
Then I decided that I am tired of logic. As I meditated on the subject before sitting down before my keyboard,
one of the ideas from my books multiplied like bunnies. (There is a bunny chewing on my lawn thirty feet from 
where I am sitting on my patio.) Before, I had found a single political entity whose progress through history
followed the Motherhood pattern: the Church. Now I know of at least six! Seeing something new is exciting, so I am
going with exciting instead of logical.</p>

<h2>World History as the Literal Birth of Empires</h2>

<p><img class="wide" src="images/six-motherhood-patterns.png" alt="Table of Six Civilizations"/></p>

<p>Just as a woman gives birth to a child, so does one civilization give birth to another.
Before the last few years, that truism would have been as trite and meaningless to me as to most people.
It tells you nothing about how to live, to plan, or to understand this world. 
It tells you nothing but it could tell you everything <em>if you look close enough</em>.</p>

<p>When I wrote <em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>, I discovered things that turned my view of history upside down:</p>

<ol>
<li>The poem in Ecclesiastes 3 is a parable consisting of many metaphors that describe the course of a human life from birth to maturity in twenty-eight steps constituting seven phases, the <a href="./growth-pattern.html">Growth Pattern</a>.</li>
<li>The last few chapters of Ecclesiastes continue the pattern on through middle age to the times of physical and mental decline and death.</li>
<li>The poem is a parable for the development of spiritual Israel into the Church, then follows the church until it reaches full maturity in the faith.</li>
<li>The church is eternal; it will not decline and die. Only the twenty-eight times ending in "a time for peace"  affect it.</li>
<li>The world with its many cultures and other religions is not eternal; it will decline and die.</li>
<li>Thus the world's twenty-eight times must be extended to include another fourteen times (of shorter duration)  to bring it through middle age to its inevitable fall.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finding Solomon's Celestial Clock (for Israel and the Church) and the Grand Father Clock (for the whole world)
was exciting. They interpreted the times as they apply to men. Many of the times have an alternate meaning
when applied to women. For example, for men, "a time to tear" is a disagreement that must be resolved 
or even a civil war. For women, "a time to tear" is the day that she delivers her child.</p>

<p>When I later found the Motherhood pattern, I saw that it could also be applied to the Church.
When you do this, it shows that the Protestant Reformation was a time to tear, when the 
Roman Catholic Church gave birth to the Protestant Church. It also triggered a Civil war. 
Both the masculine and feminine meanings apply.</p>

<p><strong>Six Civilizations</strong>. This past week, I discovered six examples of civilizations giving birth in this way.
That is not the surprising part. What shocked me was that even though each of these parent 
civilizations began at different times and lasted different numbers of years, the numerical 
ratios between each phase of growth and the whole remains constant. God has literally stretched out the
history of these empires or cultural entities from his template and cut them to size.
This perfection in proportion proves that there is a divine ordering to history.
Knowledge of this divine ordering may only be found in the Bible, in the pages of its wisest scholar and king,
Solomon.</p>

<p>The table heading this section maps the historical time periods to empires, to historical events,
to Solomon's times, and by the colors in the left column, to key phases in a woman's development.
These are the empires:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The World</strong>. This encompasses all of human history.</li>
<li><strong>Rome</strong>. This follows Rome through its existence as kingdom, republic and empire.</li>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>. From the ashes of the Western Roman Empire rose a combative confederacy of nations, Catholic Christendom. This was a marriage of Church and state, neither pure empire nor pure church.</li>
<li><strong>Protestantism</strong>. Torn from Catholic Europe's belly by Reformation and revolution, a new religio-political entity arose. This was and is a different mixture of politics and religion.</li>
<li><strong>Modern Israel</strong>. The Jewish people were ripped from Europe by a Caesarian section during the Nazi Holocaust.</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual Israel (including the Church)</strong>. This is the true Kingdom of God, not identified with any human political entity and composed of all true believers down through history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the six entities above, five are mortal. They will come to an end. That includes the Roman Catholic Church and political Protestantism (such as what once governed the United States and many other nations). Only the true church will last for eternity. It will be fully manifested as a perfected visible and political entity only when Christ returns.</p>

<p><strong>Life Changing Events</strong>. To understand the table, first a word about the most dramatic phases of a woman's life:</p>

<ul>
<li>Birth (a time to be born)</li>
<li>Puberty (varies, but falls during the times to weep or laugh)</li>
<li>Marriage (often during a time to mourn)</li>
<li>Conception (often during a time to dance)</li>
<li>Childbirth (a time to tear)</li>
<li>Post Partum recovery (a time to mend)</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those life phases maps to a critical development in the history of an empire or cultural 
entity. In the table, birth is colored green, puberty blue, marriage and pregnancy pink, 
childbirth and recovery orange, and death red. Most cells in the table are left blank, to 
emphasize the remaining events, those that match these key phases. If you are curious about what goes in the 
missing cells, every one of the times of Solomon is matched to a historical event for the whole of world history 
in the chapter "A Grand Father Clock &amp; a Silver Cord", summarized in 
<a href="./celestial-clocks.html">Celestial Clocks</a>. Israel and the Church are similarly treated
in multiple chapters and summarized in the same article.</p>

<p><strong>Time Ranges</strong>. It is easy to pick a sequence of events in chronological order from the history of an empire
that tell almost any story. All you have to do is break the time line into ranges at arbitrary and convenient
places. That is why qualitative orderings of events are deceptive. Proponents of some theories of eschatology grab a set
of prophecies and insert specious and subjectively chosen time intervals between each pair of events to prove the
soundness of their arrangement.</p>

<p>In the case of these six instances of the Motherhood Pattern, the time intervals follow precise mathematical formulas 
built upon clues provided in Ecclesiastes and elsewhere. Here are the rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are two patterns: one for eternal entities and the other for mortal ones. </li>
<li>The eternal entities have twenty-eight growth steps of equal duration. They end with that kingdom achieving full maturity.</li>
<li>The mortal entities have twenty-eight growth steps of equal duration followed by fourteen more complete phases of a shorter duration and a thirteenth interrupted phase. They end with that kingdom entering a period of decline ending in destruction.</li>
<li>The basis for twelve of the remaining phases is twelve parables about the process of building a house in Ecclesiastes 10.</li>
<li>The basis for the next two phases is two calls to remember: one for days of darkness in Ecclesiastes 11 and one for evil days in Ecclesiastes 12. These phases are the days of mental and physical decline.</li>
<li>The ratio of the length of the growth years to the years of maturity and decline comes from studying human development and the life of Solomon.</li>
<li>Each growth phase of seven steps lasts seven years in the typical person's life, so the total period of growth is 49 years. This means that one of Solomon's times lasts 7/4 years (1.75 years)</li>
<li>A good estimate of Solomon's age at death is 63 years and a few months.</li>
<li>Thus the fourteen periods of maturity and decline sum to 63 - 49 = 14 years, or one year per period.</li>
<li>Taken together, each time takes up a portion of Solomon's life equal to 1.75/63 or 2.77%.</li>
<li>Each phase of maturity or decline lasts 1/63 of a life or 1.58%.</li>
<li>There is a final, short phase of unknown duration at the end of life, as a person nears death. That matches the last few months of Solomon's life; we don't know how many there were. That phase may last 1% or less of your life.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above proportions were applied to the start and end years for each empire to arrive at the ranges in the table.
That removes the subjectivity of when in history to look for the major events concerning each empire.
What does it show us? An important thing that this DOES NOT show us is that every civilization follows this pattern. Each of the civilizations on this chart are the subject of prophecy. 
They are not representative, they are special. One way they are special is how they are chained together.</p>

<p><strong>Six Civilizations, but only five babies delivered</strong>. </p>

<p><img class="wide" src="images/birth-of-empires.png" alt="Birth of Empires"/></p>

<p>In the diagram above, you can see a chain of civilizations, with each giving birth to the next.
Broad humanity produced Rome, whose partial collapse in 476 AD produced a decentralized Europe. Europe in turn
gave birth to the Protestant Church and cooperative democratic nations like the USA, which in turn helped pave the way for the creation of Modern Israel.</p>

<p>In a second track, taking Israel and the Church as a single entity (an Olive tree with natural branches 
and wild branches grafted in), you find a second parent to the Protestant Church.</p>

<p>No child is shown for Modern Israel. I doubt there will be one. Even if there is, it is in the future and 
I have no clue what it might be.</p>

<p>Now for some of the finer points of the earlier table. Each of the six civilizations passed through times 
that match the key transformational events of the Motherhood Pattern. Let's explain why the historical events 
are fitting realizations of parts of the pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Birth</strong>. Birth is the easiest to match.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The World</em> began with the Creation and Fall of Mankind. My best estimate for that event is 4020 BC, as worked out in <a href="./dating-the-creation.html">Dating the Creation</a>.</li>
<li><em>Rome</em> began with the founding of the city of Rome, traditionally given as 753 BC.</li>
<li><em>Europe</em>? When did the idea of <em>"Europe"</em> begin? You will not get historians to agree on a date. I chose 476 AD, the year of the fall of Rome, because after that there would be no turning back to the Rome that was before. Many linguistic, cultural, legal and religious traditions persisted to bring a measure of unity to the region, but not the strong central government of the empire. A new and combative community of nations arose. This decentralized civilization was a new development in the history of the world.</li>
<li><em>Protestantism</em> as a religious idea began when Luther posted his ninety-five theses on the door of a church in 1517 AD, but that is not the date used here. Protestantism as a political force got its start with a series of events. One was Luther's "Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation Concerning the Reform of the Christian Estate" of 1520, urging German princes to take up arms, defend Protestant truths and enable their subjects to practice them freely. Another was Sweden's adoption of Lutheranism in 1527, making it the first nation to become Protestant. Yet between public statements and political action, the true birth of the movement was when a single man stood apart from the church, calling for it to reform. In 1521, Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. The new church started as a church of one.</li>
<li><em>Modern Israel</em> was founded in 1948 AD as sanctioned by the new United Nations. The Jewish people who built this new nation did not do so in a vacuum, nor did they rely solely upon truths derived from their ancient faith. Much of how they structured their society and shaped their culture passed to them from the West, for better or for worse.</li>
<li><em>Israel and the Church</em> are politically distinct but the latter is the spiritual continuation of the former. I chose as its start neither the birth of Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Moses, nor David. Instead, I chose the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon in 960 BC. I wrote a whole book about why, but that is when Solomon's Celestial clock begins. God came down and filled the temple with His glory. Unlike the other civilizations, this was not birthed from a preceding corrupt human civilization. This civilization was born of God and will never end.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Puberty</strong>. When a man or woman reaches this time of life, big changes occur. They are emotional, intellectual and biological. When a civilization reaches this point in its development (in the times to weep and laugh), it 
often experiences a sharp discontinuity. The changes can be violent.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The World</em>. About a century prior to the Flood of Noah (matching a time to weep), it says in Genesis 6 that the Sons of God fell for the daughters of man. Some people think fallen angels cohabited with human women to produce a race of giants, the Nephilim. A likelier explanation is that men from the godly line of Seth intermarried with daughters from the sinful line of Cain, ruining the morals of Seth's descendants. This is in keeping with the theme of puberty: uncontrollable urges in the hearts of young people that if not checked by parents and society can ruin their lives. The next era (a time to laugh) was no laughing matter. God sent the flood. The world that resulted was as complete a break from the past as is possible to imagine. It included the establishment of capital punishment for murder, the beginnings of government.</li>
<li><em>Rome</em>. When Rome reached the puberty stage, its lust was not for women but for territory. The Punic Wars and the Roman-Seleucid War (plus other conflicts in this era) elevated the Roman Republic, making it the undisputed ruler of the Mediterranean.</li>
<li><em>Europe</em>. The <em>Saeculum obscurum</em> or "Rule of the Harlots" of the Tenth Century AD was a dark period for the Catholic Church. Instigated by Marozia and Theodora, literal sexual immorality, seduction, and the sale of church offices completely corrupted the church's leadership.</li>
<li><em>Protestantism</em>. The Pietism Movement of the 17th and early 18th centuries took "a time to weep" literally. The Holy Spirit revived the church, causing people to weep uncontrollably as they faced the guilt of their sins and pleaded with God for salvation. This was one of the roots of Evangelicalism.</li>
<li><em>Israel</em>. Modern Israel is in "a time to weep" right now. They mourn the dead, disfigured, injured, and raped victims of the despicable barbarism of Hamas, committed on October 7 and 8, 2023. May God have mercy on the souls of the dead and bring the wicked to justice. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><em>Israel and the Church</em>. The time to weep was the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The time to laugh was the growth of the infant church. At this time, how people understood and related to God underwent a cataclysmic change, just like a child passing through puberty to become an adult.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Marriage and Conception</strong>. Marriage is paired with "a time to mourn" and conception with "a time to dance". This reflects the reality that young women most often were married against their consent and lost most of their freedom upon marriage.
Before their wedding guests, their bodies might be dancing, but within their hearts they were mourning their new servitude. 
On the other hand, society placed great importance upon having children, so becoming pregnant was an occasion to dance.
Nevertheless, when a couple married, they separated from their parents to form a new household. They left. How does this 
jibe with the course of empires?</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The World</em>. The aspect of marriage most in view for this empire was the Tower of Babel and the dispersion of the nations. Like children leaving home after getting married, speakers of different languages left the land of Shinar and spread across the globe. The time to dance then matches Abraham receiving the news that his wife would conceive and he would be a father in his old age.</li>
<li><em>Rome</em>. The Roman Republic experienced a seismic change during its "time to dance". After the murder of Julius Caesar, it was transformed into an empire in 27 BC.</li>
<li><em>Europe</em>. In the eleventh century, a drifting Catholic Church found its mooring and launched itself in a new direction. In its "time to mourn", the Islamic Caliph destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in 1009 AD and harassed Christian pilgrims venturing to the Holy Land. At the same time, the millennial anniversary of Christ's departure came and went and yet he did not return, a great disappointment. On top of that, the Great Schism finalized the split between east and west. Problems like the Investiture Controversy and the Church's disability due to secular powers choosing its leaders rendered it powerless. Also, memories of the debauchery of the popes in the previous century and ongoing sexual immorality among the clergy were devastating to the reputation of the Church. Popes Alexander II and Gregory VII launched many reforms, including enforcing the celibacy of priests. The popes for the first time were chosen solely by the cardinals. Pope Alexander II authorized the Normans to invade England in 1066, further strengthening the church. Alexander blessed the launching of a holy war against the Moors on the Iberian peninsula, advancing the Reconquista. All these actions laid the political, military and philosophical groundwork for the First Crusade of the next era.</li>
<li><em>Protestantism</em>. The Great Awakening and political developments in America caused the Colonists to move in a different direction from Great Britain. The American Revolution would occur in the next era, but the groundwork was laid in this time, symbolized by the Boston Tea Party of 1773 and Britain's passing of the Intolerable Acts in 1774. In keeping with a new couple's drive to leave their parent's homes and set out on their own, millions of people left Europe during the preceding century to go to the New World.</li>
<li><em>Israel</em>. This era of Israeli history (2040-2059 AD) remains in our future. Based on the other prophetic clocks I have discovered, the likely manifestation of "a time to mourn" will be the opening of the Fifth Seal of Revelation. This will occur during "a time to hate" on the Solomon's Celestial Clock. A great persecution will break out against Jews. By the hundreds of thousands - maybe millions -  they will flee the Americas for Israel. "A time to dance" will be the safe resettling of many of them in Israel.</li>
<li><em>Israel and the Church</em>. In the larger clock, "a time to mourn" was Diocletian's persecution of Christians in 303 AD. The mourning ended when Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, ending persecution of Christians by Rome. This was followed by "a time to dance", when Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica, making Nicene Christianity the state religion of Rome. This marriage of church and state is one of the two strongest connections between an empire and the Motherhood Pattern.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Birth and Post partum recovery</strong>. Most of these civilizations gave birth to another. The verdict is out on modern Israel.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The World</em>. In Rome's "a time to be born" treatment above, that civilization was born in 753 BC with the founding of the city of Rome. In this treatment for the world's clock, Rome was "born" in 509 BC, when its last king was deposed and the Roman Republic was born. That seems more appropriate, as tearing can symbolize civil war and Rome had that in spades in this era. After that, the "time to mend" was Rome's acquisition of control over most of the Mediterranean as a result of the Punic Wars and the Roman -Seleucid War.</li>
<li><em>Rome</em>. Events in both halves of the Roman Empire signify the tearing. In 476 AD, Rome fell and the Western Roman Empire ceased to exist. In 532 AD, the Nika riots and other unrest nearly shattered the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium). The Plague of Justinian, numerous wars and the chilling effects of volcanic activity devastated the empire. What would become Europe was carved out of the remains odf the western empire and began to grow in a new direction. The post partum recovery would be Justinian's reversal of decline in the east and Pope Gregory the Great's brilliant diplomacy, vision and leadership in the west.</li>
<li><em>Europe</em>. None dispute that the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century was the birth of a new civilization. Many revolutions in philosophy, science and politics occurred in rapid succession, upending the world order. This includes the scientific revolution, the age of reason and eventually the industrial revolution. The wars of religion and the General Crisis of the 17 century spilled a lot of blood. This blood is the blood of post partum hemmhoraging, staunched only by the Peace of Westphalia and subsequent moves toward religious liberty and tolerance.</li>
<li><em>Protestant Christendom</em>. This civilization gave birth to modern Israel in 1948. It also nearly killed its child. The postwar period and the Cold War were the time of recovery.</li>
<li><em>Israel</em>. Will modern Israel give birth to another civilization? Only time will tell...</li>
<li><em>Israel and the Church</em>. Both Europe (as a political collective with a Christian facade) and the invisible church gave birth to the Protestant church in the 16th century.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using two dates for the "birth" of Rome (753 and 509 BC) that are centuries apart bothers me. It looks wrong.
Rome is a complex beast. Reflecting upon King Nebuchadnezzar's dream from the Book of Daniel was helpful.
In the dream, the king saw a single statue with a head of gold, shoulders and chest of silver, belly and thighs of bronze 
and legs of iron. Those four metals represent four empires, but the imagery is of one statue, one metal man.</p>

<ul>
<li>626 BC: Founding of Neo-Babylonian Empire - <em>the Head of gold</em></li>
<li>509 BC: Roman Republic founded</li>
<li>550 BC: Founding of Achaemenid (Medo-Persian) Empire - <em>the Shoulders and chest of silver</em></li>
<li>359 BC: Founding of Macedonian Empire by King Phillip II - <em>the Belly and thighs of bronze</em></li>
<li>190-64 BC: Roman Republic defeats Seleucid Empire (a remnant of Alexander's Empire), beginning with battle of Magnesia ad Sipylum in 190 BC, until full conquest in 64 BC.</li>
<li>27 BC: Founding of Roman Empire, where Rome finally becoming a beast - <em>the Legs of iron</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the above, it is clear that the development of Rome ran in parallel with the rise and fall 
of the three preceding empires on Daniel's sequence. A baby is normally delivered head first, 
so the legs and feet come out last. The feet were delivered in the latter phase of 
"a time to tear", but the head and shoulders came out earlier, in a "time to throw away", 
which ran from 695 to 520 BC at world scale. The belly and thighs came out of the birth canal 
with the conquests of Alexander the Great, starting with the defeat of Persia at the 
battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, part of "a time to mend". This was one messy delivery!</p>

<p>From the preceding we see that two intersecting prophetic metaphors are both satisfied. 
Rome arrived as a single kingdom or republic and as part of a collection of four empires that constituted a single statuesque entity. Only Rome's empire identity belongs to the statue, but
its existence as a kingdom and republic are included in the other reference to Rome as distinct from those three prior empires. The tides of history are complicated, but the Bible's 
prophets captured this complexity elegantly in the words they left for us to ponder.</p>

<p><strong>Death</strong>. One kingdom will never die: the Kingdom of God, given here as Israel and the Church,
formed into a single olive tree (Romans 11:17-24). Most of the civilizations on the list will end 
with the return of Christ, though some might be absorbed into Behemoth or Leviathan near the end 
and lose their identity earlier than my analysis predicts. Only one of these civilizations has already died: Rome.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Western Roman Empire died in 476 AD when Rome fell to Odoacer the Ostrogoth. In poetic fashion, Odoacer was assassinated on March 15, 493 AD. This mirrored the assassination of Julius Caesar on the same date, a crucial event that triggered the formation of the Roman Empire.</li>
<li>The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire died in 1453 AD with the capture of Constantinople, falling to the Ottoman Empire.</li>
</ul>

<p>This structure of history repeats the same pattern six times at longer and shorter time scales. Each nested pattern 
instance begins at the same place proportionally within the pattern enclosing it. This is the signature feature
of my system of eschatology, <strong>Fractal Historicism</strong>, as introduced in <a href="./the-end-times.html">The End Times</a>.
That these gross features of history may be so composed into a regular pattern is marvelous.</p>

<p>However, the use of the metaphor of childbirth to describe and quantify history might make women mad.
Has God likened the tribulations of history to the pain and sacrifice of carrying and bearing children
in a gratuitous way? Does this not rob women of the dignity of motherhood? Are their sacrifices not minimized by comparing
them to the monumental battles fought by men to set up empires and build civilizations?
The Book of Job uses words and images related to a woman struggling through a difficult pregnancy as an analogy
to the suffering that Job endured. Job was called the most righteous man alive. His unjust suffering was therefore
the worst suffering that anyone (male or female) ever endured (prior to Christ). That makes the suffering of the man, 
Job, greater than the suffering of women. The analogy seems to scream out which is the greater and which the 
lesser degree of pain.</p>

<p>Wrong. Once you understand the prophetic intent of Job and its Motherhood Pattern, you will find that the inequality symbol
points the other way. The virtue of the suffering of many women outshines that of Job. This follows via a proof by induction. 
With mathematical induction, first you prove a statement is true for a small number. 
Then you prove that if it is true for any number, it is also true for some larger number. 
If you do that, then by induction, the property is true for an infinite set of larger numbers.
Job is the small number. Millions of women down through history are the larger numbers.
What is the property to be proven? The property is the truth that if a person possesses and retains their faith in God
yet endures great suffering, by that suffering God will pour His wisdom into them.
Job refused to curse God and held onto his faith. The Lord then poured great wisdom into him.
Women have individually and collectively suffered greatly, both for their faith and generally due to the 
oppression that they have endured. If God remains true to His character, He will pour out a proportionally greater
blessing of wisdom upon the women of the church through the communication channel of suffering.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means that the suffering of Christian women for long centuries constituted 
a long spiritual pregnancy and the delivery of that child was the birth of the Reformation church.
This pattern is not a mere analogy. It is a spiritual reality. This suffering by women was not for no reason.
It had a glorious purpose and that purpose was fulfilled and continues to blossom.</p>

<p>The suffering of women is not an unending punishment by an unforgiving God. Nor is it just the wrath of Satan.
It is a channel by which God pours out immense blessings of wisdom upon the church and the world.
In <a href="./hannah-s-song.html">Hannah's Song</a>, I recount the spiritual blessing I received by visiting a 
dying woman of faith, Janet Sullivan. That blessing not only set me free from a decade of depression,
it twenty-five years later delivered the insight that unlocked for me much of the meaning of the Book of Job.
If not for Janet, I would not have understood Elihu or how this is all connected to God's 
eternal purpose for the suffering of women.</p>

<p>If God speaks to women through their suffering, what has he been saying? Lots! It is time to look in on
some of the most virtuous women in the Bible. </p>

<h2>Spirit-Filled Women</h2>

<p>There is a flow and a direction to the tide of the spiritual ocean on which we are adrift.
The tide comes in, then it goes out. We shall look at seven women into whom the Holy Spirit poured wisdom, 
then a second set of seven women from whom the Spirit's power poured out, doing great things in the world.
This symbolizes how we are first taught the truth when the tide comes in, then we act in truth and power 
when the tide goes out.</p>

<p>The first seven women lived during the time of the Patriarchs. The second set lived after that, on up until the
resurrection of Jesus Christ. These are not the only important women in the Bible. I have left out
Elizabeth, Anna, Martha, Huldah, and Jehoshaba and the women of Acts. (And Tamar. She scares me.) 
Because of this, I cannot decide whether the ordering of the revelations that I give is intentional 
or accidental. Even if the order is not as tidy as what I present, the comprehensiveness of God's gifting 
to women cannot be denied. Of this we can be sure. If God spoke quietly to women before Israel became a 
nation and firmly while it was one, surely he has shouted to the women of the church in the days since.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive?</strong>. How can we evaluate whether the Holy Spirit's communication to women has been comprehensive or not?
Isaiah 11:2 names for us the <a href="./seven-spirits.html">Seven Spirits of God</a>. This section will show that each 
spirit visited at least two women in the Bible, one during the time of the Patriarchs and one after that, 
up until the time of the resurrection. Like the tides, the first seven were visited by the Spirits in one order and the second seven in reverse. This forward and reverse listing of matching ideas forms a chiasm, a common literary device
found in the Bible. In a chiasm, the most important idea is the one at the center. In our case, that is 
the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>Are the spirits through with women? No! The letters to the seven churches in Revelation 2-3
address Christians throughout all ages. Each spirit holds in reserve the new wisdom needed by one church, 
in Isaiah's order (the forward order). If the Seven Spirits were delegated to visit those churches down 
through the ages, they will surely be visiting Christian women again. Among us may live another Miriam or Esther
or Mary. Once again, the last spirit to visit will be the Fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>The connection between the fourteen women whom we will soon study and the Seven Spirits of God is revealing. 
<em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em> provided evidence that each spirit has an affinity for one of the 
seven Bible books that constitute the <a href="./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a>. 
Indeed the order of the spirits governs the proper order of the pillars. Likewise, each spirit has an affinity 
for a different time in Solomon's <a href="./growth-pattern.html">Growth Pattern</a> and a different phase in 
Jesus' <a href="./harvest-pattern.html">Harvest Pattern</a>. Again, the order of the spirits matches the order of 
the steps in those two patterns. Also, when studying the drawing of <a href="./seven-spirits.html">seven swords</a> 
of judgment, one per millennium of history, the order of the swords also matched the order of the spirits. 
Revelation 5:6 tells us that the Seven Spirits of God were sent out into the earth. All God's plans are orderly, 
so they were sent out in order.</p>

<p>Now let's meet the fourteen women(or groups of women) and the spirit that visited each.</p>

<p><strong>The Earlier Women</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sarah - Lordship</li>
<li>Hagar - Wisdom</li>
<li>Rebekah - Understanding</li>
<li>Leah - Counsel</li>
<li>Rachel - Might</li>
<li>Jacob's daughters (Jemimah, Keziah, Keren-Happuch) - Knowledge</li>
<li>Miriam - The Fear of the Lord</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Latter Women</strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Rahab - The Fear of the Lord</li>
<li>Ruth and Naomi - Knowledge</li>
<li>Deborah - Might</li>
<li>Hannah - Counsel</li>
<li>Naaman's slave girl - Understanding</li>
<li>Esther (Hadassah) - Wisdom</li>
<li>A Trinity of Mary's (Mary the mother of God, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene) - Lordship</li>
</ul>

<p>For most women, the chronological order of their birth is obvious, so need not be mentioned. 
That leaves a few that need explanation.</p>

<p>First, though Jacob loved Rachel, he was tricked into marrying Leah first.
She was Laban's firstborn daughter anyway.</p>

<p>Second, though we do not know for sure when Job lived, evidence points to a time
between the lives of Jacob and Moses. This allows us to place his daughters before Miriam.</p>

<p>Third, we are not sure when during the time of the Judges that Ruth and Naomi lived.
Who came first, Ruth or Deborah? The famine that Ruth's book speaks of is most likely the 
Great Famine of the 13th century BC, a fifty-year famine that ended the Bronze Age and 
brought down empires. If so, the likeliest sequence of events is that the famine and a time 
of foreign oppression in Israel forced Naomi and her husband to flee to Moab. </p>

<p>Why Moab? After Ehud the Judge subdued Moab, Israel enjoyed eighty years of peace with Moab (Judges 3:30). 
A subsequent wave of oppression by the Canaanites in given in Judges 4:1-20. Only after that oppression 
ceased and brought improved conditions in Israel would it make sense for Naomi to return. 
That would only happen with the rise of a new judge in Israel. Based on the chronologies, 
the closest judge is Deborah. Thus the trials of Ruth and Naomi began before Deborah became Judge, 
but were resolved after Deborah and Barak's victory over Sisera.</p>

<p>Fourth and final, the Mary's can be ordered with Jesus' mother coming first since his birth happened first.
Then we must put Mary Magdalene last because she was first to see the risen Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Divining the Spirit</strong></p>

<p>For some of these women it is easy to identify a single one of the seven spirits that flowed into or out of them.
It is easy because so few words are used to chronicle their lives; the Bible has focused our attention on
one. For other women in the list, because more of their story is told, the operation of more than 
one spirit is evident. In this analysis, only the spirit that fits according to Isaiah's canonical ordering 
will be given.</p>

<p>In the following, a woman or group from the first list (from the days of the Patriarchs) will be paired with
a name from the second list (between the days of the monarchy and the time of Christ). Names will be taken
in forward chronological order from the first list and reverse order from the second, since they share the
same spirit.</p>

<p><em>(1) The Spirit of the Lord: Sarah and the three Mary's</em></p>

<p>Though more is written about Sarah than many other women in the Bible, the New Testament writers helpfully
focus out attention on one character trait: her faith.</p>

<h4>For this is how <strong>the holy women who hoped in God</strong></h4>

<h4>used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their</h4>

<h4>own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, <strong>calling him lord</strong>.</h4>

<h4>And you are her children, if you do good and</h4>

<h4>do not fear anything that is frightening.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Peter 3:5-6</h6>

<p>Sarah's faith was twofold. She had her own hope in the Lord and also trusted that her husband had heard from the Lord,
so by following him she was following the Lord. To leave her home country and do all the other courageous things
entailed by being the wife of Abraham required great faith.</p>

<h4><strong>By faith Sarah</strong> herself received power to conceive,</h4>

<h4>even when she was past the age, since she considered</h4>

<h4>him faithful who had promised.</h4>

<h6>- Hebrews 11:11</h6>

<p>This article is about God's plans for motherhood. It all began with Sarah. The Spirit of the Lord or Lordship
is the spirit that imparts faith. When Sarah laughed at the angel's words (Genesis 18:12), it showed that 
she needed more faith. Sarah's place in the Bible is not that she was special because she HAD great faith.
Her place was secured because she RECEIVED great faith. This spirit gave it to her.</p>

<p>In the Harvest Pattern, the first step is preparation. The essential preparation for every harvest is faith in God.
In the incarnation, that preparation was built upon the faith of Mary. She believed the words of the angel.
Just as faith flowed into Sarah to enable her to conceive, the Spirit of the Lord - nay the very Lord himself - 
flowed out ot Mary.</p>

<p>God is Trinity. The virgin birth was a physical miracle so demonstrates the power of the Father.
Mary of Bethany, sister of Lazarus and Martha, demonstrated the work of this spirit in a second way.
She sat at the feet of Jesus, listening and learning. Hers was faith that learning the Word as more important 
than any other responsibility (Luke 10:38-42). That leaves Mary Magdalene to represent the Holy Spirit.
She beheld the Spirit's power like none other. Are there Seven Spirits of God? Mary Magdalene was delivered
from seven evil spirits (Mark 16:9)! She was first in line to marvel at the risen Christ.</p>

<p>How marvelous that God worked through these three women, all named Mary, to reveal His nature as a Trinity 
to the world.</p>

<p><em>(2) The Spirit of Wisdom: Hagar and Esther</em></p>

<p>Wisdom is always borne of suffering. Hagar was a slave, mistreated by her mistress, who had fled into the
wilderness (Hagar 16:1-16). What did God do? His angel called upon Hagar to return to her mistress 
and endure more years of suffering. Only after this would she receive her boon, to become the mother of
many nations through her son Ishmael.</p>

<p>Just as God's wisdom flowed into Hagar, persuading her to follow a painful path to her goal, so
it flowed out of Esther. She listened to her uncle Mordecai's wise advice and asked others to pray and fast 
for her so that she might know what to do. After that she conceived and executed a plan that could have 
gotten her killed or exiled but instead led to the salvation of her whole people from genocide at 
the hands of Haman. As Solomon said, </p>

<h4>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man</h4>

<h4>more than ten rulers who are in a city.</h4>

<h6>- Ecclesiastes 7:19</h6>

<p>The nobleman Haman perished with his ten sons, his ten rulers in the city of Susa, the capital.
In that case, wisdom gave strength to a wise <em>woman</em>.</p>

<p>So we have two women, Hagar and Esther. By the spirit of wisdom one created a new nation and 
by that same spirit the second saved hers.</p>

<p><em>(3) The Spirit of Understanding: Rebekah and Naaman's Slave Girl</em></p>

<p>Understanding is bound up with worship. Its position in the Harvest Pattern then pairs it with the seed
of the gospel or of any incipient knowledge sent from God that has not yet grown and flowered into
its full implications and impact. To worship is to accept, take in and treasure that which flows from God.
In the story of Rebekah, Abraham's servant is sent on a mission to find a wife for Isaac.
When he believes he has found the right girl, he openly praises and worships God.
It was then up to Rebekah to decide if she believed and trusted this stranger from afar.
It is symbolic that Rebekah proved herself by her hospitality in offering to water the servant's animals.
It is a sign of her faith that when offered the choice to delay for ten days to say her goodbyes
or immediately leave for a strange place to marry a strange man, she responded like this:</p>

<h4>And they called Rebekah and said to her,</h4>

<h5>“Will you go with this man?”</h5>

<h4>She said,</h4>

<h5>“I will go.”</h5>

<h6>- Genesis 24:58</h6>

<p>Rebekah received the words of Abraham's servant into her heart and left her family. She understood them to be true.
She and her family received gifts of gold and other precious things from Abraham, but the second
woman of understanding received nothing. We don't even know her name. Syria warred against Israel
and captured many slaves. The commander of the Syrian army was named Naaman. His wife's servant girl was one
of the slaves captured by Naaman, as related in 2 Kings 5:1-19. Naaman suffered leprosy.
His servant girl then did something that makes her a hero of the faith: she loved her enemy.
She told her master, Naaman, about a prophet in Israel who could heal him of leprosy. That prophet was Elisha.
In a parallel to the story of Rebekah, water again comes into play. Naaman is instructed by Eliha to wash
himself in the Jordan seven times. (There is that number again!) Ceremonial washing is an act of worship.
Naaman almost refuses to do this because he thinks it stupid; it is the understanding of another of his
servants that persuades him to do it. At the end, Naaman begs Elisha for forgiveness in advance for 
standing at his king's side in a pagan temple in false worship, a thing he would be required to do.
How we need to be washed of so many filthy things!</p>

<p><em>(4) The Spirit of Counsel: Leah and Hannah</em></p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed, recited and believed by most Christians, Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant, we find
these words (with the disputed Filioque clause included in italics):</p>

<h4>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord,</h4>

<h4>the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father</h4>

<h4><em>and the Son</em>.</h4>

<h4>With the Father and the Son He is worshipped</h4>

<h4>and glorified. <strong>He has spoken through the prophets</strong>.</h4>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the Counselor and the voice of the prophets. The Holy Spirit is also the Giver of Life.
Both these women, Leah and Hannah, needed their Giver of Life. Leah was unloved by her husband.
Hannah was dearly loved by hers (but hated by her husband's other wife). Each was barren. 
Each hoped to be vindicated by the birth of a son. Their lives were intertwined prophetically.</p>

<p>Hannah prayed, <em>"The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn."</em> (1 Samuel 2:5b)
After pouring her broken heart out to the Lord, Leah bore six sons to Jacob plus one daughter. 
Leah is she who "has borne seven". Leah was the godly example that gave Hannah the faith to plead with God and believe Eli the priest's word when he blessed her:</p>

<h4>Then Eli answered,</h4>

<h5>“Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant</h5>

<h5>your petition that you have made to him.”</h5>

<h4>And she said,</h4>

<h5>“Let your servant find favor in your eyes.”</h5>

<h4>Then the woman went her way and ate,</h4>

<h4>and her face was no longer sad.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Samuel 1:17-18</h6>

<p>I read this story many times over the decades but only recently discovered the power of this verse.
After this word from Eli, Hannah walked away from the temple at peace.
The peace came BEFORE she got pregnant, not after. That is the proof of faith.
I can remember three times in my life when I was praying urgently for something and then stopped praying, at peace.
I stopped not because I got what I asked for or because I was giving up.
I stopped because, like Hannah, in faith I believed that God had heard me and promised to give me what I needed.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first such time was in 1991, after praying for about thirty minutes to be accepted on a mission trip that had already turned me down. </li>
<li>The second time was in 2005, after praying for over three weeks for healing when I lost hearing in my left ear and being told by a doctor that I would  not get my healing back.</li>
<li>The third time was in the mid 2010's, after praying and fasting one day a week for three years to see God's glory.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, the Lord gave me what I asked for: a place on the mission trip was extended by phone call minutes after I ended my prayer, the miraculous healing of my ear came two days after the doctor's discouraging word, and deeper insight into God's word arrived a year or so after my fast ended and continues to this day. This is called the prayer of faith. Many people talk about it. They have no idea what they are talking about. Hannah prayed the prayer of faith. Listen to her.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Counsel flowed into Leah and gave her seven children.
The Spirit of Counsel flowed out of Hannah and gave the world a great prophet, Samuel.
It also overflowed in her prayer. As related in <a href="./hannah-s-song.html">Hannah's Song</a>, her prayer in 1 Samuel 2:1-10
is an amazing prophecy of the future, structured according to the Ten Commandments and the Harvest 
and Growth Patterns. Hannah even hints at the existence of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom a century before Solomon
named them.</p>

<p>Why do I respect these women of faith? What caused my estimation of their value to soar? 
I followed the threads. I was trying to decide if I had found the seven pillars of wisdom,
only to learn that Hannah knew of them them first. 
<em>"For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world."</em> (1 Samuel 2:8c)
Surely her words were a source of inspiration even for Solomon!
Only once I began to respect the profound power in Hannah's prayer did I note the connection to Leah.
I had thought little of Leah, except pity. Not so Hannah! If Hannah was wise and filled with the Spirit,
surely the woman whose example helped her hold on through years of despair is worthy of respect.
God has used the suffering of barren women to deliver wisdom that in turn has blessed the world.
We can trace the path further. </p>

<p>Sarah -> Leah -> Hannah -> Samuel -> Solomon -> Habakkuk -> Elizabeth -> Mary -> Jesus.</p>

<p>By the Spirit of Counsel, no one has to be barren, no life be futile or vain.</p>
