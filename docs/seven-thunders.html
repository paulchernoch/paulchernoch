          <h1>Voice of the Seven Thunders</h1>
          
          
          
          <p>This article originally appeared as the chapter "Aftertaste: Donner &amp; Blitzen" in
<em>Peace, like Solomon Never Knew</em>. It tackles the riddle of the Voice of the Seven Thunders,
one of the greatest mysteries in the Bible.</p>

<p>Since this was the next to last chapter in that book, it draws frequently on ideas
developed earlier in the book. </p>

<hr/>

<h2>Aftertaste: Donner &amp; Blitzen</h2>

<p>On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen, on
Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen… Singing
Christmas Carols as a child was a joyful time. My
favorite of Santa’s reindeer was Donner, because our pet
German Shepherd was named Donner. Donner means
thunder in German and our shepherd’s bark lived up to its
name.</p>

<p>Studying the Bible and history and writing down my
discoveries initially brought excitement and peace. Once I
started editing the finished manuscript, a feeling of dread
grew inside me. So for this book, you will get – not an
“afterword” – but an “aftertaste”. In trying to understand
my heart, I recalled John’s words:</p>

<h4>I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand</h4>

<h4>and ate it. It tasted as <strong>sweet as honey in my mouth</strong>,</h4>

<h4>but when I had eaten it, <strong>my stomach turned sour</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 10:10</h6>

<p>Revelation 10 is the most mysterious chapter in the Bible.
I purposely avoided studying it for this book. By searching
for that passage on the sweet and sour natures of God’s
Word, I unwittingly read the whole chapter. A week later,
for no reason I can recall, I started looking up Bible
passages talking about thunder and lightning. Now avoiding
the mystery is a lost cause.</p>

<p><em>
Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was
robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the
sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars. He was holding a little scroll,
which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and
his left foot on the land, and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a
lion. <strong>When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write;</strong> but I
heard a voice from heaven say, <strong>“Seal up what the seven thunders
have said and do not write it down.”</strong> <br/>
- Revelation 10:1-4, NIV
</em></p>

<p>Halfway through writing the last book of the Bible, a
powerful angel delivers a loud message to the last Apostle.
Before he can write it down, Heaven’s editorial department
tells him to leave it out. The message is sealed, just like the
first scroll in Revelation 5, only no worthy lamb comes to
open this one.</p>

<p>The mystery of the seven thunders captivated me when I
began writing. My hero was zapped by heaven’s lightning
and charged with knowledge his conscious mind could not
fathom. Then in times of danger, thunder erupted from his
mouth and thwarted the villain’s designs. My plot device
may have been as corny as the Green Lantern movie, but it
sat at the center of my story and played a vital role in the
climactic scene of the last book in the trilogy.</p>

<p>My decade long passion for that passage is part of what
made me stay away from analyzing it for this book. I am not
objective and considered my imagination likely to invent a
meaning for it out of whole cloth. I tried to read a few
internet articles about the seven thunders, but the
interpretations I saw were fabulous – and not in a good way.</p>

<p>From Job, Ecclesiastes, 1 Timothy and elsewhere we saw
that God hides important messages behind emotionally
charged passages. Only the humble, prayerful and
determined can pierce the mysteries surrounding them.
Solomon said everything’s meaningless, so his book is
laden with meaning, and that the future is unknowable,
while laying God’s plan for all future generations. Job said
he couldn’t see or hear God at the same time he was
delivering prophecies of the Christ. So what about John?
Did the last Apostle seal the message from the angel
straddling land and sea by writing nothing, or by writing
riddles?</p>

<p>Is it all a big joke where the punchline is,
“Made you look!” ?</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>Is it all a big joke</p>
  <p>where the punchline is</p>
  <p>“Made you look!” ?</p>
</div>

<p>John’s reference to honey is an evocative warning.
Solomon primed us to be wary.</p>

<h4>If you find honey, eat just enough—</h4>

<h5>too much of it, and you will vomit.</h5>

<h6>- Proverbs 25:16</h6>

<h4>It is not good to eat too much honey,</h4>

<h5>nor is it honorable to search out</h5>

<h6>matters that are too deep.</h6>

<h6>- Proverbs 25:27</h6>

<p>Or recall Zophar’s warning to the arrogant man, shown
to be a prophecy of <a href="./alexander-the-great.html">Alexander the Great</a>:</p>

<h4>He will not enjoy the streams,</h4>

<h5>the rivers flowing with honey and cream.</h5>

<h6>- Job 20:17</h6>

<p>Alexander was buried in a sarcophagus filled with honey.
I want to bury my ideas with him, but the closer I look, the
more complete a picture emerges. John did seal up the
words of the seven thunders, but their report echoes
throughout God’s Word. Here, then, are the ripples
spreading out from the legs of the angel straddling the
shore of our turbulent sea.</p>

<h2>In search of thunder</h2>

<p>The tools to find the thunder are three: a Bible
concordance, a history text and God’s timeline. Use one
without the others and the message won’t show up. Use the
first two without the clocks painstakingly derived in this
book and you will only get half the message – the part that
remains in the future. You will miss the part that has
recently been fulfilled, the proof that God will certainly
keep His word.</p>

<p>Thunder, thundercloud, thundered, thundering,
thunders and thunderstorm collectively appear in about
thirteen Bible books. (It varies by translation.) When not
referring to horses’ hooves or human armies, it speaks of
God’s voice or the outworking of His power. The flood, the
parting of the Red Sea, or generic promises of God’s
judgment are sometimes in view. Thunder is most
commonly meant to provoke the fear of the Lord or show
forth God’s glory. A more focused reference appear in
Jeremiah:</p>

<h4>“‘The LORD will <strong>roar</strong> from on high;</h4>

<h5>he will <strong>thunder</strong> from his holy dwelling</h5>

<h5>and <strong>roar</strong> mightily against his land.</h5>

<h4>He will <strong>shout</strong> like those who tread the grapes,</h4>

<h5><strong>shout</strong> against all who live on the earth.</h5>

<h4>The <strong>tumult</strong> will resound to the ends of the earth,</h4>

<h5>for the LORD will <strong>bring charges</strong> against the nations;</h5>

<h4>he will bring judgment on all mankind</h4>

<h5>and put the wicked to the <strong>sword</strong>,’ ”</h5>

<h4>declares the LORD.</h4>

<h4>This is what the LORD Almighty says:</h4>

<h5>“Look! Disaster is spreading</h5>

<h5><strong>from nation to nation</strong>;</h5>

<h5><strong>a mighty storm is rising</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>from the ends of the earth.</strong>”</h5>

<h6>- Jeremiah 25:30-32</h6>

<p>In this chapter, God’s sword is drawn and named three
times, including verse 31 above. This connects the seven
swords to the seven thunders. The cup of God’s wrath
dominates the chapter, another connection to Revelation.
From previous analysis, recall that this passage was
partially fulfilled during the General Crisis of the 17th
century, when war spread to the ends of the earth. It will
be completely fulfilled during the final war near the time of
Christ’s return.</p>

<p>Though the word thunder appears but once, synonyms
like roar and shout bring the count to seven angry
denunciations in verses 30 and 31. That is a tenuous basis
on which to hang an association. Call it a resounding echo.
It does connect to what we are looking for, but we need to
move on to another prophet for clarity.</p>

<p>Thunder and its cognates appear most often in four books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revelation</li>
<li>Job</li>
<li>Exodus</li>
<li>Psalms</li>
</ul>

<p>Seeing that the word was scattered about five unrelated
Psalms and showed up five times in the narrative of a single
plague (of hail) in Exodus, it was easy to eliminate those
two books from the running.</p>

<p>Easy and wrong! Once I had enough material for a whole
chapter, I made one last pass through the concordance to
be safe and discovered I had overlooked important things.
First, I overlooked two psalms in my search, making seven
thunder psalms, not five. Second, even if we don’t know
what the seven thunders <em>say</em>, we can take comfort in what
they <em>do</em>.</p>

<h2>Psalms of Thunder: 18, 29, 68, 77, 81, 93 &amp; 104</h2>

<p><strong>Psalm 18</strong> is a masterpiece. Quoting but a few lines is a
travesty. Here goes.</p>

<h4>The <strong>cords of death</strong> entangled me;</h4>

<h5>the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</h5>

<h4>The <strong>cords of the grave</strong> coiled around me;</h4>

<h5>the <strong>snares of death</strong> confronted me.</h5>

<h4>In my distress I called to the LORD;</h4>

<h5>I cried to my God for help.</h5>

<h4>From his temple he heard my voice;</h4>

<h5>my cry came before him, into his ears.</h5>

<h4>The earth trembled and quaked,</h4>

<h5>and the foundations of the mountains shook;</h5>

<h6>they trembled because he was angry.</h6>

<h4>Smoke rose from his nostrils;</h4>

<h5>consuming fire came from his mouth,</h5>

<h6>burning coals blazed out of it.</h6>

<h4><strong>He parted the heavens and came down</strong>;</h4>

<h5>dark clouds were under his feet.</h5>

<h4>He mounted the cherubim and flew;</h4>

<h5>he soared on the wings of the wind.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 18:4-10</h6>

<p>This is a psalm about the Second Coming of Christ, when
he defeats the grave and overcomes death. Surely the seven
thunders spoke something about this blessed event, the
timing of which is Heaven’s most closely guarded secret.
Details of God’s tactics and weaponry may also be among
the secrets that John kept safe:</p>

<h4>Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,</h4>

<h4>with hailstones and bolts of <strong>lightning</strong>.</h4>

<h4>The LORD <strong>thundered</strong> from heaven;</h4>

<h4>the voice of the Most High resounded.</h4>

<h4>He shot his <strong>arrows</strong> and scattered the enemy,</h4>

<h4>with great bolts of <strong>lightning</strong> he routed them.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 18:12-14</h6>

<p>One of Job’s most potent exclamations of hope is this:</p>

<h4>My days have passed, my plans are shattered.</h4>

<h4>Yet the desires of my heart</h4>

<h4><strong>turn night into day</strong>;</h4>

<h4>in the face of the darkness light is near.</h4>

<h6>- Job 17:11-12, NIV</h6>

<p>Compare that to Psalm 18:</p>

<h4>You, LORD, keep my lamp burning;</h4>

<h4>my God turns my darkness into light.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 18:28</h6>

<p>This is a vital connection between these seven Psalms
and Job. More will follow. There is also a connection to
another favorite psalm of mine, the one at the end of
Habakkuk 3:</p>

<h4>He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;</h4>

<h4>he causes me to stand on the heights.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 18:33, NIV</h6>

<p>(I have enough material for an entire book on Habakkuk and the end times,
so we shall leave it at that. For lots about Habakkuk, 
see <a href="./habakkuk-part-1.html">Habakkuk Part 1</a>, <a href="./habakkuk-part-2.html">2</a>, <a href="./habakkuk-part-3.md">3</a>,
<a href="./habakkuk-part-4.html">4</a>, <a href="./habakkuk-part-5.html">5</a>, <a href="./habakkuk-part-6.html">6</a>, <a href="./habakkuk-part-7.html">7</a>
and <a href="./habakkuk-s-war.html">Habakkuk's War</a>. )</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 29</strong>. Moving on, the thundering of God’s voice is
one aspect of God’s glory that Psalm 29 extols.</p>

<h4>The voice of the LORD is over the waters;</h4>

<h4>the God of <strong>glory thunders</strong>,</h4>

<h4>the LORD <strong>thunders</strong> over the mighty waters…</h4>

<h4>The LORD sits enthroned over the flood;</h4>

<h4>the LORD is enthroned as King forever.</h4>

<h4>The LORD gives strength to his people;</h4>

<h4>the LORD blesses his people with <strong>peace</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 29:3,10-11</h6>

<p>In Revelation 10, the angel that spoke with the voice of
the seven thunders stood athwart land and sea. This
boundary symbolizes God’s wrath in judgment (the flood)
and His mercy in decreeing that the earth never again be
destroyed by a flood. By touching land and sea, that angel
stands in direct opposition to the two dragons that arise
soon after in Revelation 13, the beast of the land and the
beast of the sea.</p>

<p><em>“And in his temple, all cry glory!” (Psalm 29:9b)</em></p>

<p>What is the outcome of God’s glory? Verse 11 tells us
plainly. <em>“The LORD blesses his people with <strong>peace</strong>.”</em> For all my
digging into Job and Revelation, this simple fact escaped
me. Lots of plagues lie before us, so hold onto that word.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 68</strong>. Coming to this psalm, we hear tidings of a
war, but who is that war for?</p>

<h4>A father to the fatherless,</h4>

<h5>a defender of widows,</h5>

<h6>is God in his holy dwelling.</h6>

<h4>God sets the lonely in families,</h4>

<h5>he leads out the prisoners with singing;</h5>

<h6>but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 68:5-6, NIV</h6>

<p>God is not waging war for the wealthy, he is fighting on
behalf of the lonely and the prisoner. Equally important is
whom he wars against:</p>

<h4>Because of your temple at Jerusalem</h4>

<h4>kings will bring you gifts.</h4>

<h4><strong>Rebuke the beast among the reeds</strong>,</h4>

<h4>the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations.</h4>

<h4><strong>Humbled, may the beast bring bars of silver</strong>.</h4>

<h4>Scatter the nations who delight in war…</h4>

<h4>Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth,</h4>

<h4>sing praise to the Lord,</h4>

<h4>to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens,</h4>

<h4>who <strong>thunders</strong> with mighty voice.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 68:29-30,32-33, NIV</h6>

<p>Who is the “beast among the reeds”? As a beast, it
represents an evil human kingdom. Here it is shown
humbled and yielding tribute. We have seen a beast before
that matches this description but in opposition. In Job 40,
Behemoth is described as hiding among the reeds beside
the river and as receiving tribute from the other animals.
Behemoth is the beast from the land, one of the two
dragons in Revelation 13. Rejoice! God will compel
Behemoth to yield to His thundering rebuke.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 77</strong>. Spotting Behemoth hiding in Psalm 68 where I
had not spied him before was a surprise. It prompted me to
delve deeper. If Psalm 68 connects us to Job’s Behemoth,
Psalm 77 cuts to the heart of Job, in Elihu’s speech:</p>

<h4>I remembered my songs in the night.</h4>

<h4>My heart meditated and my spirit asked:</h4>

<h5>“Will the Lord reject forever?</h5>

<h5>Will he never show his favor again?</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 77:6-7, NIV</h6>

<p>My own “songs in the night” sung during years of
depression in college formed my bond with the book of Job.</p>

<h4>The waters saw you, God,</h4>

<h5>the waters saw you and writhed;</h5>

<h6>the very depths were convulsed.</h6>

<h4>The clouds poured down water,</h4>

<h5>the heavens resounded with thunder;</h5>

<h6>your arrows flashed back and forth.</h6>

<h4>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,</h4>

<h5>your lightning lit up the world;</h5>

<h6>the earth trembled and quaked.</h6>

<h4>Your path led through the sea,</h4>

<h5>your way through the mighty waters,</h5>

<h6>though your footprints were not seen.</h6>

<h4>You led your people like a flock</h4>

<h5>by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 77:16-20</h6>

<p>Here we find a reason to believe that since God’s
thundering voice parted the Red Sea to set one people free,
it will part our sea of troubles to set us free. Are we
ignorant of the precise words the seven thunders spoke?
For Israel God’s “footprints were not seen”. The words of
the seven thunders are the unseen footprints guiding us to
a new Promised Land.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 81</strong> speaks of Israel’s rebellion.</p>

<h4>In your distress you called and I rescued you,</h4>

<h4>I answered you out of a <strong>thundercloud</strong>;</h4>

<h4>I tested you at the waters of Meribah.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 81:7, NIV</h6>

<p>Like several other psalms in this cycle, this one directs
our attention to the Exodus and the time when God spoke
from the cloud to deliver the Ten Commandments.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 93</strong> again extols God’s glory.</p>

<h4>The seas have lifted up, LORD,</h4>

<h4>the seas have lifted up their voice;</h4>

<h4>the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.</h4>

<h4>Mightier than the <strong>thunder</strong> of the great waters,</h4>

<h4>mightier than the breakers of the sea—</h4>

<h4>the LORD on high is mighty.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 93:3-4</h6>

<p>Spot a theme? There are two thundering voices in the
world: God’s and Satan’s. God’s voice is the lofty thunder of
the thunderstorm. Satan’s voice is the clamoring of the
peoples, the sea of unsaved humanity. It is to calm and
overcome that sea and the monster that disturbs it that the
Lord has marshaled His strength.</p>

<p><strong>Psalm 104</strong>. Our seventh and final psalm of thunder is
Psalm 104. It reads a lot like God’s speech in Job. It
describes God’s care for all His creatures, like birds, storks,
goats and hyrax. It also takes up the flood as a major
theme:</p>

<h4>He makes winds his messengers,</h4>

<h4>flames of fire his servants.</h4>

<h4>He set the earth on its foundations;</h4>

<h4>it can never be moved.</h4>

<h4>You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment;</h4>

<h4>the waters stood above the mountains.</h4>

<h4>But at your rebuke the waters fled,</h4>

<h4>at the sound of your <strong>thunder</strong> they took to flight;</h4>

<h4>they flowed over the mountains,</h4>

<h4>they went down into the valleys,</h4>

<h4>to the place you assigned for them.</h4>

<h4><strong>You set a boundary they cannot cross</strong>;</h4>

<h4>never again will they cover the earth.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 104:4-9</h6>

<p>God has unilaterally disarmed himself, setting aside a
potent weapon: universal flood. Despite this, He playfully
introduces his final adversary:</p>

<h4>How many are your works, LORD!</h4>

<h4>In wisdom you made them all;</h4>

<h5>the earth is full of your creatures.</h5>

<h4>There is the sea, vast and spacious,</h4>

<h5>teeming with creatures beyond number—</h5>

<h6>living things both large and small.</h6>

<h4>There the ships go to and fro,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>Leviathan</strong>, which you formed to frolic there.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 104:24-26</h6>

<p>Leviathan will be the beast from the sea of Revelation 13,
that chaotic realm so often sung of in the psalms. To God, it
is His frolicking creation, to us, a deadly adversary, a
monstrous empire. How will God deliver us from its
clutches?</p>

<h4>When you hide your face,</h4>

<h5>they are terrified;</h5>

<h4>when you take away their breath,</h4>

<h5>they die and return to the dust.</h5>

<h4>When you send your Spirit,</h4>

<h5>they are created,</h5>

<h6>and you renew the face of the ground.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 104:29-30</h6>

<p>God will take away its breath, and will send His Spirit to
revive us, to resurrect us to new life.</p>

<p>What have these seven psalms told us about the seven
thunders? The mysterious voice spoke of our two great
foes, Behemoth and Leviathan, about God’s war for our
liberation, His plan for our peace, and His gift of eternal life
in the Spirit. That is a lot. It is enough to convince us that
the message that the angel gave but John “sealed” is every
bit as important as we imagine it to be.</p>

<p>Even Moses agrees.</p>

<h2>Unity of Psalms, Exodus, Job and Revelation</h2>

<p>Before we focus on Moses, let’s look at all four sources
holistically. As shown above, the seven thunder psalms
contain thematic and symbolic connections to Revelation,
Job, and Exodus. They are the glue that holds together the
clues we have about what was revealed by the seven
thunders. While they provide useful information in and of
themselves, they amplify through their endorsement the
voices of those three other books. They confirm that a
unified message concerning the seven thunders is present
in Scripture. Even if we are not able to comprehend all that
these books have to say, we can confidently return to them
again and again in search of additional insight.</p>

<p>These four books reach the number seven in different
ways. The Psalms reference thunder more than seven
times, but it is found in exactly seven psalms. Exodus has
exactly seven usages – if you rely on the Hebrew or NIV. Job
has more than seven, but only seven are about God
speaking; others are about nature or the thunder of men at
war. Likewise, in Revelation, if you remove the three
references to the seven thunders (which announce that
something was said without telling what), plus verse 9:9
about the thundering of horses in battle, you again get
seven.</p>

<p>Combining the numbers four and seven, you get twenty-
eight, the number of Ecclesiastes’ times. This numerical
clue is helpful as we dive into Exodus, because Moses
knows how to tell time.</p>

<h2>Plagues of Thunder</h2>

<p>Concerning Exodus, my first reason for rejecting it as
being relevant to understanding the seven thunders was
that it seemed to use the word thunder eight times, as I was
searching the ESV at the time. Looking in the NIV and then
the Hebrew Interlinear, I found it only occurs seven times.
The place in which translations differ is Exodus 19:19. Some
say God spoke “with a voice”, while other say “with a voice
like thunder”.</p>

<p>The second reason for rejecting it was that the analysis of
the seven swords produced a temporal pattern, where each
sword appeared once per millennium. Since five
occurrences of thunder in Exodus all concern the plague of
hail and the other two concern the giving of the Ten
Commandments, it would be impossible to derive a clock
from that data. My mistake! I expected the references to
thunder to divide time into segments. Instead, something
else divides time into segments, and the references to
thunder point to one special time. There is a clock: the Ten
Plagues on Egypt.</p>

<p>Before we get to that clock, let’s look at the two thunders
related to the giving of the Ten Commandments. They say
something I never noticed before.</p>

<p><em>
On the morning of the third day there was **thunder** and **lightning**,
with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a **very loud trumpet blast.**
Everyone in the camp trembled. Then Moses led the people out
of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the
mountain. Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD
descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke
from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently. As the
**sound of the trumpet** grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the
voice of God answered him.<br/>
- Exodus 19:16-19
</em></p>

<p>That trumpet blast is unusual. This ties Exodus to
Revelation 10, where the angel delivered his message in
anticipation of the blowing of the seventh and final
trumpet. Jesus is set to return at the last trumpet. The law
was also given at the blowing of a divine trumpet. We know
Jesus is the Word, the embodiment of the law. This tight
connection between Exodus and Revelation gives us
additional confidence to look closer at Exodus.</p>

<p>The passage from Exodus 19 relates what happened
before the law was given. Here is what it says immediately
after the commandments were given:</p>

<p><em>
When the people saw the **thunder** and **lightning** and heard the
**trumpet** and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear.
They stayed at a distance and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself
and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die.”
Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test
you, so that **the fear of God** will be with you to keep you from
sinning.” <br/>
- Exodus 20:18-20
</em></p>

<p>This again ties together thunder, the divine trumpet, the
law, and the fear of the Lord. Now we are ready to see what
the Plagues on Egypt can show us about God’s timetable for
judgement. Many previous clocks spanned 7, 28, or 42
periods, so are not fit models for this situation. The best
analog is Matthew’s Parable of the Ten Virgins. Adjusting its
start year and duration did not produce useful results, so
we will copy it unchanged. The Plague clock thus begins in
AD 1 and consists of ten periods of 240 years in length, a
season according to Solomon. In keeping with the other
clocks, the tenth period may be abbreviated by the Father
and conclude sixty to a hundred years early.</p>

<p>With the thunder passages centering on two parts of
Exodus, the seventh plague and the giving of the Ten
Commandments, it is fitting to combine them into a single
clock. Details from the first plague and first commandment
go with the first era, and subsequent eras match their
corresponding plague and command. The story is simple:</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>God backs up</p>
  <p>his principles</p>
  <p>with his power.</p>
</div>

<p>The quotes below are taken from Exodus 20 (NIV).</p>

<ul>
<li>1st Era: <strong>1–240 AD.</strong></li>
<li>1st Plague: <strong>Nile turns to blood</strong></li>
<li>1st Commandment: <strong>No other Gods (20:2-3)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, <strong>out of</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>the land of slavery</strong>. You shall have <strong>no other gods</strong> before me.”</h4>

<p>The first plague and commandment are the key to when
Moses’ clock must begin. The Nile symbolizes the river of
life in Revelation and the blood upon the river is the blood
of Christ, which sets the captives free from the grave. The
command to worship “no other gods” is echoed during this
time by Peter, who defies every king and every religion by
declaring:</p>

<h4>“Salvation is found in no one else,</h4>

<h4>for there is <strong>no other name</strong> under</h4>

<h4>heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”</h4>

<h6>- Acts 4:12</h6>

<ul>
<li>2nd Era: <strong>240–480 AD.</strong></li>
<li>2nd Plague: <strong>Frogs</strong></li>
<li>2nd Commandment: <strong>No Idols (20:4-6)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>
“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of
anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the
waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship
them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing
the children for the sin of the parents **to the third and**
**fourth generation** of those who hate me, but showing love to
a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my
commandments.”
</em></p>

<p>This second riddle helps us establish the duration of each
era in Moses’ clock: three to four generations. We already
know that Moses lived for 120 years, so with two streams of
information here, from plagues and commandments, a
season of 240 years is reasonable. The above quote
reinforces that if we consult the Psalms:</p>

<h4>Our days may come to <strong>seventy years</strong>,</h4>

<h4>or <strong>eighty</strong>, if our strength endures;</h4>

<h4>yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow,</h4>

<h4>for they quickly pass, and we fly away.</h4>

<h6>- Psalm 90:10</h6>

<p>For a strong person, three generations comes to 240
years. For an average person, three generations comes to
210 years and four generations, to 280 years. By these
tokens, we now have internal evidence from within the
commandments to establish when to start Moses’ clock and
how long to set for each tick.</p>

<p>With the victory of the cross over Rome and its
transformation into a Christian empire, God through the
church began to destroy the world’s idols. Divine
enforcement of the second commandment against idol
worship as binding on all humanity had begun.</p>

<p>The plague of frogs is a head scratcher and one of the
funniest stories in the Bible. Finding a historical match was
so hard that I nearly abandoned this section. Frogs in
kneading troughs, and bedrooms and in your servants’
quarters… Frogs everywhere! Unlike the deadly imagery of
the locust often used in Scripture, this comical description
calls for a less menacing action. Sometime between 300
and 375 AD, a mass migration of northern peoples began
and lasted for centuries. Germanic tribes crashed the
border and entered the Western Roman Empire. Wars were
fought, but it was the influx of foreign cultures, resurgence
of pagan ideas, and spread of the Arian heresy that were
the greatest threats.</p>

<p>One of the pagan tribes was the Franks. Clovis I was born
in 466 AD, near the end of this period. This pagan took the
throne from his father in 481 AD. What was emblazoned on
his crest of arms? Three frogs! In 496 AD, under the
influence of his wife, Clovis converted to Christianity and
became a staunch ally of the church. The plague of frogs
had ended.</p>

<ul>
<li>3rd Era: <strong>480-720 AD.</strong></li>
<li>3rd Plague: <strong>Gnats / Lice</strong></li>
<li>3rd Commandment: <strong>The Lord’s Name (20:7)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>“You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God,</h4>

<h4>for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless</h4>

<h4>who misuses his name.”</h4>

<p>The plague of gnats or lice (interpretations vary) is the
first of Moses’ signs which the magicians in Pharaoh’s court
could not duplicate by their magic arts. Their advice to
Pharaoh included a rare phrase, “This is the finger of God.”
Apart from the Books of Moses, this phrase appears only
once:</p>

<h4>But if I drive out demons by <strong>the finger of God</strong>,</h4>

<h4>then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</h4>

<h4>“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house,</h4>

<h4>his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger</h4>

<h4>attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor</h4>

<h4>in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.</h4>

<h6>- Luke 11:20-22</h6>

<p>The strong man – Satan – was bound in the previous era,
in 380 AD when Rome became a Christian empire. During
this era the church began to plunder his possessions, the
kingdoms of Europe.</p>

<p>Lice and fleas played a deadly role during this era.
Against the Egyptians, the plague was annoying. Against
Rome and Constantinople, it was deadly. From 542-543 AD,
the plague of Justinian killed over 25 million, the fourth
worst in history. Originally thought to spread mostly by
rats, it is now thought that human lice and other insect
vectors were the primary cause of its spread. This and the
volcanic eruptions that preceded it spelled the start of the
Dark Ages.</p>

<p>This leaves the matter of taking the Lord’s name in vein.
Several Christian heresies of this era denied the divinity of
Christ, but one stands out. This season of history gave birth
to the first religion in the world to explicitly deny the
divinity of Christ in its holy book, the Koran. Of all the
religions in the world that take God’s name in vain by
denying the name of God’s Son, none surpass Islam.</p>

<ul>
<li>4th Era: <strong>720-960 AD.</strong></li>
<li>4th Plague: <strong>Flies</strong></li>
<li>4th Commandment: <strong>Keep the Sabbath (20:8-11)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you
shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any
work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male
or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner
residing in your towns. For in six days the LORD made the
heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he
rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the
Sabbath day and made it holy. <br/>
- Exodus 20:8-11, NIV
</em></p>

<p>The ancient Jewish practice of keeping the seventh day
sabbath was opposed by Emperor Constantine, the Council
of Laodicea, and subsequent actions by the church.
Opposition began long before this era and grew intense
after it, with the Inquisition and laws against it from
Medieval to modern times. Abyssinian Christians,
Armenians, Scotts, and other churches on the fringe kept
the practice alive.</p>

<p>Christians considered the resurrection of Jesus Christ on
a Sunday reason enough to shift sabbath observance to a
different day. As a Baptist, I believe the day you observe the
sabbath a matter of conscience; we are not commanded to
make any day special. We certainly should not persecute
those who pick a different day. As a practical matter to
facilitate community worship and because the command
was given to liberate, not enslave, a weekly sabbath is
healthy.</p>

<p>However, shortly before this era began, Mohammed
taught his followers that God never wearies, so the story
that he rested from His labors after creating the world is a
lie. So this season saw a movement, not just against the
Saturday Sabbath, but all sabbath observance. The Muslims
hated church bells, banned the display of crosses and
fought to abolish or restrict many of the customs that
Christians practiced in observing the sabbath.</p>

<p>Muslim intolerance Christian religious practices has its
echo in the story of the plague of flies:</p>

<h4>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and said,</h4>

<h5>“Go, sacrifice to your God within the land.”</h5>

<h4>But Moses said,</h4>

<h5>“It would not be right to do so, for the offerings</h5>

<h5>we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God are an</h5>

<h5><strong>abomination</strong> to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice</h5>

<h5>offerings <strong>abominable</strong> to the Egyptians before</h5>

<h5>their eyes, will they not stone us?</h5>

<h6>- Exodus 8:25-26, ESV</h6>

<p>Recall Bishop Sophronius? When he heard the
conquering Muslim general voice his desire to build a
mosque (the Dome of the Rock) upon the Jewish Temple
Mount, he exclaimed, “The Abomination that brings
desolation!” The Bishop considered this action of the
Muslims to facilitate their worship of Allah to be an
abomination. During this era, Muslim’s considered
Christian worship practices to be an abomination.</p>

<p>In this era the Great Iconoclasm ran from 726–843 AD. It
was a fight over how to worship God acceptably. If you take
Moses’ lifespan of 120 years as a day, then counting seven
days from Christ’s birth, the sabbath day for worship would
run from 720–840 AD, coinciding with this struggle.</p>

<p>Concerning flies, the people of Europe spent
considerable effort draining swamps during this era and
afterward. Moses told Pharaoh that with this plague, there
would be a distinction. The flies would leave the Hebrews
living in Goshen alone. Perhaps the flies (or mosquitoes)
started to leave the Christians in Europe alone…</p>

<ul>
<li>5th Era: <strong>960–1200 AD.</strong></li>
<li>5th Plague: <strong>Livestock Plague</strong></li>
<li>5th Commandment: <strong>Honor Father &amp; Mother</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>“Honor your father and your mother,</h4>

<h4>so that you may live long in the land</h4>

<h4>the LORD your God is giving you."</h4>

<h6>- Exodus 20:12</h6>

<p>The animal plague known as Rinderpest is over 90% fatal
in cattle. People relied on cattle as draft animals for farming
and food distribution, so this plague decimated the
population. Rinderpest was once favored by
epidemiologists as the top candidate for the source of the
cattle plague in Exodus. More recent genetic studies point
to a predecessor virus from which two modern viruses
mutated: Rinderpest in cattle and Measles in humans. This
research postulates that the divergence occurred around
the 11th century, during this period.</p>

<p>From 966–968 AD, Rinderpest afflicted England, Wales
and Ireland. Evidence points to it ravaging Switzerland at
about the same time. Reports of other outbreaks during
this era have been found in the writings of Islamic scholars.
Recurrences of an age old scourge during this era are
unremarkable. What followed is not.</p>

<p>At the end of this era was born the scourge of Asia and
Europe: Genghis Khan. His great invasion would come a
few decades later, but a legend of his military genius ties
him to this era and this plague. The Mongols were
herdsman. Horses, cattle (including yaks), camels, sheep
and goats were their wealth and their weapons of war.
Rinderpest and other cattle diseases were indigenous to
Central Asia. The legend is that Genghis Khan intentionally
sold diseased cattle to his neighbors to his west. Once the
plague took out their cattle and starvation set in, his forces
would invade and conquer a weakened people. This would
make him the first known practitioner of biological warfare.</p>

<p>Two possibilities are likely. One: he did it on purpose and
this tactic explains his rapid conquest of the largest
contiguous empire the world has ever seen. Two: he didn’t
do it, but a large outbreak spread along the Silk Road in the
late 12th century, spared the Mongols’ herds, and he
capitalized on the destruction to begin his military
campaign. From this, the Mongols became a greater
scourge than the plague ever was.</p>

<p>From plague we move to commandment. During this era,
the Catholic Church promulgated the doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception of Mary; other Marian doctrines
also began to be debated. Likewise, the study of Joseph was
begun by the Benedictines in the 12th century, to be
enlarged by Thomas Aquinas in the 13th.</p>

<p>As a Protestant, I am dumbfounded! The view of a
corrupt, doctrinally confused, and superstitious Catholic
Church of the Middle Ages that I inherited from my culture
and my Protestant readings requires rethinking. Moses
commanded, “Honor your father and your mother”. The
Catholic Church of the 11th to 13th centuries obeyed that
command with passion and piety – as prophesied! They
honored Jesus’ mother and father. Shall we not do likewise?</p>

<p>The fifth commandment is the only commandment with a promise: 
<em>“that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you”.</em> 
During this era, the Medieval Warm
Period in conjunction with many innovations in agriculture
doubled grain yields and tripled the amount of food
available for human consumption in Europe. Life
expectancy increased dramatically, from 25 to 35 years.
The population doubled. The church honored its savior’s
father and mother and reaped the promised blessing. God
is true to his Word.</p>

<p>As a postscript to this, on November 10, 2021, weeks after
making this discovery, I shared my ideas about the Marian
doctrines being confirmed by this prophecy of Moses with
a Catholic neighbor and close friend named Paul. I had just
attended my church’s Zoom Bible study meeting. At the
meeting, I asked my friends to pray that I find an effective
way to speak to others about these things I had been
learning about Bible prophecies. Then later, in my
conversation with Paul, who does not attend our church or
that Bible study, he expressed his hope that I be able to
share my ideas with others. It was the same thing I had
asked others to pray for only minutes before!</p>

<p>That was not the exciting part. As I expressed my hope
that Catholics and Protestants could find more common
ground, Paul agreed. He said that we should not fight each
other over less important side issues. Then he said, “The
important thing is that we love the Lord our God with all
our heart and mind and our neighbors as our selves.” What
passage had we been studying in our Bible study?</p>

<h4>Jesus replied:</h4>

<h5>“ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart</h5>

<h5>and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</h5>

<h5>This is the first and greatest commandment.</h5>

<h4>And the second is like it:</h4>

<h5>‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</h5>

<h4>All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two</h4>

<h4>commandments.”</h4>

<h6>- Matthew 22:37-40</h6>

<p>Whenever I have been studying a Bible passage one week
and a pastor or speaker in Sunday service cites the same
passage during a sermon or prayer, I know that God is with
us. When that happens, I know that the Holy Spirit has
spoken to both of us and we both are listening. I know that
in that moment, the church is one body. This has happened
scores of times in my life. That it happened concerning my
tentative acceptance that the Roman Catholic Church is on
solid ground for believing and teaching these doctrines
about Mary convinces me that God is working in His church
to bring unity. The Apostle Paul said, 
<em>“Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.”</em> 
(1 Corinthians 13:6)</p>

<p>I rejoice in this truth.</p>

<ul>
<li>6th Era: <strong>1200–1440 AD.</strong></li>
<li>6th Plague: <strong>Boils</strong></li>
<li>6th Commandment: <strong>“You shall not murder.” (20:13)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Christian murdered Christian with great ferocity during
this era. It began with the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD, in
which Catholic Crusaders sacked Orthodox Constantinople
and just got worse. Later, Lollards like John Wycliffe,
Waldensians, and other dissenters or sectarians were
persecuted mercilessly by the church. To Noah, God
commanded:</p>

<h4>“Whoever sheds human blood,</h4>

<h5>by humans shall their blood be shed;</h5>

<h4>for in the image of God</h4>

<h5>has God made mankind.</h5>

<h6>Genesis 9:6, NIV</h6>

<p>And so God kept his promise, without subtlety or
metaphor. From hand to hand and man to man, the Black
Plague spread. This was the dead church of Revelation. The
unmistakeable sign of the plague was the black boils that
swelled under armpits or near the groin.</p>

<p>Moses warned us. We didn’t listen. No worse disease has
yet afflicted this planet. When God pours out the final bowl
judgments, I fear that record will be broken. Remember,
God’s judgments are like fractals. The Black Plague was
God’s judgment on His beloved church. The next instance
of Moses’ clock will commence His judgement upon our
rebellious world.</p>

<ul>
<li>7th Era: <strong>1440–1680 AD.</strong></li>
<li>7th Plague: <strong>Thunder &amp; Hail</strong></li>
<li>7th Commandment: <strong>“You shall not commit adultery.”</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we hear thunder. Most of the thunder in Exodus is
found in the account of the plague of hail. I would call that
the equivalent of setting the words in boldface, italic and
underline and drawing a big red star in the margin.</p>

<p>For actual hailstorms, in 1360 AD (just before the start of
this era), during the Hundred Years War, England lost 1,000
soldiers during a terrible hailstorm at Chartres, while the
French wisely remained indoors. That is not the storm this
prophecy has in mind.</p>

<p>Job 36 twice mentions thunder and twice lightning. In
the chapter “The Second Half” we saw that this chapter of
Job corresponds to the period 1566-1685 AD, a good match
for the second half of this era. From William Gilbert’s
coining of the word “electricity” to the thunder of cannon
in the wars of the General Crisis, this was the stormiest
period in world history prior to the 20th century. It was the
deadliest civil war within Christendom in all its history.</p>

<p>What prompted the storms of war? A great divorce. The
commandment is against adultery, and adultery is God’s
analogy for unfaithfulness to Him. Just as the result of
marital adultery is often divorce, so the result of religious
adultery is schism. The Protestant Reformation was the
response of people who longed to purify the church of
adulterous practices – the mixture of Christianity with
other religions or false beliefs. They saw religious adultery
and filed for divorce.</p>

<p>This era was the turning point in the church’s mission of
reaching the world with the gospel. If it didn't declare a
gospel that can save, then the entire missionary movement
that followed it would have been a colossal waste of time,
treasure and lives. The five thunder verses in Moses’
account of this plague correctly marked the most important
turning point in the history of the church.</p>

<p>How is it that the truth won out after this season? On
Solomon’s sundial, the time immediately following this era
was “a time to listen”, the time of the Pietism movement
and the Great Awakening. The church’s pride had for a long
time rendered it deaf. What made the church suddenly able
to listen?</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">

<ul>
<li>8th Era: <strong>1680–1920 AD.</strong></li>
<li>8th Plague: <strong>Locusts</strong></li>
<li>8th Commandment: <strong>“You shall not steal.” (20:15)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The first French Empire reached its greatest extent in
1680 AD of 3.9 million square miles. Spain reached its
zenith in 1790 AD at 5.3 million square miles. The British
Empire maxed out in 1920 AD at 13.7 million square miles,
one quarter of the Earth. These three empires exemplify
the European Colonial period and conveniently encompass
this season of world history.</p>

<p>In the Bible, locusts are used to symbolize invading
armies which consume everything in their path, leaving
behind no food for the poor. This tick on Moses’ clock is
not hard to grasp. The colonial empires plundered the
earth. They violated God’s command, “You shall not steal”,
on a scale unequaled in history. Within a few decades of the
close of this era, they all lost their empires.</p>

<p>God upholds his law against theft.</p>

<p>God also upholds all his other laws. Those nations that
were plundered? God swore that He would destroy all the
nations. The same colonial empires that stored up God’s
vengeance against themselves were also his agents to crush
forms of wickedness such as slavery to the ends of the
earth.</p>

</ul>

<h4>“You shall not give false testimony</h4>

<h4>against your neighbor.”</h4>

<h4>- Exodus 20:16</h4>

<p>We reach our own time. With a plague of darkness
standing opposite the command to not lie, the conclusion is
inescapable. Deprived of truth, people will walk in
darkness. Science will cave to political pressures in the
West just as in Communist countries and Germany before.</p>

<p><em>
All this was inspired by the principle – which is quite true within
itself – that in **the big lie** there is always a certain force of credibility;
because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily
corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than
consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of
their minds they more readily fall victims to **the big lie** than the
small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters
but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. <br/>
- Adolph Hitler, Mein Kampf, 1925 (trans. by James Murphy)
</em></p>

<p>True theories will be suppressed, stifling medical
research, energy production, education and every other
field of endeavor. True Christian doctrine will be displaced
by heresies or suppressed by persecution. The possibility of
elaborate, digital “deep fakes” will render suspect all
electronic records. This will cause the justice system to
collapse into ineffectiveness or submit to tyranny, if the
state’s slanderous 1984-style fakes are taken at face value.</p>

<p>These are the <em>“days of darkness”</em> Solomon warned us to
remember, <em>“for there will be many.”</em> (Ecclesiastes 11:8)</p>

<ul>
<li>10th Era: <strong>2160–? AD.</strong></li>
<li>10th Plague: <strong>Death of the Firstborn</strong></li>
<li>10th Commandment: <strong>Do not Covet</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house.</h4>

<h4>You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife,</h4>

<h4>or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey,</h4>

<h4>or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”</h4>

<h6>- Exodus 20:17</h6>

<p>Part of this final installment of Moses’ clock is clear and
part murky. The clear part is the good news. The firstborn
over all creation has already died, and will live
forevermore! With the final stroke of this clock, Jesus will
return. If the doorpost of our heart is marked with his
blood, the angel of death will pass over. We will enter the
new Jerusalem and enjoy the Great Supper of God.</p>

<p>What of the command not to covet? In Romans 7, Paul
singles out coveting from among all the commandments as
the one to look out for. If you long for Heaven, your
treasures are there. If you crave the riches and pleasures of
the earth, your treasures are here.</p>

<p>Out of covetousness, all the other evils spring. In this era,
people’s heart choice will at last be revealed. People have
always been covetous, but should a glimmer of God’s power
send people scurrying, only one deceit will give people the
cover to persist in their madness: the promise of eternal life
apart from God. Whether science truly perfects this or
merely approximates it by extending life to a millennium is
immaterial. If people think they can hold onto their
immoral way forever, their choice will be free. No more will
the fear of death give them pause and their true regard for
God will show. Then the end will come.</p>

<h2>You can’t Steal Job’s Thunder</h2>

<p>Let’s augment the previous, detailed analysis of Job.
Words like thunder, thunderings, and thunderbolt occur
ten times. Seven refer to God’s voice or personal exercise of
power ( Job 26:14; 36:29,33; 37:2,4,5 and 40:9). Two refer to
thunder as a natural phenomena (28:26 and 38:25). One
refers to the sound of men at war (39:25). The first group
therefore represents what the “seven thunders” spoke to
Job. Let’s look at the three “minor” ones first, because they
are not insignificant.</p>

<p>Unlike Moses’ Plague clock, which required extra
analysis, we already know the timescales for every chapter
in Job. So what’s with Job 28:26? That chapter is Job’s hymn
to wisdom, a special song. The time period is 614-733 AD.</p>

<h4>When he established the force of the wind</h4>

<h5>and measured out the waters,</h5>

<h4>when he made a decree for the rain</h4>

<h5>and a path for the <strong>thunderstorm</strong>,</h5>

<h4>then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;</h4>

<h5>he confirmed it and tested it.</h5>

<h6>- Job 28:25-27, NIV</h6>

<p>We already associated this chapter of Job with the Islamic
conquests. This era was the intellectual low point for
Christian civilization, early in the Dark Ages. This declares
that God measured out the force of the storm precisely. Any
more force, and the church would shatter. The punchline
after the above verse is:</p>

<h4>And he said to the human race,</h4>

<h5>“The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,</h5>

<h5>and to shun evil is understanding.”</h5>

<h6>- Job 28:28, NIV</h6>

<p>To teach the church the fear of the Lord, he subjected it
to the thunderstorm of Islamic invasions. It worked. The
church learned to trust God’s wisdom, not its own.</p>

<p>Next up is chapter 38, which by the forty-two generation
scheme, occurs in the period 1804-1923 AD:</p>

<h4>What is the way to the place</h4>

<h5>where the <strong>lightning</strong> is dispersed,</h5>

<h4>or the place where the east winds</h4>

<h5>are scattered over the earth?</h5>

<h4>Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain,</h4>

<h5>and a path for the <strong>thunderstorm</strong>,</h5>

<h4>to water a land where no one lives,</h4>

<h5>an uninhabited desert,</h5>

<h4>to satisfy a desolate wasteland</h4>

<h5>and make it sprout with grass?</h5>

<h6>- Job 38:24-27, NIV</h6>

<p>Looks like God is the one who “cuts a path” for
thunderstorms. This thunderstorm defeated Napoleon’s
army. Its path was cut using ash from a volcano on the far
side of the world, as stated in “Father Time”.</p>

<p>This era also saw the development of electric power and
telecommunications. Now it was humans who were
imitating their creator, learning to cut their own paths for
thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>The third use of thunder that does not stand for God’s
voice belongs to a time close to the present. By the scheme
in Job, chapter 39 falls during 1923-2042 AD. We need the
ESV, because the NIV does not render the word as
“thunder”. This is part of God’s praise of the horse:</p>

<h4>With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground;</h4>

<h5>he cannot stand still at the sound of the <strong>trumpet</strong>.</h5>

<h4>When the <strong>trumpet</strong> sounds, he says ‘Aha!’</h4>

<h4>He smells the <strong>battle</strong> from afar,</h4>

<h5>the <strong>thunder</strong> of the captains, and the shouting.</h5>

<h6>- Job 39:24-25, ESV</h6>

<p>WW II is a good event to associate with war horses and
thunder. Hitler’s generals called their military tactics
blitzkrieg, or “lightning war”. But these verses match an
event more terrifying:</p>

<p><em>
The fifth angel sounded his **trumpet**, and I saw a star that had fallen
from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of
the Abyss… <br/>
The locusts looked like **horses** prepared for battle. On their heads
they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled
human faces. Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were
like lions’ teeth. They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and
the sound of their wings was like the **thundering of many horses**
and chariots rushing into **battle**. They had tails with stingers, like
scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for
five months. They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss,
whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is,
**Destroyer**). <br/>
- Revelation 9:1,7-11, NIV
</em></p>

<p>We will not attempt to comprehend what Revelation 9
means, merely recognize that the imagery in Job 39, with
trumpet blaring and thundering horses, matches it closely.
This tells us that there is wisdom about the use of thunder
in Revelation to be obtained by studying Job. It may have
been sealed (encoded), but it was not omitted.</p>

<p>From the above uses of thunder, we see man’s foolish
delight in plunging into war. The armies of Mohammed,
Napoleon and Hitler boldly took the field, but the path for
their thunder was established and constrained by God.
Those storms could cause no more damage than He
allowed. When God speaks on His own behalf, however,
there is no limit to what His thunder can do.</p>

<p>So Revelation in two verses (10:3-4, which have three
thunder references) tells us of the existence of the seven
thunders. In like fashion Job in two verses speaks of how
God cuts a path for the thunder. The angel in Revelation is
standing with one foot on land and the other in the sea.
Job’s thunder reference in chapter 28 appears to refer to a
storm over water, while the reference in chapter 38 is about
a storm over land. Both Revelation and Job have exactly
one verse that speaks not of God’s thunder but of man’s
Satanically inspired thunder of war with horses charging
and trumpets blaring. Whatever message the seven
thunders spoke to John, it must have something to do with
the seven remaining thunder verses in Job.</p>

<p>What did the seven thunders tell Job? First recognize that
one thunder verse was spoken by Job, five by Elihu, and
one by God speaking from the whirlwind. The second thing
to note is the crescendo: one thunder in chapter 26, two in
chapter 36, three in chapter 37, and back to one in chapter
40.</p>

<p>The increase in lightning is similar: once in chapter 28,
twice in chapter 36, and four times in chapter 37, dropping
off to once in chapter 38. (In some translations, the last
usage is light, not lightning.) The difference is that the final
burst of light – secular science – occurs in chapter 38, but
the final burst of sound – spiritual knowledge – occurs in
chapter 40, the era about to begin. This suggests that
humanity’s knowledge of nature has outpaced its
knowledge of God, leading to heresy, apostasy and atheism.</p>

<p>One interesting aside. The Hebrew for Job 28:26 literally
means “and way for perception of sounds”. While it can
mean that God makes a path for the thunder or
thunderstorm, it can also mean that God has made his
thunder visible. Lightning is visible sound. Thus all our
engineering marvels are God’s commands made visible.</p>

<p>Of the three speakers, Job stands for God the Son as
suffering servant. Elihu speaks for the Holy Spirit and the
voice from the whirlwind comes from God the Father. If
any doubt this, consider the opening words of chapter 26,
corresponding to 376-495 AD:</p>

<h4>“How you have helped the powerless!</h4>

<h4>How you have saved the arm that is feeble!</h4>

<h4>What advice you have offered to one without wisdom!</h4>

<h4>And what great insight you have displayed!</h4>

<h4>Who has helped you utter these words?</h4>

<h4>And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?</h4>

<h6>- Job 26:2-4</h6>

<p>Verse two speaks of the Father’s power to save, which He
did in this period by giving the Roman Empire to the
church to rule. The wisdom of verse three is the voice of
the Spirit. The words uttered from the mouth of verse four
are the words of Christ, who is the Word. This chapter is
devoted to the Trinitarian delegation of the work of
administering justice in the world.</p>

<h4>“The dead are in deep anguish,</h4>

<h5>those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</h5>

<h4>The realm of the dead is naked before God;</h4>

<h5><strong>Destruction</strong> lies uncovered.</h5>

<h6>- Job 26:5-6</h6>

<p>“Destruction” appears in this chapter, just as it did in
Revelation 9. Surely the resurrection, part of God’s plan of
justice, is addressed by the Seven Thunders. Later on in the
chapter, we see a more concrete connection to Revelation:</p>

<h4>By his power he churned up the sea;</h4>

<h4>by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.</h4>

<h4>By his breath the skies became fair;</h4>

<h4><strong>his hand pierced the gliding serpent</strong>.</h4>

<h4>And these are but the outer fringe of his works;</h4>

<h4>how faint the whisper we hear of him!</h4>

<h4>Who then can understand the thunder of his power?”</h4>

<h4>- Job 26:12-14</h4>

<p>Commentators speculate whom Rahab indicates. It could
be Egypt, Egypt’s fallen angel, an additional sea monster, or
a synonym for Leviathan indicating its pride. The book
summons both Rahab and Leviathan, both are described as
sea creatures and both are pierced by the hand of God and
subdued. This makes it likely that this passage refers to God
vanquishing an evil, beastly empire. All through his
speeches, Job cries out for a savior to rescue him from his
personal crises. This chapter enlarges the scope of his
supplication. Now he turns to God as the one who will
rescue the whole world from the collective forces of large
scale evil. Thus verse 14 equates God’s voice of thunder
with the overthrow of evil. Job says we can’t understand
how it will be accomplished – and John’s obedient silence
keeps it that way.</p>

<p>Elihu takes up thunder in chapter 36 with two
references. This chapter addresses 1566-1685 AD. Five of
the thunders in Exodus pointed to this era by the plague of
hail and fire. Combining Exodus and Job, seven references
to thunder point to this period, the time of the General
Crisis and the breaking of the second seal when the fiery
red horse marched out, ridden by one with a large sword:</p>

<h4>But if they do not listen,</h4>

<h5>they will perish by the <strong>sword</strong></h5>

<h6>and die without knowledge.</h6>

<h6>- Job 36:12, NIV</h6>

<p>Christian Huygens invented the pendulum clock in 1656
AD. Even with a more accurate timepiece, Elihu’s words
still apply to us:</p>

<h4>How great is God—beyond our understanding!</h4>

<h4><strong>The number of his years is past finding out</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Job 36:26</h6>

<p>This chapter thus speaks of the mystery of God’s timing
and the sword, connecting it to Revelation. At the end of
the chapter, we hear the thunder.</p>

<h4>Can anyone understand how the clouds spread out</h4>

<h4>or how the <strong>thunder</strong> roars from God's pavilion?</h4>

<h4>See how He spreads His <strong>lightning</strong> around Him</h4>

<h4>and covers the depths of the sea.</h4>

<h4>For He judges the nations with these;</h4>

<h4>He gives food in abundance.</h4>

<h4>He covers His hands with <strong>lightning</strong></h4>

<h4>and commands it to hit its mark.</h4>

<h4>The <strong>thunder</strong> declares His presence;</h4>

<h4>the cattle also, the approaching storm.</h4>

<h6>- Job 36:29-33, HCSB</h6>

<p>“The Second Half” tied this to the wars of that period
and the advances in science. Textually, this announces to
Job that God is drawing near, so you better listen. By
Solomon’s reckoning, the next era would be “a time to
listen”. Indeed, God was telling the warring factions of the
church to shut up because he had something to say. Thus
Solomon, Moses and Job were in agreement.</p>

<p>For all this talk of thunder, how did God get people to
listen? The key was causing people’s closed ears to open:</p>

<h4>He <strong>opens their ears</strong> to instruction...</h4>

<h6>- Job 36:10, ESV</h6>

<p>and</p>

<h4>He delivers the afflicted by their affliction</h4>

<h4>and <strong>opens their ear</strong> by adversity.</h4>

<h6>- Job 36:15, ESV</h6>

<p>So the thunder shouted twice, but even that would have
been useless if God had not opened people’s ears through
suffering. That was how He reached me all those years ago,
when I sat deaf in a doctor’s waiting room. It was not the
healing miracle that opened my spiritual ears to hear His
word, it was the disease.</p>

<p>This era saw the beginning of the first time in which God
“judges the nations” on a worldwide scale. (In Noah’s day,
nations had not yet formed.) This was done at the hands of
the European colonial empires which destroyed every
nation. The seven thunders are telling us that it will happen
again, near the end.</p>

<p>If this era’s thunder was to tell people to shut up, the
next era’s thunder was to deliver the message. Chapter 37
of Job, covering 1685-1804 AD, mentions thunder three
times. It is the focal point of the thunders and the central
chapter of Job.</p>

<h4>At this also my heart trembles</h4>

<h5>and leaps out of its place.</h5>

<h4>Keep listening to the <strong>thunder</strong> of his voice</h4>

<h5>and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.</h5>

<h4>Under the whole heaven he lets it go,</h4>

<h5>and his <strong>lightning</strong> to the corners of the earth.</h5>

<h4>After it his voice roars;</h4>

<h5>he <strong>thunders</strong> with his majestic voice,</h5>

<h4>and he does not restrain the <strong>lightnings</strong></h4>

<h5>when his voice is heard.</h5>

<h4>God <strong>thunders</strong> wondrously with his voice;</h4>

<h5>he does great things that we cannot comprehend.</h5>

<h6>- Job 37:1-5, ESV</h6>

<p>and</p>

<h4>He loads the thick cloud with moisture;</h4>

<h4>the clouds scatter his <strong>lightning</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Job 37:11, ESV</h6>

<p>and</p>

<h4>Do you know how God lays his command upon them</h4>

<h4>and causes the <strong>lightning</strong> of his cloud to shine?</h4>

<h5>- Job 37:15, ESV</h5>

<p>In this time, God revealed the wondrous laws of the
natural world as never before. Thunder is about speaking
and hearing, about logic, ideas and thinking. Lightning is
about seeing, making and doing. God’s marvels had entered
the physical realm before, but now “he does not restrain”.
With the opening of the second seal on the scroll, God
removed the restraints he had placed upon human
knowledge. So what did the seven thunders have to say to
John? Will those intellectual restraints be restored as
humanity goes senile? Or will God give us more
technological rope by which we may hang ourselves?</p>

<p>The lightning was the true inspiration for the
Enlightenment, as well as the Pietism Movement and Great
Awakening. These paved the way for God’s miraculous
restructuring of the political and economic world, starting
with the abolition movement and establishment of
democracies like America.</p>

<p>Yet in this era, what do we see?</p>

<h4>Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;</h4>

<h5>God comes in awesome majesty.</h5>

<h4>The Almighty is beyond our reach</h4>

<h5>and exalted in power;</h5>

<h4>in his justice and great righteousness,</h4>

<h5>he does not oppress.</h5>

<h6>- Job 37:22-23, NIV</h6>

<p>We see God on the way, but not yet here. For all the
spectacle of the thunder and the lightning, God is not yet
here. Whatever the seven thunders had to say, they were
not the last word. As impressive and detailed as the
message might have been, after John heard it, there was
more for him to hear, more prophecies to write down, and
the end was not yet come.</p>

<p>This brings us to the seventh thunder in Job, spoken by
God in chapter 40, corresponding to 2042-2161 AD.</p>

<h4>Do you have an arm like God’s,</h4>

<h5>and can your voice <strong>thunder</strong> like his?</h5>

<h4>Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor,</h4>

<h5>and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.</h5>

<h4>Unleash the fury of your wrath,</h4>

<h5>look at all who are proud and bring them low,</h5>

<h4>look at all who are proud and humble them,</h4>

<h5>crush the wicked where they stand.</h5>

<h6>- Job 40:9-12, NIV</h6>

<p>From this final word about thunder in Job, we see again a
connection to God’s wrath in judgment. This is followed in
Job by the introduction of Behemoth, the beast from the
land. That same beast is introduced in Revelation 13, just a
few chapters after the seven thunders spoke.</p>

<p>Step back and you can see the plan behind this speech in
Job from the seven thunders. The first thundering in
chapter 26 announced the time when the church acquired
Rome and got its first taste of political power. The middle
five struck during the period following the Reformation
when the church rode forth at the head of numerous
colonial empires and spread the gospel to the whole world.
By symmetry, the last, in Job 40, must be when the church
is stripped of political power. That is Solomon’s “time to
hate”, when the fifth seal will be broken and persecution
breaks out, while Behemoth licks its chops.</p>

<h2>And now for Revelation…</h2>

<p>The clustering of thunders as 1-5-1 in Job told us
something. The same can be said for Exodus – it will
establish a key connection to Revelation. Consider that the
giving of the Ten Commandments came after a waiting
period of three days (recalling Jesus in the grave), was
preceded by a trumpet blast and thunder, and followed by
a trumpet blast and thunder. Those two thunders are the
one at the beginning and the one at the end of the time
period. The five thunders in the account of the plagues are
the five in the middle.</p>

<p><strong>First Trumpet (1453 AD)</strong>. What was that plague? It was
the plague of hail and fire (which matches 1440–1680 AD).
Revelation also has a plague of hail and fire:</p>

<h4>The first angel sounded his trumpet, and</h4>

<h4>there came hail and fire mixed with blood,</h4>

<h4>and it was hurled down on the earth.</h4>

<h4>A third of the earth was burned up,</h4>

<h4>a third of the trees were burned up,</h4>

<h4>and all the green grass was burned up.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 8:7, NIV</h6>

<p>Ellis Skolfield matched this event to the Islamic conquest
of the Middle East, which captured a third of the church’s
territory, destroyed a third of the churches (the trees), and
caused most people (the grass) to die spiritually, by forced
conversion to Islam. I formerly considered that a possible
interpretation, but could not be certain. Now I am. The
final overthrow of Constantinople and mass enslavement of
Eastern European Christians by the Turks occurs at the
very beginning of the era corresponding to the plague of
hail. Furthermore, the curse was hurled down upon the
earth, which represents a corrupt church, just like the
beast of the earth.</p>

<p><strong>Second Trumpet</strong>. If the first trumpet fits in at the start
of the Exodus’ plague of hail era, the second trumpet may
match the era of the next plague, the locusts:</p>

<h4>The second angel sounded his <strong>trumpet</strong>,</h4>

<h4>and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze,</h4>

<h4>was thrown into the sea.</h4>

<h4>A third of the sea turned into blood,</h4>

<h4>a third of the living creatures in the sea died,</h4>

<h4>and a third of the ships were destroyed.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 8:8-9, NIV</h6>

<p>The General Crisis certainly killed about a third of
Europe, by famine and war, and many other peoples
worldwide. The next era was the height of the colonial
expansion, so the reference to ships and the sea is spot on.
However, this trumpet may only cover the early part of
European expansion, the age of exploration and conquest
of the Americas. The reasoning for this is that the fifth
trumpet directly mentions locusts.
Leviathan rules the sea, meaning the chaotic peoples
outside the church. Thus this trumpet affects unbelievers
the most.</p>

<p><strong>Third Trumpet</strong>. Having matched two trumpets to the
timeline from Exodus, can we match a third?</p>

<h4>The third angel sounded his trumpet,</h4>

<h4>and a great star, blazing like a torch,</h4>

<h4>fell from the sky on a third of the rivers</h4>

<h4>and on the springs of water— the name of</h4>

<h4>the star is Wormwood.</h4>

<h4>A third of the waters turned bitter,</h4>

<h4>and many people died from the waters</h4>

<h4>that had become bitter.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 8:10-11, NIV</h6>

<p>Back in 1986, after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, a
rumor spread that the Russian word for the plant
wormwood was Chernobyl. This identification would mean
that the third trumpet in Revelation was speaking of
radiation poisoning after the explosion of nuclear missiles
“blazing like a torch”. I heard the rumor at the time and
believed it. President Ronald Reagan was also reputed to
have believed it. Many people were terrified that a nuclear
war between the United States and Russia would usher in
the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>That didn’t happen, so people shrugged and moved on. It
turns out that a plant spelled “chornobyl” in Ukrainian is
what we call mugwort, or <em>Artemisia vulgaris</em>. It is not
wormwood. Wormwood is <em>Artemisia absinthium</em>. If you look
at pictures of each, you can see a resemblance, but they are
not difficult to distinguish.</p>

<p>So was an easily panicked world wrong to make the
association? Or wrong to later abandon it? These
prophecies are symbolic. The poisoning of waters may
mean unholiness, false doctrine or some other idea, but it
is unlikely to mean the literal poisoning of water. Yet God
makes parables even out of our misunderstandings.
Perhaps God caused that chance similarity of two plants
and a spelling close to the name of a Soviet reactor to spark
enough interest to warn the world.</p>

<p>Other parts of the prophecy are clear. The “great star” is
the symbol of the Soviet Union, a red star, and is still
featured prominently on the flag of China. At its peak, the
Communist Bloc ruled over a third of the world’s
population, just as the verses say. It made life bitter for its
subjects and caused many people to die, such as during the
Holodomor in the Ukraine (site of Chernobyl), the Great
Famine in China, and other atrocities. So the rumor
correctly pointed people to the Soviet Union as a party to
the third trumpet, but incorrectly associated it with a
nuclear war. The outcome was that people’s eyes are
blinded to the truth even more.</p>

<p>This third trumpet’s words do not match a plague in
Exodus, though the Soviet Union did act like a locust,
consuming everything in its path. At least seventy million
people died from famines caused by Russia, China, North
Korea and the others.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth Trumpet</strong>. This trumpet is the next to be blown.</p>

<h4>The fourth angel sounded his trumpet,</h4>

<h4>and a third of the sun was struck,</h4>

<h4>a third of the moon,</h4>

<h4>and a third of the stars, so that</h4>

<h4>a third of them turned dark.</h4>

<h4>A third of the day was without light,</h4>

<h4>and also a third of the night.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 8:12, NIV</h6>

<p>The next plague to match is the plague of darkness, and
this trumpet is a good match for that. Ellis Skolfield
considered the light of the sun, moon and stars to be the
influence of Christianity upon the world. The great
persecution during Solomon’s “time to hate” will kill many,
cause others to abandon the faith, and still more to go into
hiding. The influence of the church will grow dim and evil
and madness will multiply rapidly. Jesus said we should let
our light shine before men. Most will not.</p>

<p>The fourth trumpet will blow near the time when the
fifth seal on the scroll is broken, later in this century. As for
the remaining trumpets, I will leave their timing to God –
though the fifth has me puzzled.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth Trumpet</strong>. The first trumpet matched the plague of
hail and fire, allowing us to correlate it with Moses’ Plague
clock. The fifth trumpet says this, which messes with the
timeline:</p>

<p>And out of the smoke <strong>locusts</strong> came down on the earth and were
given power like that of scorpions of the earth. (Revelation 9:3)</p>

<p>If this trumpet matches the plague of locusts in Exodus,
then it sounded before the third trumpet! There is a
transition between the fourth and fifth trumpet blasts
which could indicate a jump in the timeline:</p>

<h4>As I watched, I heard an eagle that was</h4>

<h4>flying in midair call out in a loud voice:</h4>

<h5>“Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants</h5>

<h5>of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts</h5>

<h5>about to be sounded by the other three angels!”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 8:13, NIV</h6>

<p>The fifth trumpet heralds the first of the three woes.
What details in Revelation 9 might match the era in
question? First is this curious statement:</p>

<h4>The locusts looked like horses prepared</h4>

<h4>for battle. On their heads they wore something</h4>

<h4>like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled</h4>

<h4>human faces. Their hair was like women’s hair, and</h4>

<h4>their teeth were like lions’ teeth.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 9:7-8</h6>

<p>From our analysis of Job, we previously identified Queen
Victoria as the lioness. This verse may refer to Christian
Queens – who certainly wore crowns of gold. The three
major queens of the period were Catherine the Great of
Russia, Maria Theresa of the Holy Roman Empire, and
Victoria of England. From the start of the reign of Maria
Theresa as empress (1745 AD) to the end of the reign of
Victoria (1901 AD) was 156 years. If we instead sum the
lengths of their reigns and include lesser queens, we have
Catherine I (2 yrs), Anna (10.5 yrs), Elizabeth (20 yrs),
Catherine II (34.5 yrs) – all of Russia, Maria Theresa (20 yrs)
of Austria, Victoria (64 yrs), for a cumulative reign of 151
years and several months. Compare this to the given time
period of their influence:</p>

<p>They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they
had power to torment people for five months. (Revelation 9:10)</p>

<p>According to Ellis Skolfield, a year has 365 days, and in
prophecy each of those days may stand for a year. So five
months is 365*(5/12) = 152 years. </p>

<p>(NOTE: I later found a more detailed way to look at this prophecy,
as given in the articles <a href="./153-and-the-fifth-trumpet.md">153 and the Fifth Trumpet</a> 
and <a href="./industrial-revolution.html">The Industrial Revolution</a>. 
Instead of 152 years, the time period is 153 years, which spans the entire period of the industrial revolution.)</p>

<p>Thus we match the feminine aspect of the reign and the length of time. 
What else compares?</p>

<h4>They were told not to harm the</h4>

<h4>grass of the earth or any plant or tree,</h4>

<h4>but only those people who did not have</h4>

<h4>the seal of God on their foreheads. They were</h4>

<h4>not allowed to kill them but only to torture</h4>

<h4>them for five months. And the agony they</h4>

<h4>suffered was like that of the sting of a</h4>

<h4>scorpion when it strikes.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 9:4-5</h6>

<p>The grass is Christians (anyone who has the seal of God
on their forehead) and the tree is churches, so these locusts
were given the power only to attack non-Christians and
bring destruction:</p>

<p>They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in
Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).
(Revelation 9:11)</p>

<p>This fits the prophecy that God would destroy all the
nations while advancing the gospel. It would not make
sense for this fifth trumpet to follow the fourth trumpet,
because that calamity causes the church to lose political
influence on a horrendous scale. It seems incongruous for
the church to all of a sudden recover its authority, though I
welcome that if the timeline given here is incorrect.</p>

<p>Furthermore, recall Job 3, where Job makes reference to
the seven days of creation, but swaps the order of the
fourth and fifth days. The fourth day of creation is when
the sun, moon and stars were created. The fourth trumpet
is a judgment which strikes the sun, moon and stars. Thus
this reversal of the order of the fourth and fifth trumpets is
foreshadowed by Job.</p>

<p>(Note: The fifth trumpet in 9:1 refers to 
<em>“a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth”.</em> 
If this is the same as <em>“a great star, blazing like a torch, [that]</em> 
<em>fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water”</em> 
for the third trumpet in 8:10, the grammar would make it seem that the
fifth trumpet must follow the third. That invalidates one of
the two historical matches. A possible solution for this is
that secular ideas from the Enlightenment poisoned the
waters of philosophy. Those poisonous ideas preceded the
British Empire’s heyday, but grew into the doctrines of
communism, fascism, evolution, racism, and other
ideologies that proved deadly after the death of Victoria.)</p>

<p>Concerning the sixth trumpet: can we decide whether it
follows the fourth trumpet or precedes it? The sixth
trumpet – the second woe – results in the killing of a third of
mankind. It makes sense if this follows the fourth trumpet,
because the church’s loss of influence paves the way for
death on a large scale.</p>

<p>One verse from the fifth trumpet is our segue back to
talking about thunder:</p>

<h4>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron,</h4>

<h4>and the sound of their wings was like the</h4>

<h4><strong>thundering</strong> of many horses and chariots</h4>

<h4>rushing into battle.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 9:9, NIV</h6>

<p>Just like Job had one thunder verse that was about the
men at war (“the thunder of the captains”) riding horses –
not the thunder of God’s voice – so the above verse refers to
warring empires with horses and chariots. The time
periods of each do not match but are adjacent, with Job
referring to the twentieth century. However the British
Empire was at the center of both references to thunder.
Let’s see if the seven main references to God’s thunder in
Revelation have anything in common.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation’s Thunder</strong>. Clues from Exodus established
when the first, second, third and fifth trumpets of
Revelation were blown and when to expect the fourth, and
using our previous identification of when the first four seals
on the scroll were opened, what can we tell about the seven
thunders in Revelation? They are found in these passages:</p>

<p><strong>4:5, 6:1, 8:5, 11:19, 14:2, 16:18, 19:6</strong></p>

<p>Revelation skips around. It gives a chronological series of
prophecies, stops, jumps back, then commences a new
series. Some jumps are clearly labeled. Because thunder
verses are scattered throughout the whole of Revelation, it
is unlikely that they are given in chronological order. We
shall need other reference points to deduce their order.</p>

<p>Can we use Exodus to help us with the order? Exodus
had ten plagues, but Revelation has many more. Even so,
most plagues in Exodus match one in Revelation.</p>

<p><img class="wide" src="images/exodus-and-revelation-plagues.png" alt="Table comparing plagues of Exodus to Revelation" /></p>

<p>Only the third plague, of gnats, has no analog. In Exodus
8:16-17, it says that Moses struck the dust of the earth and it
turned into gnats. The only possible connection in
Revelation is this passage that mentions dust:</p>

<h4>When they see the smoke of her burning,</h4>

<h4>they will exclaim,</h4>

<h5>‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’</h5>

<h4>They will throw <strong>dust</strong> on their heads, and with</h4>

<h4>weeping and mourning cry out:</h4>

<h5>“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all</h5>

<h5>who had ships on the sea became rich</h5>

<h5>through her wealth! In one hour she has been</h5>

<h5>brought to ruin!’ ”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 18:18-19</h6>

<p>This dust is a sign of mourning after a judgment, not a
vector of judgment.
From the preceding table, it is evident that the order of
plagues in Exodus and their order in Revelation are
uncorrelated. Thus if the chronological sequence of plagues
in Revelation follows that in Exodus it would mean that the
events in Revelation are not even close to being ordered.</p>

<p>What about how we matched Matthew and the Psalms
with the twenty-eight times in Ecclesiastes? After hours of
tedious analysis, I was able to deduce several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revelation has many sevens, but only four chronological sequences: churches, seals, trumpets and bowls</li>
<li>Four times seven is twenty-eight, matching Ecclesiastes</li>
<li>Solomon’s twenty-eight times all appear in Revelation</li>
<li>No pattern may be discerned in the order of the times</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that three clocks in Ecclesiastes, two in the Psalms
(including one in “Appendix D: To Number our Psalms”),
one each in Matthew, Proverbs and Song of Songs track the
twenty-eight times, this is evidence that the time sequence
of events in Revelation has been intentionally altered. More
clues to unraveling the true sequence are likely hidden in
the Bible. It will take someone wiser than I to spot them.</p>

<p>If we can’t deduce a chronological order, can we derive a
useful conceptual order? Yes, and it tells us something
profound. The places where the thunder passages appear
have a structure. They usually speak about a judgment and
they always contain another element. From this we cannot
infer what judgments the seven thunders announce, but we
can infer what goes with them.</p>

<p><strong>First thunder</strong> (Revelation 4:5). This thunder comes from the throne
and is not associated with a particular judgment. It is
followed by verse 8, where the four living creatures say,
<em>“Holy, holy, holy…”</em> and by verse 11, where the twenty-four
elders praise the worthiness of God. This comes before the
first seal is opened and before the trumpet and bowl
judgments.</p>

<p><strong>Second thunder</strong> (Revelation 6:1-2). This happens when the first seal
is opened. It follows chapter 5, in which the four living
creatures, elders, many angels and then all creatures speak
of the worthiness of the Lamb. It precedes chapter 7 (which
comes after the sixth seal is opened), in which a multitude,
then angels shout their praise.</p>

<p><strong>Third thunder</strong> (Revelation 8:1-5). This follows the opening of the
seventh seal, a half hour of silence, the distribution of the
seven trumpets, and the offering of prayers by God’s
people. It precedes the blowing of the first trumpet.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth thunder</strong> (Revelation 11:19). This follows the sounding of the
seventh trumpet and the call of loud voices saying, 
<em>“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord</em>
<em>and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”</em> They
are joined by the twenty-four elders. Then the temple in
heaven is opened, producing the thunder.</p>

<p><strong>Fifth thunder</strong> (Revelation 14:2). The lamb assembles the 144,000,
the orchestra of harps sounds the tune, 
<em>“And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures</em>
<em>and the elders. <strong>No one could learn the song</strong> except the</em>
<em>144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.”</em> This is
followed by six angels and the Son of Man harvesting the
earth. That is followed by the singing of the song of Moses
and the Lamb.</p>

<p><strong>Sixth thunder</strong> (Revelation 16:18). This follows the pouring of the
seventh bowl and is accompanied by a terrible plague of
hail, possibly the one foreshadowed in Job 38:22-23. It
precedes a voice of praise from the throne, followed by a
great multitude shouting, “Hallelujah! For our Lord God
Almighty reigns… For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and
his bride has made herself ready.”</p>

<p><strong>Seventh thunder</strong> (Revelation 19:6). A multitude and the elders
alternate offering praise. This follows the previous
chapter’s woes, which include this devastating
pronouncement: <em>“The light of a lamp will never shine in you again.</em>
<em>The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again…”</em> (Revelation 18:23)</p>

<p>This final thunder occurs in the midst of a celebration:</p>

<h4>“Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory!</h4>

<h4>For the wedding of the Lamb has come,</h4>

<h5>and his bride has made herself ready.</h5>

<h4>Fine linen, bright and clean,</h4>

<h5>was given her to wear...”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 19:7-8a</h6>

<p>It comes just before the Word of God marches out on his
white horse to the final battle.</p>

<h2>A Harvest of Thunder</h2>

<p>Focusing on how the seven thunders are situated within
their context revealed a pattern that was not previously
apparent. Revelation is structured according to the
sevenfold harvest pattern, punctuated by the thunder
passages. Then marvelously, once you see the harvest
pattern, Solomon’s times are unveiled! Here is the proof.</p>

<p>(1) The <em>first thunder</em> emphasizes “Holy, holy, holy”. Jesus
was set apart as holy and consecrated, which was his
<strong>preparation</strong>.</p>

<p>What are the first four of Solomon’s times? <em>“A time to be born,</em> 
<em>a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up.”</em>
The preceding chapter 3 warns the church of Sardis, who
has “a reputation of being alive”: 
<em>“Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to <strong>die</strong>, for I have found your deeds</em>
<em>unfinished in the sight of my God.”</em> (Revelation 3:2) To the church of
Philadelphia, the message is upbeat: 
<em>“See, I have placed before you <strong>an open door that no one can shut</strong>.”</em> (Revelation 3:8) 
That is analogous to being planted and firmly established. Then,
to the church of Laodicea, God warns, 
<em>“So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to <strong>spit you out of my mouth</strong>.”</em> (Revelation 3:16) 
If you wanted to describe someone being
uprooted, how much more graphic could you get?</p>

<p>Yet even in judgment, God offers mercy. The Lord
promised dying Sardis that by repenting, they could be
reborn:</p>

<h4>The one who is victorious will, like them,</h4>

<h4>be dressed in white. I will never blot out</h4>

<h4>the name of that person from <strong>the book of life</strong>,</h4>

<h4>but will acknowledge that name before my Father</h4>

<h4>and his angels.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 3:5</h6>

<p>(2) Moving to the <em>second thunder</em>, the emphasis shifts to
the Lamb’s worthiness because he was slain. This was the
<strong>plowing</strong> phase, Christ’s suffering on the cross. Plowing is
also associated with the autumn rains, which soften the
earth for the plow. The analogy to rain is the tears of the
sufferer. Recall that according to Solomon’s Sundial, the
time of weeping was the time when Christ was crucified. In
the chapter preceding the thunder, it is John who weeps:</p>

<h4><strong>I wept and wept</strong> because no one was found</h4>

<h4>who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.</h4>

<h4>Then one of the elders said to me,</h4>

<h5><strong>“Do not weep!</strong> See, the Lion of the</h5>

<h5>tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has</h5>

<h5>triumphed. He is able to open the scroll</h5>

<h5>and its seven seals.”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 5:4-5</h6>

<p>So if John is told to not weep, then he must laugh! The
elders and multitudes around the throne are definitely not
mourning. Since some of them are playing harps (Revelation 5:8), I
assume there must be dancing! Weep and laugh, mourn
and dance are the third quartet of Solomon’s times. These
belong with the next season of Solomon’s times, so they fit
the harvest phase (autumn rains) but are slightly off
according to the sundial.</p>

<p>The times of Solomon’s that this section matches well are
<em>“a time to kill”</em>, because Jesus is the most important person
ever to be killed, and <em>“a time to build”</em>, because God built it
all:</p>

<h4>And they sang a new song, saying:</h4>

<h5>“You are worthy to take the scroll</h5>

<h5>and to open its seals,</h5>

<h5><strong>because you were slain</strong>,</h5>

<h5>and with your blood you purchased for God</h5>

<h5>persons from every tribe and language</h5>

<h5>and people and nation.</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 5:9</h6>

<p>and</p>

<h4>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,</h4>

<h5>to receive glory and honor and power,</h5>

<h4>for <strong>you created all things</strong>,</h4>

<h5><strong>and by your will they were created</strong></h5>

<h6><strong>and have their being</strong>.”</h6>

<h6>- Revelation 4:11, NIV</h6>

<p>(3) The third phase is supposed to be <strong>planting</strong> the seed,
which is speaking the truth of the gospel. Instead, near the
time of the <em>third thunder</em>, we have a half hour of silence
during which time God’s people pray.</p>

<p>In this section, in harmony with Solomon’s times,
weeping and mourning do have a place, but it is not God’s
faithful who are doing it:</p>

<h4>They called to the mountains and the rocks,</h4>

<h5>“Fall on us and hide us from the face</h5>

<h5>of him who sits on the throne and from</h5>

<h5>the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day</h5>

<h5>of their wrath has come, and who can</h5>

<h5>withstand it?”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 6:16-17, NIV</h6>

<p>For God’s people, the time of tears will pass, for in this
section our loving God has given us this great promise:</p>

<h4>For the Lamb at the center of the throne</h4>

<h5>will be their shepherd;</h5>

<h5>‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’</h5>

<h5>‘<strong>And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes</strong>.’”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 7:17</h6>

<p>(4) The fourth phase is <strong>pouring</strong>, a time of suffering and
persecution, which the <em>fourth thunder</em> delivered: 
<em>“Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes</em>
<em>up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.”</em> (Revelation 11:7)</p>

<p>Revelation 11 fitly represents the fourth set of times in
Ecclesiastes 3: gathering and scattering stones, embracing
and refraining. John was asked to measure the temple in
11:1-2, signifying the gathering of stones (cooperation). Then
in 11:13, an earthquake destroys a tenth of the city,
scattering stones. The wicked inhabitants of the earth
refrain from embracing the message of the two witnesses
and kill them, but God embraces his servants with a
miracle:</p>

<h4>But after the three and a half days</h4>

<h4>the breath of life from God entered them,</h4>

<h4>and they stood on their feet, and terror struck</h4>

<h4>those who saw them.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 11:11, NIV</h6>

<p>(5) The fifth phase is <strong>plucking</strong>, in which the Father
miraculously directs human affairs in tangible ways,
disciplining and guiding, just like you guide a fish caught in
a fishhook. The <em>fifth thunder</em> followed the chapter that
described Behemoth and Leviathan, the beasts from the
land and sea. As terrifying as they are, God is able to direct
them according to his plan. Strangely, the miracle cited in
chapter 13 is the healing of one of the beasts!</p>

<p>The fifth group of times in Solomon’s clock is searching
and giving up, keeping and throwing away. The searching is
done by the dragon, who searches for the woman and her
child (Jesus or the church) to kill them (Revelation 12:13-16), but he
gives up his search, a failure. The keeping is God keeping
the woman and child safe, while the throwing away is
something to cheer, the expulsion of Satan from Heaven:</p>

<h4>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:</h4>

<h5>“Now have come the salvation and the power</h5>

<h6>and the kingdom of our God,</h6>

<h6>and the authority of his Messiah.</h6>

<h5>For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,</h5>

<h6>who accuses them before our God day and night,</h6>

<h6>has been <strong>hurled down</strong>.</h6>

<h6>- Revelation 12:10, NIV</h6>

<p>(6) The sixth phase is <strong>producing</strong> the harvest. 
The <em>sixth thunder</em> followed the announcement of the Son of Man and
six angels (a collective seven) harvesting the earth in
chapter 14 and its implementation in terms of the seven
bowl judgments in chapters 15 and 16.</p>

<h4>Then another angel came out of the temple</h4>

<h4>and called in a loud voice to him who was</h4>

<h4>sitting on the cloud,</h4>

<h5>“Take your sickle and reap,</h5>

<h5>because the time to reap has come,</h5>

<h5>for <strong>the harvest of the earth</strong> is ripe.”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 14:15</h6>

<p>The sixth grouping of Solomon’s times begins with 
<em>“a time to tear”</em> and concludes with <em>“a time to speak”</em>. The
wicked people being torn from their world are likened to
grapes, and the tearing is done using a sickle:</p>

<h4>Then another angel came out of the temple</h4>

<h4>and called in a loud voice to him who was</h4>

<h4>sitting on the cloud,</h4>

<h5>“Take your sickle and reap,</h5>

<h5>because the time to reap has come,</h5>

<h5>for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”</h5>

<h4>So he who was seated on the cloud swung</h4>

<h4>his sickle over the earth, and the earth</h4>

<h4>was harvested.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 14:15-16</h6>

<p>Revelation contains a lot of important speeches, but the
voice of first angel of the harvest best captures “a time to
speak”:</p>

<h4>Then I saw another angel flying in midair,</h4>

<h4>and <strong>he had the eternal gospel to proclaim</strong></h4>

<h4>to those who live on the earth—to every nation,</h4>

<h4>tribe, language and people.</h4>

<h4>He said in a loud voice,</h4>

<h5>“Fear God and give him glory, because the hour</h5>

<h5>of his judgment has come. Worship him who</h5>

<h5>made the heavens, the earth, the sea</h5>

<h5>and the springs of water.”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 14:6-7</h6>

<p>(7) The seventh phase of the harvest is <strong>peace</strong>. In this
section surrounding the <em>seventh thunder</em>, Jesus marches to
war and wins a victory, ensuring eternal peace and kicking
off the wedding supper. Once again we hear Solomon’s
clock ticking, as the final battle in the war and the ensuing
peace are heralded by this last thunder:</p>

<h4>I saw heaven standing open and there before me</h4>

<h4>was a white horse, whose rider is called</h4>

<h4>Faithful and True. With justice he judges and</h4>

<h4><strong>wages war</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 19:11</h6>

<h2>John’s Seven Signs</h2>

<p>If fitting the twenty-eight times to Revelation looks
forced, we can turn to the Gospel of John for
reinforcement. John speaks of seven signs that Jesus
performed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing Water Into Wine (John 2:1-11)</li>
<li>Healing the Official's Son (John 4:46-54)</li>
<li>Healing the paralytic (John 5:1-18)</li>
<li>Feeding the 5,000 (John 6:1-14)</li>
<li>Walking on water (John 6:15-25)</li>
<li>Healing a man born blind (John 9:1-41)</li>
<li>Raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-46)</li>
</ol>

<p>These signs (and other events in their containing
chapters) point to the twenty-eight times and the harvest
pattern – in reverse. This shows Jesus, the prince of peace,
progressing towards a time to die, followed by a time to be
born – his resurrection.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty</strong>. The twenty-eight times begin with the peace of
the final wedding (the wedding at Cana). The good wine
served last is singled out as indicating a reversal of the
normal order of things. This is the clue that Solomon’s
pattern of times proceed in reverse. Wine also symbolizes
God’s wrath and the time of war, while Jesus’ loving
submission to his mother’s wishes captures the theme of
loyalty.</p>

<p><strong>Community</strong>. The healing of the official’s son happens in
the same chapter as the story of the Samaritan woman at
the well. That story is about mending the tear between Jews
and Samaritans and about Jesus <em>speaking</em> and people
<em>listening</em>, such as the grieving official. Also, Jesus speaks to
his disciples about how the harvest is ripe, pointing to the
harvest phase.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>. The paralytic is chastised by Jesus to stop
sinning, like the Father who disciplines us in the pruning
phase. The man complains that when the water of the pool
is stirred (suggesting an angel’s arrival), he always <em>loses</em> the
opportunity to enter because other people beat him to it.
Jesus tells him to <em>keep</em> his mat with him, earning the ire of
the religious leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Amity</strong>. In John’s harvest pattern (but not the times), just
as with Job 3 and Revelation’s fourth and fifth trumpets
earlier in this appendix, parts four and five are again
reversed. Walking on water and calming the disciples fear
in the fifth sign belongs to the watering phase (the fourth
harvest phase) whereas feeding the five thousand bread
corresponds to the seed of the fourth, the planting phase.</p>

<p>During the feeding of the crowd, the disciples cooperate
with Jesus in the working of the miracle, part of a strong
relationship. They scatter the bread then gather the
remains. However, afterwards the people try to embrace
Jesus in the wrong way – to make him king by force. He
<em>refrains</em> from embracing their designs and leaves.</p>

<p><strong>Stability</strong>. The storm-tossed lake is the opposite of
stability and Jesus’ calmness its epitome. The disciples were
afraid until Jesus spoke and brought gladness to their
hearts.</p>

<p><strong>Ability</strong>. The most striking of the connections to the
harvest is the man born blind, who matches the plowing
phase of suffering. Like Job, the man is falsely accused by
religious leaders of being born a sinner. Then, Jesus asks
him if he believes in the Son of Man, which Bildad
ridiculed, and Job embraced. In the end, the man
experiencing “a time to heal” gained the physical ability to
see, but also a mental ability to reason correctly about the
Messiah which the learned lacked.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong>. Lazarus meets his times to die and to be born
miraculously in reverse. However, the chief priests and
pharisees worried that “the Romans will come and take
away both our place and our nation.” That would be “a
time to uproot”. The story of Lazarus also roots Jesus to
Solomon’s larger timescale of “a time to weep”, for it shows
Jesus weeping.</p>

<p>Taking the Gospel of John and Revelation as a unit, we
have a chiasm. The first leg with the twenty-eight times in
reverse in the Gospel shows Jesus condescending from his
position of heavenly peace to suffer, die and rise again.
Then Revelation proceeds in forward order, as Christ
liberates his beloved and carries the church up to eternal
peace in heaven.</p>

<h2>The Seven Thunders, Unsealed (sort of)</h2>

<p>Why did God command John to seal up the seven
thunders? Peruse the internet and you will find rampant
speculation about what was concealed but nothing about
what was revealed. God’s purpose stands. By His glory He
has concealed this matter; it is up to kings to search it out. I
say concealed, not excluded, because the command to John
to not write down what the seven thunders said was a
challenge to the lover of God’s word to search, not give up.
John’s obedient act of not writing their words down only
makes knowing what the seven thunders said impossible 
<em>if they never spoke before</em>.</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>The seven thunders have not been silent;</p>
  <p>we have not been listening.</p>
</div>

<p>Job complained that he could not hear God speak in the
same chapter where he prophesied Christ walking on
water. Solomon argued that only by knowing the future –
which only God could see – could one be at peace, yet his
book sets down God’s plan for all of history. Paul scolded
women that they should not presume to teach men but
instead listen, but that fell within a prophetic framework
that lays out God’s plan to liberate women from bondage.
God hides his secrets well, behind words of despair,
seeming misogyny, and the threat of plagues (which
conclude Revelation).</p>

<p>Only a person with steadfast purpose, humility and the
assistance of the Holy Spirit can search them out. I had
none of those qualities when I began. If I have succeeded,
even partially, it is by grace. God helped me search for
decades for things I wasn’t even sure were there.</p>

<p>Besides the words that John heard and did not record,
the Seven Thunders spoke four times: in Job, Exodus,
Psalms and elsewhere in Revelation. Four times seven is
twenty-eight. We have seen that Solomon’s times are
sprinkled about Revelation in an orderly way. One
speculation is that if John wrote down the words of the
Seven Thunders, humanity would have too much
information about the timing of God’s plans. This could
cause distress (the years are too many to bear) or
complacency (we have plenty of time to keep sinning and
put off repenting). I offer an opposing conclusion. If the
words of the Seven Thunders were spelled out, we would
have thirty-five units of judgment described, obscuring the
relationship to Ecclesiastes’ twenty-eight times. By
withholding those words about the details of His
judgments, God made the big picture clearer.</p>

<p>Revelation is God’s judgment for violating His laws. Many
of the Ten Commandments are cited in Revelation as God’s
set of formal charges against mankind. If laws and plagues
are present in the words outside of those spoken by the
Seven Thunders, they are likely contained within those
words. Another speculation I have read is that the plagues
God concealed are so horrible, no one could bear to hear of
them. Their very cruelty would turn people away from God
or cause the righteous to faint, if persecutions were
revealed. However, the seven bowl judgments are called the
last plagues. They are the apex of God’s wrath. It is not
likely that worse plagues than those already described were
revealed. However, if a worse plague is described, here is
what it <em>might</em> be.</p>

<p><strong>Plague?</strong> What we are deducing about the seven thunders
is based on lack of information. Sometimes the fact that
something is missing is information. Most of the ten plagues
of Moses are represented in Revelation. If one is not
mirrored in Revelation, perhaps it was mentioned in the
suppressed message of the seven thunders? Setting aside
gnats, which could indicate an insect-borne plague, we
have the plague on the firstborn. The correlation shown in
the chart several pages back was to a judgement against the
children of the fourth church, not the entire unbelieving
world. In Exodus, this was the ultimate plague. In Moses’
Monthly Planner, the tenth plague must fall in the tenth
era, opposite the tenth commandment, “Thou shalt not
covet…”</p>

<p>That pairing of a plague on the firstborn with
covetousness is peculiar. It makes the most sense to me if a
scenario like this comes to pass. A breakdown in public
order, rising crime, disruption in agriculture, energy, and
transport combine to create food shortages. The
totalitarian regimes of Behemoth and Leviathan then
introduce China’s famous “one child” policy on a
worldwide scale to prevent famine and manage scarce
resources. Environmental policies against pesticides permit
insects to multiply. A massive outbreak of insect-borne
disease (the missing “gnats”) is countered by accelerated
vaccine development. Because of religious persecution, all
Christians and Jews are denied access to the vaccine.</p>

<p>Corporate greed and government bribes coverup short-
term side-effects in children. The vaccine is rolled out
before the fatal long term effects materialize. 
<em>In a world with a “one child” policy, every child is a firstborn.</em> 
The plague is the ultimate plague on the firstborn: 
every vaccinated child on the planet dies.</p>

<p>Now only faithful Christians and Jews have children. A
violent, covetous world sets out to steal the children of the
faithful and make them their own, else the whole of the
beasts’ civilization will swiftly end.</p>

<p>That would be a plague so terrifying, so final, that God
just might want to leave it out of the Bible. Or perhaps that
sheds light on the meaning of Jesus’ words in Mark:</p>

<h4>“If the Lord had not cut short those days,</h4>

<h4>no one would survive. But for the sake</h4>

<h4>of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has</h4>

<h4>shortened them.”</h4>

<h6>- Mark 13:20</h6>

<p>Killing over a billion children in one month may be more
than a merciful God will consent to do. To conform to the
pattern, the process of the Lord’s escalating judgments
would eventually get to a calamity of this magnitude unless
Jesus returns first to end all warfare. Maranatha. I pray,
Lord, please return before it comes to this.</p>

<p><strong>Personal message?</strong> If not the declaration of a series of
plagues, then what? Some think John received a personal
message. However, John was by then a wise old man. He
would be able to tell a private message from one that affects
other people.</p>

<p><strong>Praise</strong>! Where does that leave us? If you paid attention,
every thunder passage in Revelation was near a place
where people worshiped and praised God. They sang,
played harps, fell down, shouted, and prayed. Plagues? Yes.
Judgments? Yes. But the Seven Thunders must certainly
have included a mighty word of praise. Much of the
curiosity I see about this chapter is about the disasters –
what will the news headlines be? Can we put it in an end
times movie? Some curiosity is about the timing – we crave
to know things before they happen. It makes us feel
powerful and proud to have secret knowledge.</p>

<p>Nobody ever asks what it is that the Seven Thunders
praised God for! Why? It is because people do not know the
power of praise. God is not afraid to lose nuclear codes or
fighter plane designs to demonic spies. He cares nothing for
the latest submarine engine silencers or Iron Dome
schematics.</p>

<p>Remember the Song of Moses? That song composed by
Moses prophetically prepared Joshua to recognize the
commander of the hosts of the Lord when he appeared
with drawn sword. Because of that song, Jericho fell. How
important is that song in God’s plan? They are still singing
that song in heaven!</p>

<h4>They held harps given them by God and <strong>sang the</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb</strong>:</h4>

<h5>“Great and marvelous are your deeds,</h5>

<h6>Lord God Almighty.</h6>

<h5>Just and true are your ways,</h5>

<h6>King of the nations.</h6>

<h6>- Revelation 15:2-3</h6>

<p>That passage abbreviates the song. It shall be sung just
before the last seven plagues are released. That song is a
channel for God’s power.</p>

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>I believe that the Seven Thunders</p>
  <p>were teaching John a new song.</p>
</div>

<p>What was that new song about? Nobody but John, Jesus
and that mighty angel know. But I believe it is possible to
hear an echo of its soaring language and sublime themes by
studying the Psalms. Earlier in this chapter, I shared a few
connections between the Psalms of thunder (Psalms 18, 29,
68, 77, 81, 93 and 104) and Revelation, Job, and Exodus. At
that time, I didn’t know the structure of Revelation well
enough to see how marvelously the Psalms and Revelation
are connected. Each of the seven psalms, in order,
corresponds to a thunder section in Revelation. The points
of connection are our clues to the song that will one day
top the charts.</p>

<p>In what follows, verses from each psalm alternate with
matching verses from Revelation.</p>

<h2>Psalm 18: Sing the Secret Song in the Key of Life</h2>

<p>The first thunder psalm tells us Jesus has the key to set
people free from death and the will to use it.</p>

<p>Psalm</p>

<h4>The cords of death entangled me;</h4>

<h5>the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 18:4</h6>

<p>Revelation</p>

<h4>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.</h4>

<h4>Then he placed his right hand on me and said:</h4>

<h5>“Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</h5>

<h5>I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look,</h5>

<h5>I am alive for ever and ever!</h5>

<h5><strong>And I hold the keys of death and Hades</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 1:17-18</h6>

<p>Both psalm and scroll agree that Jesus will come riding
on the clouds.</p>

<p>Psalm</p>

<h4>He parted the heavens and came down;</h4>

<h5>dark clouds were under his feet.</h5>

<h4>He mounted the cherubim and flew;</h4>

<h5>he soared on the wings of the wind.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 18:9-10</h6>

<p>Revelation</p>

<h4>“Look, he is coming with the clouds,”</h4>

<h5>and “every eye will see him,</h5>

<h6>even those who pierced him”;</h6>

<h4>and all peoples on earth</h4>

<h5>“will mourn because of him.”</h5>

<h4>So shall it be! Amen.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 1:7</h6>

<h2>Psalm 29: The Secret Song will Glorify our Holy God</h2>

<p>In this psalm, King David commanded the “heavenly
beings” to ascribe glory to God and acknowledge His
holiness. It is certain that the mighty angel of Revelation 10
was bound by this kingly demand.</p>

<p>Psalm</p>

<h4>Ascribe to the LORD, you <strong>heavenly beings</strong>,</h4>

<h5>ascribe to the LORD <strong>glory</strong> and strength.</h5>

<h4>Ascribe to the LORD the <strong>glory</strong> due his name;</h4>

<h5>worship the LORD in the splendor of his <strong>holiness</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 29:1-2</h6>

<p>Revelation</p>

<h4>Each of the four living creatures had six wings</h4>

<h4>and was covered with eyes all around,</h4>

<h4>even under its wings. Day and night they</h4>

<h4>never stop saying:</h4>

<h5>“ <strong>‘Holy, holy, holy</strong> is the Lord God Almighty,’</h5>

<h5>who was, and is, and is to come.”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 4:8, NIV</h6>

<p>Psalm</p>

<h4>The voice of the LORD twists the oaks</h4>

<h5>and strips the forests bare.</h5>

<h6>And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 29:9</h6>

<p>Revelation</p>

<h4>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,</h4>

<h4>to receive <strong>glory</strong> and honor and power,</h4>

<h4>for you created all things,</h4>

<h4>and by your will they were created</h4>

<h4>and have their being.”</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 4:11</h6>

<h2>Psalm 68: The Secret Song is filled with Saving Words</h2>

<p>The humble are saved while the mighty flee in terror. The
surprising verse is Psalm 68:11. This matching section in
Revelation describes the breaking of the seven seals. The
third psalm in the sequence matches the third seal, the
time of the locust-like colonial empires, the advent of
capitalism and the time when women were set free to
become missionaries. In that era, the first woman to
become a minister in the United States was ordained. Truly,
the Lord announced the word and women began to
proclaim it in a mighty throng, because they too were
finally beginning to be set free.</p>

<p>As I write these words, I am listening to a Christian
worship song in which a chorus of women are singing
about Jesus coming on the clouds, followed by the words,
“Out of Zion’s Hill salvation comes.” Tears stream down my
face, because heaven is telling me these words are true.</p>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>The Lord announces the word,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng</strong>:</h5>

<h4><strong>“Kings and armies flee in haste</strong>;</h4>

<h5>the women at home divide the plunder.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 68:11-12</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>Then <strong>the kings of the earth, the princes</strong>,</h4>

<h4><strong>the generals, the rich, the mighty</strong>, and</h4>

<h4>everyone else, both slave and free,</h4>

<h4><strong>hid in caves</strong> and among the rocks of the mountains.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 6:15</h6>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior,</h4>

<h5>who daily bears our burdens.</h5>

<h4><strong>Our God is a God who saves</strong>;</h4>

<h5>from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 68:19-20</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>And they cried out in a loud voice:</h4>

<h5>“<strong>Salvation belongs to our God</strong>,</h5>

<h4>who sits on the throne,</h4>

<h5>and to the Lamb.”</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 7:10, NIV</h6>

<h2>Psalm 77: The Secret Song will both Recall and Render the Miraculous</h2>

<p>When King Jehoshaphat marched out against a much
larger army, his soldiers sang a song about the miracles that
the Lord had performed to rescue them in the past, and He
renewed His saving works in their day. Their enemies
turned against each other and the victory was Judah’s.
When the Mighty Angel shouts his thunderous chorus, the
miraculous will occur.</p>

<p>Psalm 77 recalls God’s rescue of Israel from Egypt by the
ten plagues and in Revelation the Lord grants that
miraculous power to the church to use in its time of need.</p>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>I will remember the deeds of the LORD;</h4>

<h5>yes, I will remember your <strong>miracles</strong> of long ago.</h5>

<h4>I will consider all your works</h4>

<h5>and meditate on all your <strong>mighty deeds</strong>.”</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 77:11-12</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>If anyone tries to harm them, <strong>fire comes</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>from their mouths and devours their enemies</strong>.</h4>

<h4>This is how anyone who wants to harm them</h4>

<h4>must die. They have <strong>power to shut up</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>the heavens</strong> so that it will not rain during</h4>

<h4>the time they are prophesying; and they have</h4>

<h4><strong>power to turn the waters into blood</strong> and</h4>

<h4>to strike the earth with <strong>every kind of plague</strong></h4>

<h4>as often as they want.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 11:5-6</h6>

<h2>Psalm 81: The Secret Song will Offer Worship to the Triune God</h2>

<p>Once in Revelation 13 do the inhabitants of the earth
worship the dragon, and three times the beast. That is their
one false god and corrupt trinity. The Secret Song will offer
worship not to a foreign god, but to the thrice holy God – to
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>Hear me, my people, and I will warn you—</h4>

<h5>if you would only listen to me, Israel!</h5>

<h4><strong>You shall have no foreign god among you</strong>;</h4>

<h5><strong>you shall not worship any god other than me</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 81:8-9</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>People <strong>worshiped the dragon</strong> because he</h4>

<h4>had given authority to the beast, and they</h4>

<h4>also <strong>worshiped the beast</strong> and asked,</h4>

<h5>“Who is like the beast? Who can wage war</h5>

<h5>against it?”</h5>

<h4>All inhabitants of the earth will</h4>

<h4><strong>worship the beast</strong>—all whose names have</h4>

<h4>not been written in the Lamb’s book of life,</h4>

<h4>the Lamb who was slain from the creation</h4>

<h4>of the world. It exercised all the authority</h4>

<h4>of the first beast on its behalf, and made</h4>

<h4>the earth and its inhabitants <strong>worship the</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>first beast</strong>, whose fatal wound had been healed.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 13:4,8,12</h6>

<h2>Psalm 93: The Secret Song will proclaim the Gospel</h2>

<p>Though no one but the 144,000 redeemed can learn the
“new song” of this passage in Revelation 14, surely the
psalmist overheard a few bars from one of the rehearsals.
Both psalm and scroll speak of God’s throne and of a voice
like the pounding surf. Surely God’s eternal statutes are
synonymous with the eternal gospel.</p>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4><strong>Your throne</strong> was established long ago;</h4>

<h5>you are from all <strong>eternity</strong>.</h5>

<h4>The seas have lifted up, LORD,</h4>

<h5><strong>the seas have lifted up their voice</strong>;</h5>

<h6>the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.</h6>

<h4><strong>Mightier than the thunder of the great waters</strong>,</h4>

<h5>mightier than the breakers of the sea—</h5>

<h6>the LORD on high is mighty.</h6>

<h4><strong>Your statutes, LORD, stand firm</strong>;</h4>

<h5>holiness adorns your house</h5>

<h6><strong>for endless days</strong>.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 93:2-5</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>And I heard a sound from heaven like</h4>

<h4><strong>the roar of rushing waters</strong> and like a</h4>

<h4><strong>loud peal of thunder</strong>. The sound I heard</h4>

<h4>was like that of harpists playing their harps.</h4>

<h4>And they sang a new song before the <strong>throne</strong></h4>

<h4>and before the four living creatures and</h4>

<h4>the elders. No one could learn the song except</h4>

<h4>the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the</h4>

<h4>earth... Then I saw another angel flying</h4>

<h4>in midair, and he had <strong>the eternal gospel</strong></h4>

<h4>to proclaim to those who live on the earth—</h4>

<h4>to every nation, tribe, language and people.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 14:2,3,6</h6>

<h2>Psalm 104: The Secret Song will Resolve</h2>

<p>In music, resolution is when a song ends with a pleasing
chord, when the dissonance that created suspense and
unease is cast aside and a satisfying emotional response
results. This song will resolve. Babylon the Great will drink
from the cup of wrath, while the faithful will drink from the
spring of the water of life. Leviathan will frolic no more.
The dissonance of earthquake aftershocks will subside once
prophet and beast are thrown into the fiery lake. Then we
will meet the Beginning and the End – the happy end.</p>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>He set the earth on its foundations;</h4>

<h5><strong>it can never be moved</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 104:5</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings,</h4>

<h4>peals of thunder and a severe earthquake.</h4>

<h4><strong>No earthquake like it has ever occurred</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>was the quake</strong>. The great city split into</h4>

<h4>three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed.</h4>

<h4>God remembered Babylon the Great and <strong>gave her</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>the cup</strong> filled with the wine of the fury of</h4>

<h4>his wrath. <strong>Every island fled away and the</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>mountains could not be found</strong>.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 16:18-20</h6>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4><strong>He makes springs pour water into the ravines</strong>;</h4>

<h5>it flows between the mountains.</h5>

<h4><strong>They give water to all the beasts of the field</strong>;</h4>

<h5>the wild donkeys <strong>quench their thirst</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Psalm 104:10-11</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>He said to me:</h4>

<h5>“It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega,</h5>

<h5>the Beginning and the End.</h5>

<h5><strong>To the thirsty I will give water without</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>cost from the spring of the water of life</strong>.</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 21:6</h6>

<p>Psalm:</p>

<h4>There is the sea, vast and spacious,</h4>

<h5>teeming with creatures beyond number—</h5>

<h6>living things both large and small.</h6>

<h4><strong>There the ships go to and fro</strong>,</h4>

<h5>and <strong>Leviathan</strong>,</h5>

<h6>which you formed to frolic there.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 104:25-26</h6>

<p>Revelation:</p>

<h4>‘In one hour such great wealth</h4>

<h4>has been brought to ruin!’</h4>

<h4><strong>“Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship,</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>the sailors, and all who earn their living</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>from the sea</strong>, will stand far off. When they see</h4>

<h4>the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim,</h4>

<h5>‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’</h5>

<h6>- Revelation 18:17-18</h6>

<p>and:</p>

<h4><strong>But the beast was captured</strong>, and with it</h4>

<h4>the false prophet who had performed the signs</h4>

<h4>on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded</h4>

<h4>those who had received the mark of the beast</h4>

<h4>and worshiped its image. The two of them were</h4>

<h4>thrown alive into the fiery lake of</h4>

<h4>burning sulfur.</h4>

<h6>- Revelation 19:20, NIV</h6>

<p>The mystery in Revelation that intrigues people the most
is what the seven thunders spoke. It intrigued me, too,
when I was writing my first books. But one of my
characters, named Bill Canto, was on a different quest.
While the hero tried to escape judgment and go backwards,
to leave the Courtlands of the Afterlife and return to life on
earth, Bill longed to move forward. He was not running
from something, but towards it. Bill was searching for a
song. He walked every road in the afterlife in search of a
mystic strain just beyond his hearing. He finally found it.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I longed to be able to write a song.
When I returned from my first mission trip, I was able to
write that song. “Do you have a heart? Then love the
Lord…”</p>

<p>Revelation has another mystery. The fact that it attracts
less attention does not mean that it is a less important
mystery to solve. It means that many people do not
recognize how deep and critical a mystery it is to solve.
That mystery is the “new song” that only the 144,000
redeemed people in Revelation 7 and 14 will be privileged
to learn.</p>

<p>Why is that song limited to a select few? Copyright
regulations? Licensing deals? One answer is honor. God has
accorded them a great honor in recognition of their faithful
service. It is one of the heavenly rewards that differ in
degree from person to person.</p>

<p>Another answer is that the song is imbued with great
power. It must be employed strategically by those whose
great faith and obedience will ensure that when sung, it has
the intended effect at just the right time.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Among other things, the voice of the Seven
Thunders was teaching the Apostle John a song. Was it the
“new song”, making John one of the 144,000? Given that
John is one of the apostles and they are addressed as a
group in Revelation, probably not. So it may be a different
song, a solo number. If John is one of the twenty-four
elders, that would be weird, because he would have seen
himself in his vision, but it would mean he speaks or sings
whatever they do. However, the likeliest arrangement for
this song is as a duet. His singing partner will be his brother
James, martyred years before. Why should we think this?
Because of the name that Jesus gave to the two of them:</p>

<h4>These are the twelve he appointed:</h4>

<h5>Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),</h5>

<h5><strong>James son of Zebedee and his brother John</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>(to them he gave the name Boanerges,</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>which means “sons of thunder”),</strong></h5>

<h5>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,</h5>

<h5>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus,</h5>

<h5>Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</h5>

<h5>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</h5>

<h6>- Mark 3:16-19</h6>

<p>If Jesus called James and John “sons of thunder”, so they
shall be.</p>

<p>Whatever song it is, John was forbidden to share it,
because the honor of singing it belongs to him, not just any
Bible reader. This also means that he was forbidden to sing
it at that time. He must wait to sing it and we must wait to
hear it. And when John and James sing that song, the voice
of thunder will be theirs, and they will shake the world.</p>

<h2>Prophecies will cease…</h2>

<p>Jesus said that the law would be fulfilled, and now we see
how far advanced that process is. After observing all these
prophetic connections between history and Scripture, what
should we take away?</p>

<h4>Love never fails.</h4>

<h4><strong>But where there are prophecies, they will cease;</strong></h4>

<h4>where there are tongues, they will be stilled;</h4>

<h4>where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</h4>

<h6>- 1 Corinthians 13:8</h6>

<p>Searching for meaning hidden in God’s Word keeps us
busy and brings delight when we find it. Its warnings of
danger may save lives. It encourages our faith, but it is
transitory. It will cease. John’s song of thunder may shake
the world of tomorrow, but we have songs to sing today.
The Ten Commandments may speak helpful words about
the future, but they are meant for today, to guide is into
greater holiness. Who cares if you figure out when the Lord
will return, if the blackness in your soul marks you as one
who will be left behind?</p>

<p>Whether you are musically inclined or not, whether by
vocals, or through works of art, or words of encouragement
to a stranger, God has a song for you to sing. Listen for its
strains, work out the meter, memorize the tune, practice it,
and belt it out. Be a son or daughter of the thunder,
because this world needs shaking up.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightning are the hallmarks of a storm.
Thunder scares my Shelty (who is not named Donner).
Thunder and wind make animals scamper into a cave or
burrow. Thunder is not a token of peace.</p>

<p>Part of my journey to peace included a dream about a
storm. Storms divide lives into three parts. There is the
time before the storm, the time during the storm, and the
time after the storm. Building a foundation of faith in Jesus
gives us peace during the first part, while we are building
our lives. Standing on that faith gives us peace during the
storm. Entering into sabbath rest because we survived the
storm gives us peace at the end.</p>

<p>Those are three different kinds of peace. We need all
three. Solomon’s well-planned life with its ordered set of
times provides the first. It takes time to built a good life.
The ultimate triumph of God’s plans that we have seen laid
out in prophecy are a foretaste of the third. Our peace is to
be eternal, so God has not neglected His work of ages.
Thunder is not like those two. Thunder is chaotic. Thunder
is jarring. Storms create panic. Every second is precious.
This is what the angel of Revelation 10 said after the seven
thunders spoke:</p>

<h4>Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea</h4>

<h4>and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.</h4>

<h4>And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever,</h4>

<h4>who created the heavens and all that is in them,</h4>

<h4>the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and</h4>

<h4>all that is in it, and said,</h4>

<h5><strong>“There will be no more delay!"</strong></h5>

<h6>- Revelation 10:5-6, NIV</h6>

<p>I prefer the King James on this. It says, <em>“There should be time no longer.”</em> 
Saying there will be no more delay means
that time has run out for this crisis. The King James says
that time has runout, period. Time itself is over. That is final.</p>

<p>That is what storms do to you. They make you panic and
convince you that you have no time left. You must act
instantly. In such times, faithful Christians must trust the
God of the seven thunders to speak wisdom and peace into
their souls, just like they did with John, just like they did
with the psalmist:</p>

<h4>Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,</h4>

<h5>your lightning lit up the world;</h5>

<h6>the earth trembled and quaked.</h6>

<h4>Your path led through the sea,</h4>

<h5>your way through the mighty waters,</h5>

<h6><strong>though your footprints were not seen</strong>.</h6>

<h6>- Psalm 77:18-19, NIV</h6>

<p>This book has shown the footprints leading up to the
storm and the footprints leading out of the storm. The
middle way is God’s, and as Job would agree, only He
knows that way.</p>

<p>Stick close. We need a shepherd.</p>
