title: What are the Heavenly Treasures?
quote: For where your treasure is, <br/> there your heart will be also. <br/> - Matthew 6:21

After I memorized the Sermon on the Mount over thirty years ago,
something jumped out at me.

#### “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, 
##### where moth and rust destroy and 
##### where thieves break in and steal, 
#### but **lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven**, 
##### where neither moth nor rust destroys and 
##### where thieves do not break in and steal. 
#### For where your treasure is, 
##### there your heart will be also.
###### - Matthew 6:19-21

Jesus doesn't tell us what the heavenly treasures are!
I spent over a decade searching and came up with a list.
My list is likely incomplete, but at least I have something to go on. 
This list is fully explored in my first nonfiction book of theology, 
*The Endless Hunt: Or if I've Found God, Why am I still Looking?*

In the article [What are life's Most Important Questions?](./most-important-questions.html),
there are three questions that touch on heavenly treasures:

  - Where do I begin?
  - What’s my Goal?
  - What’s Valuable to acquire along the way?

**The answer to the first is that we must begin with the "fear of the Lord".**

Helpfully, the Bible makes this plain as the nose on your face.

#### The fear of the LORD is the **beginning** of wisdom, 
##### and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
###### - Proverbs 9:10

**The answer to the second is that our goal is the "glory of God".**

In support of this is the Westminster Shorter Catechism, which begins with this question:

#### Q: What is the chief end of man?
#### A: Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.

**The answer to the third is the subject of this article.**

In *The Endless Hunt*, I included the "fear of the Lord" and the "glory of God" in the list
of treasures. They do triple duty as guidance, goal, and glorious treasure.
Here is the complete list:

  - the Fear of the Lord
  - Eternal Life
  - Family
  - Work & Rest
  - Authority & Purpose
  - Love
  - Wisdom, Justice & Truth
  - Courage & Protection
  - Freedom
  - Happiness & Generosity
  - Joy
  - the Glory of God

The middle ten may be categorized to reveal the inner logic of such treasures:

  - Being (Eternal Life)
  - Establishing (relationships to Family, Career and Society)
  - Nurturing (love, wisdom, justice & truth, courage & protection)
  - Flourishing (freedom, happiness & generosity, joy)

The categories themselves have scriptural support.

## Being

What is life but existence instead of nonexistence?
The two greatest gifts that God gives to us are our existence and His.
All are given life once. We who believe are given life twice.
The indwelling Holy Spirit and communion with Father and Son are the
ultimate treasure. To certify that our very being is a treasure,
we have this exchange between God and Moses:  

#### Then Moses said to God, 
##### “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 
##### ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ 
##### and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ 
##### what shall I say to them?” 
#### God said to Moses, 
##### “I AM WHO I AM.” And he said, 
##### “Say this to the people of Israel: 
##### ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”
###### - Exodus 3:13-14

God calls Himself "I AM". He is existence itself.

## Establishing

What roots us in the world are the relationships we have with other people.
How important is this? The first Psalm, written by a man after God's own heart,
captures this truth best:

#### He is like a tree
##### planted by streams of water
#### that yields its fruit in its season,
##### and its leaf does not wither.
#### In all that he does, he prospers.
###### - Psalm 1:3

Humans are not trees. We are not planted in dirt. We are planted
in families, towns, churches, schools, nations and a multitude of 
other relationships. These relationships may be a source of trial
or treasure. The value of these relationships is a paradox.

#### If possible, so far as it depends on you, 
##### live peaceably with all.
###### - Romans 12:18

When the believer, living out Jesus' call to be a peacemaker, 
spreads peace around them, what are they doing? They are treasuring
the people around them. Such a person becomes the treasured friend to their 
roommate, the treasured spouse to husband or wife, or the treasured 
colleague at work. When we all treasure our relationships, then
we make it possible for the world in our neighborhood to flourish.

## Nourishing

The principle spiritual treasure in this category is love.
It governs all the rest. We know that love is a treasure because of what John said:

#### Anyone who does not love does not know God, 
##### because God is love.
###### - 1 John 4:8

That is a pretty strong endorsement. An even better endorsement is 
found in 1 Corinthians. Jesus told us that the thing we are searching for in a heavenly treasure
is that it is eternal, not perishable. Paul identified three:

#### Love never ends. 
#### As for prophecies, they will pass away; 
#### as for tongues, they will cease; 
#### as for knowledge, it will pass away...
#### So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; 
#### but the greatest of these is love.
###### - 1 Corinthians 13:8,13

A point can be made that my list of treasures should also include faith and hope.
They are indispensable supports for courage, which is on my list.
If we add them, they also belong to the nourishing category.
Of course, hope acts in service to love:

#### it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, 
#### but rejoices with the **truth**. 
#### Love bears all things, 
#### **believes** all things, 
#### **hopes all things**, 
#### endures all things.  
#### - 1 Corinthians 13:6-7 (ESV)

Here we see that love includes faith (believes or trusts), truth and hope. Of course, I prefer the NIV for
verse 7, because it also brings in protection:

#### It always **protects**, always trusts, 
#### always hopes, always perseveres. 
###### - 1 Corinthians 13:7 (NIV)

So many treasures are entangled with love that it is hard to sort them out!

## Flourishing

The transcendant treasures are what we all crave. From joy, a fruit of the Spirit, 
to freedom, sought in desperation by generations of slaves, to the basic happiness
of a bountiful life. The trouble is not in the identification, but the pursuit.

I find it telling that the American Declaration of Independence endorses several 
of the treasures on my list:

#### We hold these **truths** to be self-evident, 
#### that all men are created equal, 
#### that they are endowed by their Creator 
#### with certain unalienable Rights, 
#### that among these are **Life**, **Liberty** and the pursuit of **Happiness**.

What I called treasures Jefferson called unalienable rights. His selection comes from 
the first category (being, by reference to life) and the fourth (flourishing). 
Jefferson appeals to eternal truth from the third category (nurturing) to prove his 
assertions and "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God" to authorize them, which touches on
the final treasure, the glory of God. To secure these rights, America's founders focused 
on reforming part of the second category (establishing), our relationship to society, or more 
specifically government. These people knew that "the pursuit of happiness" can easily
be thwarted by an ill-structured, tyrannical society. They knew that it is not
easy to create the conditions for general prosperity. To secure the most desired 
treasures you must first build out their supports, a just and equal society.

There is one philosophical difficulty with the declaration. It is a misunderstanding
that we all share when young and many never overcome. Are we really to pursue happiness?
Are we to pursue joy? Rather, we should practice love for God, love for neighbor and enjoy 
fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Pursue those and happiness results. Pursue those and joy
abounds. The alternative is to pursue alcohol, drugs, and all sorts of immoral activities
to capture the feelings that simulate happiness and joy. 

The counterfeits are all about grasping for, taking, consuming and discarding. 
The real treasures are about giving. You can work out a very detailed and lengthy list of 
spiritual treasures and fall short on the ways and means of acquiring them.
The paradox is that every spiritual treasure arises from a transaction involving 
a perishable treasure. This is God's currency exchange. He gives us the eternal
in exchange for worthless, perishable things, but we have to surrender them first.
In my search for spiritual treasures, this Bible verse was immensely helpful:

#### Jesus said to him, 
##### “If you would be perfect, 
##### go, sell what you possess 
##### and give to the poor, 
##### and you will have treasure in heaven; 
##### and come, follow me.”
###### - Matthew 19:21

The verse comes from the story of the rich young ruler, who in the end could not part with 
his wealth. Jesus tells us plainly that giving to the poor is one way to store
up treasure in Heaven. However, what heavenly treasure results from such a transaction?
What do you get when you give to the poor?

The Lord explained this to me years ago. After I made a contribution to a ministry that helped
the poor, I felt regret over being so generous. O, how greed and insecurity foment objections
when we try to follow Christ's teachings! It is not easy to part with something
that we would rather keep. That experience showed me that I was not as generous as I thought.
What did I do? I prayed, "Lord, grant me a generous heart." You see, in the end it was not
my great generosity that caused me to give to the poor. It was my giving to the poor 
that started me down the path to generosity. 

**Generosity does not make you give. Giving makes you generous.**

So when you give to the poor, God adds generosity to your heavenly bank account.

#### Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD, 
##### and he will repay him for his deed.
###### - Proverbs 19:17

In like fashion, freedom comes from revering and following the Law while joy comes from 
entering into the suffering of others to comfort them:

#### looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, 
#### who for the **joy** that was set before him endured the cross, 
#### despising the shame, and is seated at 
#### the right hand of the throne of God.
###### - Hebrews 12:2

Of all the truths I have struggled to understand in my life, this was perhaps 
the most difficult. The recognition of joy as a desirable, transcendent experience 
is universal. Throughout my late teens and most of my twenties, I was depressed.
I craved nothing more than to experience joy, but it was far off and I didn't
know how to get to it. In February 1986, I went on a Christian retreat up to 
New Hampshire. The subject of the retreat was the Book of Philippians.
The meaning of these words tantalized me:

#### Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, 
#### if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, 
#### if any tenderness and compassion, then **make my joy complete** 
#### by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit 
#### and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. 
#### Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 
#### not looking to your own interests but each of you 
#### to the interests of the others.
#### - Philippians 2:1-4 (NIV)

There was a veil over my eyes. I couldn't understand what they were saying.
Halfway through the retreat, I asked to leave. Someone drove me back to Boston. 
In Philippians, Paul uses words like joy, joyful, and rejoice fourteen times.
The very message that my soul needed to hear to be rescued from depression
bounced off my hard heart. The words were in English. They weren't complicated.
When I bolted from the retreat I didn't even know what the difficulty was.
My mind did not know the nature of my objections to this teaching but my heart did.
It refused to believe that the path to joy required sacrificial service to others.
It could not fathom that by emptying himself for humanity, Jesus acquired a
greater joy.

How can visiting suffering people bring you joy? How can adding more problems
to your life lessen them? What was being asked of me was impossible.
The miraculous thing is that those words of Philippians that I did not understand
burrowed into my heart and began to grow. Over the course of the next several 
years I slowly opened up to taking risks to help others. This culminated
on the day I visited a dying woman near my apartment in Somerville. 
After visiting with Janet and praying for her, I was cut to the heart. 
I had never seen anyone in such pain. I left her place bawling. 
I never cried so hard for someone besides myself as I did that day.
And then the power of God proved my wretched fears wrong. My tears stopped,
peace settled in my heart, and then my soul was flooded with joy.
That joy remained with me for a solid week. Neither before nor since have I ever felt
its equal. 

It was a Sunday. After church ended, I raced back to my apartment, 
grabbed my Bible and opened to Philippians. Its meaning was finally 
unlocked. I wrote a long article about Philippians for the church newsletter
to share this revelation.

#### For his anger is but for a moment,
##### and his favor is for a lifetime.
#### **Weeping** may tarry for the night,
##### but **joy** comes with the morning.
###### - Psalm 30:5

Solomon said that there is a time to weep and a time to laugh.
It is our folly to think that we can reach the second without
passing through the first.

Every one of God's heavenly treasures poses some obstacle to understanding.
None are easy to acquire, not because God's rules are needlessly difficult, but 
because our hearts are so dark. God does not invite us into his treasury
by making the journey easier. He does it by making our desires stronger.
Pray for a generous heart. Pray for a compassionate heart. Eagerly
desire the heavenly treasures and your passion will drive you forward
and enable you to overcome every obstacle. When your desire for joy
exceeds your fear of sorrow, joy will come to you.
