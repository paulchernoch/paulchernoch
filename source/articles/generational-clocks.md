title: Generational Clocks
quote: The counsel of the Lord stands forever, <br/> the plans of his heart to all generations. <br/> - Psalm 33:11
---
It was while lingering over the chronology in Matthew 1 about a decade ago that the idea popped into my head.
What if God measures time by generations of people, not days and years? From that sprang all the rest.

The five Generational Clocks that I have found are few in number, but they were the starting point. 
Without finding these clocks, I would never proceeded to the others, nor found so much more. 
This article will summarize such clocks.

God can measure time any way He pleases. The insight that led me to the idea of Generational Clocks was that 
people are more important than the sun, moon and stars. Humanity's most accurate clocks are based on the 
radioactive decay of atoms. Before that, we measured time by the reliable motions of the heavenly bodies. 
Because people count, God counts people.

In a Generational Clock, like human generations each tick can be a different span of time.
One generation overlaps the next, so some years may fall during the lives of two people on the clock.
A few of the generations may align with the lives of actual people, like Adam and Methuselah.
The rest are symbolic generations. There might not be an actual person whose life captures the theme
and span of years for that tick of the clock.

For each clock, the following will be given:

  - The name of the clock
  - The chapters from my books that explain the clock in detail
  - Citations of the whole book or select chapters from the Bible that contain the prophecies
  - A table with the generation number, start and end years, Bible verse references and prophetic interpretation
  - Details about the most significant prophecies found in the clock

I scoured the Bible for prophetic clocks. Some sequences of Bible passages that had a few good matches to history I rejected.
Unless every Bible passage (whether chapter, stanza or verse) in the sequence had at least one prophecy that was
fulfilled in the corresponding era, unless every generation between the first and last covered by the clock was represented, I discarded the idea and moved on. If God really intended that book or chapter to be a prophetic clock, it would be perfect.
No eras would be overlooked.

## History of the Idea

My starting point was the genealogy in Matthew 1 which runs from Abraham to Jesus. The logical next step would have been 
to discover *Job's Anti-jubilee Clock*, because that clock also runs from Abraham to Jesus.
However, I was not expecting any Bible passages or whole books to contain chronologically ordered prophecies.
Thus the first structure that I discovered was *The Cosmic Chiasm*, which is a general comparison of the Bible to world history.
From that clock I saw that God had a sequence for which aspects of culture and civilization he would tackle next in His plan
to redeem humanity. That was the key insight that enabled me to understand what God is up to in the story of the seven seals on the 
scroll in Revelation. With each seal that is broken, more than judgment occurs. God is building up a more just world.

In Ecclesiastes I discovered that there were several types of clock. The main one was Solomon's master Celestial clock based on the
twenty-eight times. In a chapter titled "Let's Synchronize our Watches", I resolved the question of how long each generation should be.
*Solomon's Celestial Clock* clearly required 120 years per period, but that didn't line up with *The Cosmic Chiasm*, which seemed to
require a period of 119 years. Two things helped me realize that the clocks needed to have separate but almost equal periods.
First was the story of Noah's Ark. Prior to the flood, God said that He would set a limit of 120 years for human life. That gives us
the 120-year period length. However, the flood ended on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, and **7 x 17 = 119**. In a subtle
way the same story gives us the number 119. Since Psalm 119 is one of my favorites and inspired major features of my novels, 
I turned to that Psalm to see if it had anything prophetic hidden in it. That was how I found *The Shepherd’s Clock*. 
Each stanza of the poem corresponds to one generation of history, with the first matching the time of Adam, the second the time of Methuselah,
and the rest successive 119-year periods.

My thought to search Job for prophetic clocks hinged on four things:

  - I had just written *Job Rises* and was familiar with the material.
  - During that writing, I discovered many prophecies in Job but did not see any order to them, chronological or otherwise.
  - A also discovered in Job eight prophecies (and after the book was finished, a ninth) that pointed to Jesus which were in chronological order.
  - After *Job Rises* was finished, I discovered the Harvest Pattern in Matthew and observed that the Book of Job followed that pattern precisely. So when I discovered the similar Growth Pattern in Ecclesiastes, it was natural to check if Job conformed to that pattern also.

Between three of my books, I would end up finding seven prophetic clocks in Job. However, the fact that the sequence in Matthew's chronology was
from Abraham to Jesus by none of my clocks matched it left me with the feeling that I was missing something.

Another perplexity was about the periods. I found clocks with many different periods. However, there was one period that many other writers on prophecy 
make much of that I did not see: the fifty-year Jubilee.

I can't recall what the final trigger was that caused me to spot *Job's Anti-jubilee Clock*. I do recall one observation that sealed the deal.
Matthew's chronology makes much of the number forty-two, by breaking history into three sets of fourteen names. By showing the number forty-two,
he hid the number fifty. The chronology has fifty names, whether of individuals or collections (like naming someone's brothers as a collection).
If you overlap generations of length fifty by one year, you get forty-nine years. Then if you divide the history from Abraham to a few years after Jesus' resurrection into forty-two segments, forty-nine years is the best fit for a period length.

Lastly, I discovered the *The Acrostic Clock*. I had found a pattern that encompassed half of the Psalms, but when I hit Psalm 112, the prophetic link
was weak. I noticed (as many have before) that Psalms 111 and 112 form a unit. They have the same length in verses and matching verses often use
the same phrases. The themes of the psalms linked up, as the end of Psalm 111 and beginning of Psalm 112 speak of the fear of the Lord.
However, the proper way to interpret these psalms is not by verse, but by poetic line. As the Hebrew scholars have long noted, each phrase begins
with a different Hebrew letter, ordered by the Hebrew alphabet. The psalms are acrostics. 

Each psalm has an introductory "Praise the Lord!" followed by the twenty-two poetic lines. Since I had already found a clock in Psalm 119, another
acrostic psalm, it seemed sensible to search for another clock in Psalm 111 that ran from Creation to Christ. That would leave Psalm 112 to
continue the clock from Christ's First to his Second Coming. Since the two psalms had overlapping themes, it makes sense that they have overlapping
time ranges. The second half clock backs up to the generation before Christ, then proceeds forwards to the end of history.

What is the point of all this rambling? To find these clocks, I had to make numerous connections between Matthew, Genesis, Psalms, Job and Ecclesiastes.
If I did not have ready familiarity with these texts, this would never have happened. The Holy Spirit never said, "Go to Page 200 in your Bible" or some
such thing. If I ever was guided to make a connection, it was the Spirit amplifying memories that were already there. There is no substitute for
years of patient Bible study and reflection.

## Job's Anti-jubilee Clock

  - Bible book: Job
  - Book defined in: *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*
  - Chapters in book that describe it:
    - **Job's Anti-jubilee Clock, Defined**
    - **Prophecies from Abraham to David: Job 1-20**
    - **Prophecies from Solomon to Christ: Job 21-42**
  - Time span: 1952 BC-108 AD
  - Milestones: Abraham to the Apostolic Age
  - Intervals: 42 (one per chapter of Job)
  - Period: 49 (overlapping 50-year jubilees)

The research that went into finding and defining this clock was fun.
It involved spotting and solving an ancient word puzzle.
See a record of that work here:

[Job's Anti-Jubilee Clock, Defined](./job-s-anti-jubilee-clock-defined.html)

Here are some representative prophecies from "Prophecies from Abraham to David: Job 1-20":

<hr/>

### Chapter: 6

  - **Year range**: 1707-1657 BC
  - **Subjects**: Joseph & his brothers
  - **Cross-reference**: Genesis 37, 39-47
  - **Discussion**:

This was an eventful time.

  - 1701 BC. Joseph born when Jacob was 91.
  - 1695-1692 BC. Jacob wrestles with an angel.
  - 1686 BC. Joseph, age 17, sold into slavery by his brothers.
  - 1673 BC. Joseph, age 30, enters Pharaoh's service.
  - 1673-1659 BC. Fourteen years plenty & famine in Egypt.
  - 1662 BC. Jacob enters Egypt at the age of 130.

Parallels between Joseph’s story and Job 6 are obvious.

#### 15 **But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams**, 
##### as the streams that overflow
#### 16 when darkened by thawing ice
##### and swollen with melting snow,
#### 17 **but that stop flowing in the dry season**,
##### and in the heat vanish from their channels.
#### 18 Caravans turn aside from their routes;
##### they go off into the wasteland and perish.
#### 19 The caravans of Tema look for water,
##### the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
#### 20 They are distressed, because they had been confident;
##### they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
#### …
#### 22 Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf,
##### **pay a ransom for me from your wealth**,
#### 23 deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
##### rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?
#### …
#### 27 **You would even cast lots for the fatherless**
##### **and barter away your friend**.
###### - Job 6:15-20,22-23,27

Joseph’s ten brothers (excluding Benjamin) were worse than “undependable”, deciding to
“barter away” their younger brother for cash to satisfy their jealous pride. Joseph longed
for someone to “pay a ransom” for him, but Pharaoh’s cupbearer forgot for years to
reciprocate the blessing that Joseph’s dream brought him. That man deserves Job’s earlier
word:

#### “He who withholds kindness from a friend 
##### forsakes the fear of the Almighty.”
###### - Job 6:14

Even the analogy of streams that *“stop flowing in the dry season”* matches the famine that
plagued the land.

Amid all these trials, Jacob persevered and maintained hope in the dreams that God
gave him as a boy. He retained his morals, as proved when he refused to commit adultery
with Potiphar’s wife and behaved as a model prisoner. Truly, God’s words were as precious
to him as they were to Job:

#### This would be my comfort;
##### I would even exult in pain unsparing,
###### for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
###### - Job 6:10

The previous eras dealt with the challenges of fatherhood, marriage, family relationships,
jealousy and mistreatment at work. Now we have outright betrayal. The turning point in
Joseph’s story is when he forgives his brothers. What of Job?

#### Teach me, and I will be silent;
##### make me understand how I have gone astray. 
###### - Job 6:24

There is no hint of forgiveness in Job 6, only Job’s plea that God teach him where he has
gone wrong. That answer would await the final chapter, Job 42, when God commands Job’s
friends to offer sacrifices of repentance and Job to grant them forgiveness. We have Joseph.
We have Job. Will we wait until the end of our stories to forgive? Here is a prayer to
consider:

#### This very day,
#### Lord, help me be
#### A friend or brother’s
#### Jubilee;
#### Forgiving,
#### Canceling,
#### Setting free,
#### The time and place
#### Are up to me.

### Chapter: 11

  - **Year range**: 1462-1412 BC
  - **Subject**: Moses
  - **Cross-reference**: The Pentateuch
  - **Discussion**:

Chapters 9 and 10 of Job alluded to Moses, the helpless child, and Moses, the fugitive.
With chapter 11, we meet Moses, the prophet. In verse 2, Zophar’s taunt inverts a fantastic
blessing. “Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right?”
No, the multitude of words should not go unanswered, but the proper answer is faith,
obedience and gratitude. While Job by God’s affirmation spoke correctly about God by his
multitude of words, what other man spoke a greater multitude of words of greater weight?
Who but Moses! At least forty human authors penned the Bible, but none wrote more of it
than Moses. Not only can Moses be “judged right”, it is by his words, the commandments
he delivered to us from God, that all mankind shall be judged.

Of what other man besides the Savior can we say this?

#### For you say, **‘My doctrine is pure**,
##### and I am clean in God's eyes.’
#### But oh, that God would speak
##### and open his lips to you,
#### and that he would tell you the **secrets of wisdom**!
##### For he is manifold in understanding.
#### Know then that God exacts of you
##### less than your guilt deserves.
###### - Job 11:4-6

Moses’ words constitute the very definition of what *“doctrine is pure”*. Not only did God
“speak and open his lips to” Moses, he did one better.
*“Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend…”* (Exodus 33:11a)

Now Zophar said one thing with which Job would agree in chapter 28. The path to
wisdom is so long, so high, and so deep that we cannot reach it by our own effort.

#### Can you find out the deep things of God?
##### Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?
#### **It is higher than heaven—what can you do?**
##### **Deeper than Sheol—what can you know?**
#### Its measure is longer than the earth
##### and **broader than the sea**.
###### - Job 11:7-9

Yet what does Moses tell us? God has crossed that infinite gap to give His wisdom to us!

#### For this commandment that I command you today 
#### is not too hard for you, **neither is it far off**. 
#### It is not **in heaven**, that you should say,
##### ‘Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, 
##### that we may hear it and do it?’
#### **Neither is it beyond the sea**, that you should say,
##### ‘Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, 
##### that we may hear it and do it?’ 
#### But **the word is very near you**. It is in your mouth and
#### in your heart, so that you can do it.
#### See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil.
###### - Deuteronomy 30:11-15

Earlier in this book there was talk of summons, by Pharaoh, God or Moses. The
summons were a test of who had authority and who did not. This same question is posed
in Job:

#### If he passes through and imprisons
##### and **summons the court**,
###### **who can turn him back**?
###### - Job 11:10

Pharaoh tried to keep the Hebrew people imprisoned. He failed. 
How did God *“turn him back”* when Pharaoh tried to stop them from leaving? 
He did it by working His wonders, two of which are echoed by Zophar’s words:

#### You will forget your misery;
##### you will remember it as **waters that have passed away**.
#### And your life will be brighter than the noonday;
##### its **darkness will be like the morning**.
###### - Job 11:16-17

The latter reference is to the plague of darkness. The former refers to the parting of the
Red Sea (or less likely the plague of blood on the Nile). The final negative example
summarizes the outcome of all that God did through Moses:

#### But the eyes of the wicked will fail;
##### all **way of escape** will be lost to them,
###### and their hope is to breathe their last.”
###### - Job 11:20, ESV

The sons and daughters of Israel were given an undeserved *“way of escape”*. 
We don’t deserve ours either, but the offer still stands.

### Chapter: 13

  - **Year range**: 1364-1314 BC
  - **Subjects**: Othniel, Judges in General
  - **Cross-reference**: Judges 3:7-11
  - **Discussion**:

In 1358 BC, Joshua died and the era of the judges began. Othniel was the first judge and
served forty years, the majority of this generation. This chapter of Job focuses on one
theme: bringing a court case to God to be judged. The word “case” (as in court case)
appears seven times in Job (in the ESV). The first appearance and greatest number of
appearances fall in this chapter.

During the time of the Judges, God would allow Israel’s enemies to triumph over them
as punishment and discipline for their transgressions. Then he would send a judge to
rescue them. Compare this to Job’s powerful declaration of faith that the one who
chastises him will also rescue him:

#### Though he slay me, I will hope in him;
##### yet I will argue my ways to his face.
#### This will be my salvation,
##### that the godless shall not come before him.
###### - Job 13:15-16

Instead of quoting most of Job chapter 13, here is a word porridge of phrases it includes
related to the majesty of the prosecution of a court case:

#### argument… pleadings… falsely… deceitfully… 
#### show partiality… plead the case… searches… deceive… rebuke…
#### show partiality… majesty… defenses… silence… speak… argue…
#### salvation… declaration… prepared my case…
#### in the right… contend… grant… withdraw…
#### call… answer… speak… reply.
###### - Job 13:6-22

Job even addresses the issue of the injustice of confessions obtained under duress:

#### Only grant me two things,
##### then I will not hide myself from your face:
#### withdraw your hand far from me,
##### and let not dread of you terrify me.
###### - Job 13:20-21

There is no question any longer. The chapters of Job are perfectly attuned to the spiritual
and political situation in Israel. If you feel like you are being judged harshly, turn to Job.

<hr/>

Now here are some representative prophecies from "Prophecies from Solomon to Christ: Job 21-42":

<hr/>

### Chapter: 22

  - **Year range**: 923-873 BC
  - **Subject**: Jeroboam
  - **Cross-reference**: 1 Kings 12, 14
  - **Discussion**:

For his pride, God tore half the kingdom from Rehoboam, son of Solomon. He gave it
to Jeroboam, who ruled over the northern kingdom of Israel from 922-901 BC. However,
because Jeroboam desired power more than obedience to God, the Lord withdrew His
blessing. Thus in 913 BC, he lost the Battle of Mount Zemaraim. The core of his sin was
using religion as a means to maintain control over his people. As if making one golden
calf wasn’t bad enough, he made two!

#### And Jeroboam said in his heart, 
##### “Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David. 
##### If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the 
##### temple of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of 
##### this people will turn again to their lord, to 
##### Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me 
##### and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”
#### **So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold**. 
#### And he said to the people, 
##### “You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. 
##### Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you 
##### up out of the land of Egypt.” 
###### - 1 Kings 12:26-28

The parallel verses in Job are spot on:

#### If you return to the Almighty you will be built up;
##### if you remove injustice far from your tents,
#### if you lay **gold** in the dust,
##### and **gold of Ophir** among the stones of the torrent-bed,
#### **then the Almighty will be your gold**
##### **and your precious silver**.
#### For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty
##### and lift up your face to God.
#### You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you,
##### and you will pay your vows.
#### You will decide on a matter,
##### and it will be established for you,
###### and light will shine on your ways.
###### - Job 22:23-28

Jeroboam did not listen. His god was an idol of gold. His line of kings was not
established and in his kingdom darkness reigned. In 1 Kings 14, the prophet Ahijah told
Jeroboam’s wife that their son would die, even though the boy was good unlike his father.
This is like what was written in Job:

#### But you say, ‘What does God know?
##### Can he judge through the deep darkness?
#### Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see,
##### and **he walks on the vault of heaven**.’
#### Will you keep to the old way
##### that wicked men have trod?
#### **They were snatched away before their time**;
##### **their foundation was washed away**.
###### - Job 22:13-16

Thus the king’s son was snatched away before his time, as judgement from God. These
words would find an opposite fulfillment in the next generation. In those days Elijah
would pierce the clouds and walk on the vaults of heaven, snatched away not for
judgement, but as a reward for faithfulness, on chariots of fire.

### Chapter: 24

  - **Year range**: 825-775 BC
  - **Subjects**: A slave girl, Naaman, Elisha
  - **Cross-reference**: 2 Kings 5
  - **Discussion**:

This chapter of Job is about injustice against the poor. There was no lack of that during
this generation. What is surprising is the grace that a powerful man received courtesy of
his wife’s slave.

#### There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast,
#### and they take a pledge against the poor…
#### Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power;
##### they rise up when they despair of life.
#### He gives them security, and they are supported,
##### and his eyes are upon their ways.
###### - Job 24:9,22-23

In this story, the fatherless child is a Jewish slave girl carried off to Syria by invading
soldiers. The mighty who despaired of life was the enemy general, Naaman. The slave girl
had mercy on her master, giving him advice about whom he could visit who would cure
him of his leprosy.

#### Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, 
#### was a great man with his master and in high favor, 
#### because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria. 
#### He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. 
#### Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off 
#### a little girl from the land of Israel, and she worked 
#### in the service of Naaman's wife. She said to her mistress, 
##### “Would that my lord were with the prophet who is
##### in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.”
###### - 2 Kings 5:1-3

Thanks to the girl, whose name we never learn, Naaman journeys to see the prophet
Elisha and is healed. This is a powerful example of the power of loving your enemy, which
Jesus would one day repeat on a cosmic scale.

Jumping back to Job’s complaint in 24:22-23, I am humbled. Job was confused by God’s
behavior. God seemed to be blessing these mighty but wicked people. When I read these
words years ago, I assumed that Job was missing the big picture. Those wicked people
would eventually get the justice they deserved. It was a matter of seeing God’s eternal plan.
The blessings they received sprang from God patiently deferring his judgement upon them;
their wealth was merely the fruit of their own wickedness left unpunished. Their increase
derived from God being passive, not active. Thanks to the comparison with the story of
Naaman, the full force of Job’s words hit me. God actively arranged for Naaman to be
healed. God does as He teaches: He loves His enemies. Anyone who is not staggered by
this reality like Job was is a fool. It is a glorious but terrifying reality.

This story deserves comparison to the clock’s theme of an anti-jubilee. The jubilee sets
slaves free. Naaman’s compassionate slave girl was not set free. The jubilee restores
property and cancels debts. Assyria, which had captured land and treasure from Israel,
offered to pay Elisha for healing, but he refused payment. The Jubilee year begins with
celebrating the Day of Atonement, a Jewish ritual. In the end, Naaman pleads for Elisha to
pray for God to have mercy on him when he is required to stand beside his king at
Assyria’s pagan temple. This is as anti-jubilee as it gets. God’s ways are beyond our
understanding.

### Chapter: 30

  - **Year range**: 531-481 BC
  - **Subject**: Jerusalem
  - **Cross-reference**: Exilic Psalms, Nehemiah 1
  - **Discussion**:

By the time of this generation, the Babylonian Exile was over, but Jerusalem and Judah
remained in deep distress. Nehemiah would not return to rebuild until the next era, but
the introduction to his book describes the state of affairs at this time.

#### And they said to me,
##### “The remnant there in the province who had survived 
##### the exile is in great trouble and shame. 
##### The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, 
##### and its gates are destroyed by fire.”
##### - Nehemiah 1:3

The breaches in Jerusalem’s walls mirror Job’s analogy for the lack of protection plaguing
him:

#### On my right hand the rabble rise;
##### they push away my feet;
##### they cast up against me their ways of destruction.
#### They break up my path;
##### they promote my calamity;
##### they need no one to help them.
#### **As through a wide breach they come**;
##### amid the crash they roll on.
#### Terrors are turned upon me;
##### my honor is pursued as by the wind,
##### and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
###### - Job 30:12-15

Job in this chapter also makes a musical analogy:

#### My **lyre** is turned to mourning,
##### and my pipe to the voice of those who **weep**.
###### - Job 30:31

By this time, most of the Old Testament had been written. The time of silence between
the Testaments would soon begin, when the tongues of the prophets would be stilled. The
most powerful words of Scripture written in these years were the Exilic Psalms. Among
them, Psalm 137 stands out:

#### By the waters of Babylon,
##### there we sat down and **wept**,
##### when we remembered Zion.
#### On the willows there
##### **we hung up our lyres**.
#### For there our captors
##### required of us songs,
#### and our tormentors, mirth, saying,
##### “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
#### How shall we sing the Lord's song
##### in a foreign land?
#### If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
##### let my right hand forget its skill!
#### Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
##### if I do not remember you,
#### if I do not set Jerusalem
##### above my highest joy!
###### - Psalm 137:1-6

Exiled Jews mourned Jerusalem after it was destroyed. This prophecy in Job shows God’s
deep compassion. The Lord began to mourn and sympathize prophetically with the people
of Jerusalem a millennium earlier. His love endures forever. Though you enter a time of
suffering today, the Lord’s compassion for you began before you were born.

### Chapter: 35

  - **Year range**: 286-236 BC
  - **Subjects**: Eratosthenes, Euclid
  - **Cross-reference**: N/A
  - **Discussion**:

Elihu’s words are lofty:

#### **Look at the heavens, and see**;
##### and behold the clouds, which are higher than you...
#### Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out;
##### they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
#### But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
##### who gives songs in the night,
#### **who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth**
##### **and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?**’
###### - Job 35:5,10-11

As a new Christian, this passage of Job spoke to me more than any other, because I was
once an oppressed person who literally sang songs in the night, seeking relief from despair.
I sang those songs in college, in a place where people study the science of the heavens.

The start of this generation included the final decade of the life of Euclid, the famed
Greek mathematician and teacher. A more fitting example of one prone to 
*“look at the heavens”* was Eratosthenes, chief librarian of Alexandria. He lived from 276-194 BC.
Among his discoveries were a means to measure the circumference of the Earth and its
axial tilt. He created the first global projection of the world. His library was the center of
learning in the ancient world. In those days, God began to divulge to mankind the secrets
of the heavens.

### Chapter: 39

  - **Year range**: 90-40 BC
  - **Subjects**: Rome, Jerusalem
  - **Cross-reference**: Isaiah 11:6, Habakkuk 1:8, Zephaniah 3:3, Ezekiel 22:25-27, Psalm 80:12:13
  - **Discussion**:

The pivotal time for each beastly kingdom in Daniel’s prophecies is when it captures
Jerusalem. This era saw Jerusalem change hands once again, when the Roman general
Pompey besieged the city in 63 BC. The fourth beast in Daniel is called variously terrible
and the legs of iron on a magnificent statue. In other Old Testament prophecies Rome is
also symbolized by wolves, which fits Rome’s own origin myth of its founders, Romulus
and Remus, being suckled by wolves.

The Roman legions marched behind a soldier (called an aquiline) bearing a special
emblem, called a signa militaria. Over the years, the emblem design underwent changes.
The most ancient standard employed by them is said to have been a handful (manipulus)
of straw fixed to the top of a spear or pole. After that, they shifted to various animals,
before Gaius Marius standardized upon the eagle in 104 BC. This means that the eagle
became the primary symbol of Rome less than a score of years before this era began.
According to Pliny the Elder, the full list of animals used as insignia is:

  - eagle (the Aquila)
  - wolf
  - ox with a man's head
  - horse
  - boar

This would be a curiosity if not for the parables found in Job 39 and elsewhere.
Rome is symbolized as:

  - A **wolf** in Isaiah, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and Ezekiel. 
  - The **wild ox** is described in Job 39:9-12. 
  - The **horse** is described in Job 39:19-24.
  - The **boar** only shows up once in the ESV (in Psalm 80), but it looks like it might also describe Rome.
  - The **eagle** appears in Job 39:27-30.

Only a small number of empires ever broke down the walls of Jerusalem, Rome did it
multiple times and its devastation was the worst:

#### Why then have you broken down its walls,
##### so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
#### The **boar** from the forest ravages it,
##### and all that move in the field feed on it.
###### - Psalm 80:12-13

Finally, the last parable in Job 39 is about the **eagle**:

#### Is it at your command that the **eagle** mounts up
##### and **makes his nest on high**?
#### On the rock he dwells and makes his home,
##### on the rocky crag and stronghold.
#### From there he spies out the prey;
##### his eyes behold it from far away.
#### His young ones suck up blood,
##### and where the slain are, there is he.
###### - Job 39:27-30

The eagle nesting on high is Rome occupying Jerusalem. With three of Rome’s five
military logos showing up in one chapter of Job and the other two matching imagery in
other Bible prophecies, it looks like the Bible nailed it. These prophecies were given from
centuries to over a millennia before Rome even existed. God’s foreknowledge is
unassailable.

Of course, the other clock from *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, matching as its 39th era the years 1923-2042 AD,
prophesied an even more astounding eagle-related event. Which eagle made its nest higher
than any other nest in the history of eagle’s nests? That would be the eagle whose
occupants in 1969 said:

**“The eagle has landed.” **

That eagle is the symbol of the new Rome.

### Chapter: 40

  - **Year range**: 41 BC - 10 AD (No year zero!)
  - **Subjects**: Rome, Egypt
  - **Cross-reference**: Daniel 2
  - **Discussion**:

In 44 BC, on my birthday, the Ides of March, Julius Caesar was assassinated. Augustus
Caesar, greatest of Rome’s emperors, succeeded him. This triggered over a decade of civil
wars, ending in 32 BC with the Battle of Actium, whose loss prompted Antony and
Cleopatra to commit suicide. This completed the transformation of the Roman Republic
into the Roman Empire.

The creation of the Roman Empire is memorialized in Job 40 and likened to a
monstrous beast named Behemoth:

#### Behold, Behemoth,
##### which I made as I made you;
##### he eats grass like an **ox**.
#### Behold, his strength in his loins,
##### and his power in the muscles of his belly.
#### He makes his tail stiff like a cedar;
##### the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
#### **His bones are tubes of bronze**,
##### **his limbs like bars of iron**.
#### He is the **first of the works of God**;
##### let him who made him bring near **his sword**!
#### **For the mountains yield food for him**
##### **where all the wild beasts play**.
###### - Job 40:15-20

As noted in the previous section, the ox is one of the five animals used by Rome to
represent their legions. Bronze is associated with Daniel’s third empire, Greece. Rome had
bones of bronze because it adopted much from the Greeks: philosophy, mathematics and
Greek as the trade language of the empire. Daniel’s fourth empire, generally accepted to be
Rome, had legs of iron, matching that analogy. Finally, the place “where all the wild beasts
play” is Egypt. It had previously been conquered by the Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and
now in this era, the Romans. It would later be conquered by Islam. Egypt would become
the breadbasket of the Roman Empire and **“yield food for him”**.

In prophecy, Behemoth shall have two incarnations. The first was Rome and the second
shall be the beast from the sea of Revelation 13. One feature they share in common is a
strong commitment to law and order, ruthlessly applied. Behemoth is therefore lawful evil,
while Leviathan is chaotic evil. The laws of Behemoth may permit much evil and prohibit
much good, but the stability it provides is not entirely devoid of benefits. The Pax Romana
permitted a great expansion in world trade, preserved and advanced Greek philosophy,
mathematics and science, and enriched its upper classes immensely.

Yes, Rome counts as *“first of the works of God”*. No empire comes close to lasting as long as
it did, or having as great an influence upon the entire world. However, this verse applies to
another of God’s works who was begotten in this era, the Incarnate Son of God, Jesus
Christ. These two, Rome and Jesus, belong together. In Job, God said, 
*“Let him who made him bring near his sword!”* Centuries later Jesus said, 
*“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”* (Matthew 10:34) 
When the Roman emperor named Christianity the state religion in 380 AD via the Edict of Thessalonica,
Rome became Christ’s sword, wielded by his church to spread the gospel.

### Chapter: 41

Of all the prophecies in this generational clock, the most detailed and profound is contained in Job chapter 41.
It prophesies the suffering and crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ and the establishment of a new covenant.
It does this through negative philosophy, telling us all the good things that an evil sea serpent WILL NOT do for us.
Those are the very things that are Lord DID do for us.
This prophecy is described in the following article on this website:

[The Journey Pattern](./the-journey-pattern.md)

That is all for Job's Anti-Jubilee Clock. It ended with the greatest Jubilee, the coming of Christ who forgives all out debts.

You may be tempted to think that I cherry-picked the best prophecies to show here
and that the ones I did not show are vague and weakly supported. No, I selected the prophecies from these chapters because 
they were the shortest!
