To recap, the seven spirits of God are named in Isaiah:

#### And the Spirit of (1) **the Lord** shall rest upon him,
#### the Spirit of (2) **wisdom** and 
#### (3) **understanding**,
#### the Spirit of (4) **counsel** and 
#### (5) might,
#### the Spirit of (6) **knowledge** and 
#### (7) **the fear of the Lord**.
###### - Isaiah 11:2

Each of the Bible books that constitute the Seven Pillars of Wisdom exemplifies one of these spirits, though all seven appear in each.

## Spirits

The tables and analysis for the preceding clues already
connected many passages to the seven spirits. Here are a
few more. These points solidify why each of the seven
books that constitute the Seven Pillars of Wisdom is tied
most closely to one of the spirits.

## The Spirit of Lordship: Psalms

“The Lord” shows up in the Psalms 717 times, the most of any book in the Bible.
Of the Psalms, it appears most often – twenty-four times – in
Psalm 119, which prophesied the coming of the Lord.

## The Spirit of Wisdom: Job

The climax of Job’s final
speech is chapter 28. It is a mysterious hymn to wisdom.
Since Solomon said that the heart of the Wise is in the
House of Mourning, that makes Job, the book of mourning,
the place where that heart beats strongest.

## The Spirit of Understanding: Proverbs

Forty-three occurrences of the word **understanding** appear in Proverbs,
the most of any book. Proverbs 8 demonstrates that
understanding by listing the attributes of all seven spirits:

#### “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
##### and I find **knowledge** and discretion.
#### The **fear of the LORD** is hatred of evil.
#### Pride and arrogance and the way of evil
##### and perverted speech I hate.
#### I have **counsel** and sound **wisdom**;
#### I have **insight (aka understanding)**; I have **strength**.
#### By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;
##### by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly.
#### I love those who love me,
##### and those who seek me diligently find me.
#### Riches and honor are with me,
##### enduring wealth and righteousness.
#### My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold,
##### and my yield than choice silver.
#### I walk in the way of righteousness,
##### in the paths of justice,
#### granting an inheritance to those who love me,
##### and filling their treasuries.
#### **“The LORD** possessed me at the beginning of his work,
##### the first of his acts of old."
###### - Proverbs 8:12-22

## The Spirit of Counsel: Song of Songs

The most occurrences of counsel are found in Isaiah, eighteen in all.
Isaiah is the prophet who lists the seven spirits of God in
canonical order. Song of Songs has five "adjure" statements:
2:7; 3:5; 5:8,9; 8:4. The book counsels people to learn by
patience God’s timing for how to best approach life. Song of
Songs speaks to the heart and the emotions.

## The Spirit of Might: Ecclesiastes

This book is about action, about planning and doing. Ecclesiastes 9:10,16 are
about might and fall at the defining part of the book.

#### “Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your **might**, for
#### there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol,
#### to which you are going… But I say that 
#### **wisdom is better than might**, though the poor man's wisdom 
#### is despised and his words are not heard.“ 

(Note again the pairing of knowledge and wisdom!)

## The Spirit of Knowledge: Matthew

As Colossians 2:3 says, in Jesus are found all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge. In many (but not all) of the passages in the
Bible where the seven spirits are given in order
schematically, two spirits are emphasized by having the
word gold appear in their passages (or some other
distinguishing phrase). Those two spirits are **wisdom** and
**knowledge**. Wisdom is borne from suffering, matching
Christ’s first coming, while knowledge is the hallmark of the
final harvest, Christ’s second coming.

#### The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 
##### ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, 
##### a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ 
#### Yet **wisdom** is justified by her **deeds**.
###### - Matthew 11:19 ESV

#### The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this
#### generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth
#### to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than
#### Solomon is here.
###### Matthew 12:42 ESV

#### And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from
#### there, and coming to his hometown he taught them in their
#### synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, 
##### “Where did this man get this **wisdom** and these **mighty works**?"
###### - Matthew 13:53-54 ESV

#### Now we know that **you know all things** and do not need anyone to
#### question you; this is why we believe that you came from God.
###### - John 16:30 ESV

Matthew is about Jesus and Jesus knows all things. QED.

## The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord: Revelation

The final book of the Bible does not speak of the fear the Lord
as often as Psalms, Proverbs or the prophets. It just causes
it. After I left the Catholic church, reading this book was the
first step on my journey back to God, and it terrified me. It
did its job well.
