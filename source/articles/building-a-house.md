title: Building a House
quote: If the serpent bites before it is charmed, <br/> there is no advantage to the charmer. <br/> - Ecclesiastes 10:11

How many times can a person read Ecclesiastes 10 and not notice what metaphor the author is using?
In my case, many! The following passage has two riddles:

  - The easy riddle of what metaphor ties all the parables together
  - The difficult riddle of what that metaphor prophesies

For decades I could not even solve the easy riddle. Perhaps you can. Here are the verses.
What is the author talking about?

#### <sup>5</sup> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, 
#### as it were an error proceeding from the ruler: 
#### <sup>6</sup> folly is set in many high places, and the rich 
#### sit in a low place. <sup>7</sup> I have seen slaves on horses, 
##### and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
#### <sup>8</sup> He who digs a pit will fall into it,
##### and a serpent will bite him who breaks through a wall.
#### <sup>9</sup> He who quarries stones is hurt by them,
##### and he who splits logs is endangered by them.
#### <sup>10</sup> If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge,
##### he must use more strength,
###### but wisdom helps one to succeed.
#### <sup>11</sup> If the serpent bites before it is charmed,
##### there is no advantage to the charmer.
#### <sup>12</sup> The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor,
##### but the lips of a fool consume him.
#### <sup>13</sup> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,
##### and the end of his talk is evil madness.
#### <sup>14</sup> A fool multiplies words,
##### though no man knows what is to be,
###### and who can tell him what will be after him?
#### <sup>15</sup> The toil of a fool wearies him,
##### for he does not know the way to the city.
#### <sup>16</sup> Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
##### and your princes feast in the morning!
#### <sup>17</sup> Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility,
##### and your princes feast at the proper time,
###### for strength, and not for drunkenness!
#### <sup>18</sup> Through sloth the roof sinks in,
##### and through indolence the house leaks.
#### <sup>19</sup> Bread is made for laughter,
##### and wine gladdens life,
###### and money answers everything.
#### <sup>20</sup> Even in your thoughts, do not curse the king,
##### nor in your bedroom curse the rich,
#### for a bird of the air will carry your voice,
##### or some winged creature tell the matter.

The focus of this website is the architecture of Lady Wisdom's House.
This riddle is not about her house. It is about ours.
The central metaphor, if you have not figured it out yet, is the building of a house.
It follows the whole process, from digging a hole for the the foundation to hammering down the roof.
Each building activity is a separate parable and each parable a prophecy. 
Together they combine to describe the building of a new civilization: our civilization.

The Book of Ecclesiastes gives us a view of life in which our years may be divided into three parts:

  - Ascending Years (birth to maturity, in twenty-eight times, up to age 49)
  - Productive years (age 50-61)
  - Declining Years (62+)

Solomon devotes most of the book to the first part of life, the ascending years.
The productive years are covered in chapter 10 and the start of chapter 11.
How interesting this warning is for Americans:

#### So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; 
#### but let him remember that **the days of darkness will be many**. 
#### All that comes is vanity.
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:8

When financial catastrophe strikes an American, they may have to file for bankruptcy.
We call that "Filing for Chapter 11" by reference to a section of our legal code. 
That is a "day of darkness" indeed, and often spells the beginning of a person's
declining years. This article is not about that. It is about the part of the productive years
described in chapter 10. The ideas were originally presented in a short section of the 
chapter named "A Grandfather Clock & a Silver Cord" from *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
