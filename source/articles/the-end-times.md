## Time is Essential to Wisdom

#### “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,
##### and the heavens are the work of your hands;
#### they will perish, but you remain;
##### they will all wear out like a garment,
#### like a robe you will roll them up,
##### like a garment they will be changed.
#### But you are the same,
##### and your years will have no end.”
###### - Hebrews 1:10-12

Who does not approach the prospect of the world's end with ambivalence?
The topic is dreary. Even so, post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows abound. The news is filled with warnings about
climate change causing the seas to rise and deserts to spread. Strangely, these voices
all take the wrong tack. They try to scare people with warnings in order to promote changes that will avert the end.
Theirs is really a voice proclaiming a path to an endless future. That path is an illusion.

It is impossible for Christians to dodge the subject. The Bible devotes many words to the last days.
We just don't understand them. One thing is clear: Christians expect it to be a happy ending - if you believe in Jesus.
The end is set in stone by God and inescapable. Perhaps we may earn a reprieve, like when the shadow went back ten steps for King Hezekiah (2 Kings 20), 
but that will only delay the end a short while.

This explains why Christians must face the end, but why dilute a website on spiritual growth with musings about the apocalypse?
The answer lies in Ecclesiastes. Solomon's opening chapter speaks of the many cycles of God's creation, natural and human.
Then in the third chapter, he zooms in on the human cycles of life in the poem of the twenty-eight times.
After revealing a little, Solomon tells us what we do not know:

#### He has made everything beautiful in its time. 
#### Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, 
#### yet so that he cannot find out what God has done 
#### from the beginning to the end.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:11

We do not know the works of God from beginning to end. We have forgotten most of what came before and cannot see what lies ahead.
Isaiah tells us what this means:

#### Remember this and stand firm,
##### recall it to mind, you transgressors,
##### remember the former things of old;
#### for I am God, and there is no other;
##### I am God, and there is none like me,
#### **declaring the end from the beginning**
##### **and from ancient times things not yet done**,
#### saying,
##### ‘My counsel shall stand,
##### and I will accomplish all my purpose...’
###### - Isaiah 46:8-10

This knowledge of past and future is one of the essential, distinguishing marks of God.
It lies at the core of God's wisdom. In Proverbs, this is what Lady Wisdom has to say for herself:

#### The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work,
##### the first of his acts of old.
#### Ages ago I was set up,
##### at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
###### - Proverbs 8:22-23

In place of "possessed", some use fathered or created. This tells us that an essential characteristic of wisdom
is that nothing precedes it, save God himself. It arrived first in time so can comprehend all time.

No account that seeks to explore wisdom can avoid time.

No account that seeks to explore time can avoid thetime of the end.

## My Struggles with Time

Before proceeding, I will share the progression of my attitude towards the issue of the End Times over the course of my life.
The reason is that there are many motives for seeking this knowledge and not all lead to the truth.
As a teen, I was fascinated by time. I loved time travel stories and fantasy stories with prophecies of the future.
Isaac Asimov's idea of using mathematics to predict the future as explored in his Foundation series gripped me.
Alexis de Tocqueville's book *Democracy in America* astonished me. Around 1840, he predicted that the two great world powers
in the twentieth century would be the United States and Russia. How I longed to understand history and politics so well
that I could have such a keen vision of things. 

In progress...
