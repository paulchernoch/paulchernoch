title: The End Times
---
#### “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,
##### and the heavens are the work of your hands;
#### they will perish, but you remain;
##### they will all wear out like a garment,
#### like a robe you will roll them up,
##### like a garment they will be changed.
#### But you are the same,
##### and your years will have no end.”
###### - Hebrews 1:10-12

Who does not approach the prospect of the world's end with ambivalence?
The topic is dreary. Even so, post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows abound. The news is filled with warnings about
climate change causing the seas to rise and deserts to spread. Strangely, these voices
all take the wrong tack. They try to scare people with warnings in order to promote changes that will avert the end.
Theirs is really a voice proclaiming a path to an endless future.

It is impossible for Christians to dodge the subject. The Bible devotes many words to this topic.
We just don't understand them. One thing is clear: Christians believe that it will be a happy ending - if you believe in Jesus.
The end is set in stone by God and inescapable. Perhaps we may earn a reprieve, like Habakkuk, but that will only
delay the end a short while.

Before proceeding, I will share the progression of my attitude towards the issue of the End Times over the course of my life.
The reason is that there are many motives for seeking this knowledge and not all lead to the truth.

In progress...
