<div class="sections">

<p>The whole of my book <em>Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace</em> is concerned with exploring the place of the Ten Commandments 
in the structures of God's wisdom. Parts of that analysis may be found in the Spiritual Growth section of this website:</p>

This article will speak about the commandments more broadly. It will point out that every discussion of God's
plans for us must begin with those commandments. By those commandments God will not only judge the unsaved world, 
He will also judge His church. Did I say will? No, that is wrong. The judgement has already begun...

## A Confession

I did not want to write this article. Many worthy people have presented vivid and actionable teachings on the Decalogue.
I wrote a whole book on the subject and do not want to rehash those ideas here. Yet no edifice of knowledge can be understood without an account
of its foundation. If I can't cover everything, I must at least say something. That something had better motivate readers to carry on
their own study. Therefore this article will touch on two points: **wrath** and **protection**.

**Wrath**. The wrath of God terrifies and demoralizes the enemies of God (as it should), but when accompanied by faith, produces in the believer 
first repentance and second courage. Thus I will show you the wrath of God at work so that the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord may visit you.
His wrath is not a chaotic, haphazard affair. God channels it into deliberate and measured actions executed at regular interludes that precisely 
conform to the Ten Commandments in flavor. When you see that, you will know that your life is in the hands of an impartial judge who is not
asleep at the wheel. May this wake you up and challenge you to follow the Lord more closely.

**Protection**. It would be easy to write an essay that catalogues the myriad ways that people cheerfully violate the commandments, 
sometimes without knowing it. There are endless tracts about that to scold you. What we need as much as insight into our sin is insight into God's love. 
Paul the Apostle said in 1 Corinthians 13:7 that *love always protects*. Each commandment of God protects something worth protecting.
Jesus said that we are to store up treasure in Heaven. Those treasures need to be protected. The Ten Commandments are the walls of the
vault that protects those treasures - all of them. I will put some of those treasures on display and explain which commandment protects 
each of them. Once you see the protection of God, you see the love of God. When the Law of God becomes a Law of Love that law becomes glorious.

## The Law is Important

The Law is the foundation of Lady Wisdom's house. In the Bible, that law is symbolized
by a precious stone. Depending on your translation, that stone is either lapis lazuli or sapphire.
When Isaiah promised to Jerusalem that God would rebuild her on a foundation of lapis lazuli,
he meant that he would rebuild her by restoring in her the sacred place of the Law, the only true
foundation of a just and secure civilization. Tradition holds that the original stone tablets that Moses
carried down from Mount Sinai were carved by the finger of God upon lapis lazuli. A more certain reference
may be found in Exodus 24, which describes an event that occurred just before Moses ascended Sinai to get the tablets:

#### Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel 
#### went up and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like 
#### a pavement made of **lapis lazuli**, as bright blue as the sky.
###### - Moses 24:9-10 (NIV)

If something is solid enough for the God of the universe to walk on, it is solid enough to be a foundation for us.

In Ezekiel 1:26 and 10:1, the prophet beheld a vision of God's throne and said that it looked like lapis lazuli.
If a material is majestic enough to be used to construct God's throne, it is majestic enough for us to sit on.

The Ten Commandments (and the rest of the Law that came with it) are that foundation and that throne.
Here are a few ways in which the Ten Commandments are woven into Scripture that speak to its magnificence:

  - Hannah, mother of the Prophet Samuel, shaped her ten-verse prophetic prayer according to the commandments, as explored in [Hannah's Song](./hannah-s-song.html)
  - The Apostle Paul, when writing to Timothy, prophetically structured the ten chapters of those two letters according to the commandments, as shown in  [Reconciliation](./reconciliation.html)
  - Other Prophetic clocks structured according to the Ten Commandments are identified in [Commandment Clocks](./commandment-clocks.html)
  - The Gospel of Matthew is structured according to the Ten Commandments when broken into fourteen imperative statements: [Matthew and the Law of Christ](./matthew-and-the-law-of-christ.html")
  - Psalm 119, longest of the Psalms, extols the value of meditating on God's Law in almost every verse
  - Job has prophecies of how God judges empires across all of human history in an order governed by the Ten Commandments, as shown in [Job: The Course of Empires](./job-course-of-empires.html) and [The Meaning of the Beasts of Job](./the-meaning-of-the-beasts-of-job.html)

Hannah's prayer is significant. She gives seven examples of people whose fortunes were reversed. 
Those seven reversals conform to both the Growth and Harvest Patterns. Wrapped around the seven reversals are 
additional verses that bring the total to ten and match the Ten Commandments. In two key places, there are references
to the number seven and the pillars of the earth, thus prophesying the existence of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
By these stylistic flourishes we are taught that the commandments are the basis of all short term spiritual harvests 
and long term spiritual growth and provide the matrix for all of God's wisdom.

Job's prophecies are also significant. They prove that God has been steadily judging major world empires over the course 
of thousands of years. Each act of judgment is for the violation of one of the commandments and the judgments are proceeding in order.
Nine of those judgments have been completed, meaning only one remains before Christ returns. The judged and fallen empires are:

  - Babel - for worshiping human progress, not God
  - Egypt - for idolatry
  - Israel - for taking the Lord's name in vain
  - Assyria - for violating the sabbath
  - Babylon - for failure to honor parents
  - Persia - for murder (thirteen Assyrian kings murdered, one executed, many royal family members assassinated and Haman's genocide of the Jews initially condoned)
  - Greece - for adultery
  - Rome - for theft (including European colonialism)
  - Islam - for bearing false witness (denying that God has a Son)

Stepping back, we can list other times (also elaborated upon in my book) where God employed the schema of the Ten Commandments 
(sometimes supported by metaphorical echoes of the ten plagues on Egypt) to judge political and religious entities:

  - Each of the first ten generations of humans (on Cain's side) broke a commandment, in canonical sequence, prompting the flood
  - Each of the first ten chapters of Genesis gave an example of breaking a commandment, in canonical sequence, prompting the fall of Babel
  - Eqypt endured ten plagues, most of which match the corresponding commandment, such as the seventh plague of hail stones matching the seventh commandment against adultery, whose ancient punishment was stoning
  - Israel was judged (or on occasion blessed and her enemies judged) for violations of each commandment. For Judah, the tenth plague on the firstborn was the death of Christ, the firstborn over all creation, at the hands of those who coveted his power
  - Christian Civilization as a whole was judged according to the commandments, with the sixth plague of boils being recapitulated as the Black Death, which had boils as a symptom. This was in punishment of the church's growing violence (crusades, inquisition, etc).

While writing this article, I discovered another instance where history tracks the commandments, as God has exercised judgment upon my own 
beloved Protestant Church. 

## No Person, Nation or Religion is Exempt

God judged Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Rome. He judged Israel and Judah. He will one day judge the whole earth. Before then, Christians must face the 
sobering fact that God also judges the church. The Lord is an impartial judge.

When I became a Baptist, there remained a trace among my new co-religionists of the virulent anti-Catholic bigotry that once gripped all 
of Protestantism. Many reformers, theologians, pastors and lay people denounced the Roman Catholic Church, associated it with the harlot of Revelation, 
and gleefully prophesied its eventual destruction by God. When I found my first Commandment Clock, it spanned the whole of the church age from 
the time of Christ's birth until his return. Signature acts of judgment against the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches were easy to fit into that outline
of history. They are real - but the ease with which I found that clock shows my bias. Over a year has passed since I found the other commandment clocks.
Only now have I found one that speaks of God's wrath against the Protestant Church for breaking the commandments - or in some instances, keeping them.
Pride is worst in those who have been elevated to the highest office. Being persuaded that Protestant theology is closer to the truth than the 
alternatives, it follows that the worst pride imaginable could only emanate from Protestant sources.

The obvious choice of year to start this clock would be 1517 AD, when Luther published his ninety-five theses. Instead, I chose 1450 AD because of
its proximity to another church shattering event, the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD.

To discover and demonstrate a prophetic clock based on the Ten Commandments, you need to choose a corporate entity (a nation, civilization or religion),
pick a start year and and end year, divide the era in ten equal parts, then match events in each historical era to the corresponding commandment.
In many of the prophetic clocks covered in my books or on this website, there are in the Bible text riddles that spell out the start event and period
in years for the clock. I have not found such riddles for this one. Furthermore, there were several possible start years. I settled on the start year 
numbered below (1450 AD) by trail and error; it was not the most obvious yet possessed the best match to history. Using as the end year 2280 AD
(consistent with many other of the clocks) you arrive at a period of 83 years for each commandment.

The following clock is still ticking. Three acts of judgment remain. I will not speculate what those events might be, because 
if the church repents, the judgment will rebound against her enemies. Here is how things have gone so far...

### 1450 - 1533 AD: One God for One Church

The First Commandment calls on people to worship one God. If we were united in true worship of the one true God, our church
would be united as well. The sign of our failing to keep this command was the tearing of Christendom into pieces.
In 1453 AD, Constantinople fell and millions of Eastern Orthodox believers died, were enslaved or forced to convert to Islam.
The next shattering event was the Protestant Reformation which began in 1517 AD, incited by Martin Luther. The lack of unity
that Christians were hiding inside now manifested itself for the world to see.

### 1533 - 1616 AD: Idols of Silver and Gold

The Second Commandment against idolatry is one that the church violated with gusto. This era saw the rapid conquest of the 
Americas by Spain, Portugal, England, the Netherlands and the other European colonial empires.
In 1532, a year before this era began, Francisco Pizarro conquered the Incan Empire. The 1530's and 1540's would then become the peak decades
for extracting silver and gold from the New World. The Spaniards and others hauled vast treasures of silver, gold, iron, animal pelts, 
and new foods from the New World. In their place they left disease, slavery and death. On the one hand, those empires were exacting God's 
vengeance against pagan nations. On the other hand, by letting those treasures become idols in their hearts, they stored up God's wrath 
against themselves. The Wars of Religion and other conflicts that sprang from the Reformation killed tens of millions in Europe and spilled over into the Americas as well. God detests idols.

### 1616 - 1699 AD: The Name of a New Lord

The Third Commandment tells us that we are not to take the name of the Lord in vain. That means we are not to arrogate His authority 
to serve our own ends by making false prophecies or abusing religious authority in other ways. Worse than this is to make 
God's Name - His Word - of no effect by denying its divine origin, truthfulness, power and authority over our lives. 
In this era, the philosophers of the Age of Reason lay siege to the underpinnings of philosophy and set up human reason as the new God.
They took up arms against the faith that in the 1616, the first year of this era, placed Nicolaus Copernicus' 
*De revolutionibus orbium coelestium* (1543) on the *Index Librorum Prohibitorum*, forbiding the faithful to read it.
Spinoza denied that the Bible was of divine origin.  Hobbes in his book *Leviathan* called for the establishment of authoritarian 
forms of government, laying the groundwork for the totalitarian regimes to follow. Descartes ripped empirical knowledge and divine ends 
from his philosophy. The Lord of these new thinkers was Rationalism, not Jesus Christ. The punishment for these crimes was that we must 
live under the systems that they created.

### 1699 - 1782 AD: A Delightful Sabbath Rest

The Fourth Commandment to rest on the seventh day needed no marketing team in this era. Exhausted, terrified by agitators predicting 
the end of the world and by the memory of the wars that had so recently savaged the continent, many felt desolate. Thus the faithful 
of this era turned to God for rest. They kept the sabbath by turning to the Lord in repentance, prayer, and quiet reflection.
The Pietism Movement in Europe lasted from 1675 to 1740. One artifact of this movement was the *Geistreiches Gesangbuch*, a hymnal
assembled by Johan Anastasius Freylinghausen and first published in 1704 AD.
Pietism was followed by the Methodist Revival in England (1738 and after) and the 
Great Awakening in America (1730's - 1760's). Then in 1781 AD, America won a decisive victory over
Great Britain at Yorktown. It would soon become a place of rest for refugees from all over the world.

### 1782 - 1865 AD: The land the Lord your God is giving you.

The Fifth Commandment teaches us that if we honor our father and mother, 
"*that \[our\] days \[will\] be long in the land that the Lord \[our\] God is giving \[us\].*"
The land that was given was America. By the millions people began to flock to the city shining on a hill.
Refugees from oppression, famine and poverty found a place where they could live in hope.

### 1865 - 1948 AD: Thou Shalt not Commit Genocide

The Sixth Commandment forbids murder. In this era, monstrous crimes against humanity were committed, many by Christian nations.
The era begins with the final year of the American Civil War, God's judgment for tolerating slavery.
In the succeeding years we have these genocidal atrocities:

  - United Kingdom and Australia against the Aborigines (over 270 massacres over 140 years)
  - United State policies toward its indigenous peoples (wars, forced marches, and reservations)
  - Belgium against the peoples of the Congo (1885 - 1908)
  - Germany against the Namibians (1904 - 1907)
  - the Ottomans against the Armenians (1915 - 1916)
  - the Soviet Union's Holodomor against the Ukraine (1932 - 1933)
  - the Japanese Rape of Nanjing (1937)
  - the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews (1941 - 1945)
  - and so many more that I have not the heart to keep listing

God's judgment against the Christian empires and nations was exacted through the two World Wars, Influenza epidemic 
and the oppression of Communism. Millions died. Empires were dissolved. Territories were stripped away. Then in the last year of this era, 
the world became ashamed. First, Israel became a sovereign nation once again. 
Second, *The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* was adopted 
by the United Nations on December 9, 1948. Sadly, this did little to stop Rwanda, East Timor, South Sudan, Darfur, Viet Nam,
Cambodia, and all the rest.

### 1948 - 2031 AD: Glorying in the Shame of Adultery

The Seventh Commandment forbids adultery. This is our era and we lost no time justifying our debauchery.
In 1948, the first year of this era, Kinsey published his first report, on male sexuality, to be followed a few years later by another on women's.
The subsequent sexual revolution of the 1960's shredded all cultural norms and protections. The moral insanity that this unleashed
continues to grow and fester every year with no end in sight. Early on it took a disease like AIDS to exact a physical toll
against the immoral. Now children willingly submit their bodies to be mangled and their future happiness to be pushed beyond reach.
These sins thus deliver self-inflicted judgment. When will people come to their senses?

### 2031 - 2114 AD: Against Theft

The Eighth Commandment forbids theft. I do not know what God will do to judge the church for this sin, but 
stripping us of our wealth seems likely. We seem to be headed for a time of great persecution against Christians.
The world covets money. If they get the chance, they will take and take and take until there is nothing left.

### 2114 - 2197 AD: Against Lying

The Ninth Commandment forbids lying. There are many ways to punish a person for lying but the worst is to take away the truth.
The truth of Jesus Christ can save you. It is one thing to be offered this truth and reject it. What happens when it is nowhere 
to be found? What happens when you know you are dying and you run from door to door and absolutely nobody knows the way of salvation?

### 2197 - 2280 AD: Against Coveting

The Tenth Commandment forbids coveting. The surest way to torment the covetous is enable them to acquire the things that they covet,
only to have those things poison and destroy them.

### There is Hope

All those judgments were designed by God to correct and purify the church, to call her to leave this wicked world and its entanglements.
They were not designed to destroy us. In every era, there have been some who heed the warnings and turn away from evil and to God.

The history and prophecy related to God's judgment of empires is meant to do more that intrigue and entertain, 
it is intended to show that God takes His commandments seriously. He pours His power into upholding them. He shapes the history
of civilizations by them and also the course of human lives, through the Growth and Harvest Patterns that structure all our days.
We must look at the commandments seriously. They were given so that we might become free and remain free, not live as slaves.

## What lies beneath the Law? Love!

If the commandments are the foundation of Lady Wisdom's house, it seems foolish to ask what sits under them. 
What could possibly be under the bottom? The question makes better sense if we ask what comes not under but before the Law. 
Why was the Law established? What was God's purpose in giving it?

About two decades ago, I wrote some fantasy novels set in the afterlife in a city called the Courtlands, a sort of purgatory.
While world building for those novels, I realized that I needed to design a court system to process all the dead people and decide 
where to send them. Not being a lawyer, I cast about for where to begin. I still remember my thought process. 
I came up with a chain of questions that led me to my answer.

<br/> **Q:** What is the purpose of the law? <br/>
**A:** To uphold a moral code.

<br/> **Q:** What is the purpose of a moral code? <br/>
**A:** To defend what is valuable.

<br/> **Q:** What is valuable? <br/>
**A:** The heavenly treasures that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 6.

<br/> **Q:** And what are those heavenly treasures?

I spent years searching my heart and the Scriptures to make up a list of those treasures. I wrote *The Endless Hunt* 
to share my findings. My methodology was to find places in the Bible where Jesus, a prophet or apostle used language to
strongly emphasize the importance of some quality, value or behavior. I whittled the results down to a list of ten, then found
two more to make a total of twelve. These spiritual values can be grouped into four larger themes:

  - **identifying** (*our being*: The Fear of the Lord, Eternal Life, The Glory of God)
  - **establishing** (*our relationships*: authority, work & rest, family)
  - **nurturing** (*our expression*: love, courage & protection, wisdom & justice & truth)
  - **flourishing** (*our fulness*: happiness & generosity, freedom, peace & joy)

All that effort was expended to look afar, find the treasures, bring them close and then try via induction to wrestle them into 
a framework so that I could grasp them. It is likely that I missed some treasures, so having broad categories is useful.
It helps me bridge the gap with some catchalls, the unknown things that establish and nurture us and enable us to flourish.
Once I had my list, I could design an abstract yet coherent legal system to defend them.
This effort was fruitful because it disclosed to me what the most important of the treasures is: the Glory of God.
That prompted me to undertake a three-year long fast in search of God's glory.

The astute will say that if I had only trusted the traditions of the church, like the Shorter Westminster Catechism, it would 
have saved me time and trouble:

  - Q. What is the chief end of man?
  - A. Man’s chief end is to **glorify God**, and to enjoy him forever.

My answer is that sometimes you have to do the work yourself. With the "Greatest Commandment", the "Golden Rule", "the most excellent way"
and myriad other superlative statements circulating the church, climbing to the top of that mountain was arduous. However, from the mountain top it 
is easy to see down. Having found these treasures scattered throughout the Bible it is possible now to see how all of them can be 
defended by one compact set of laws, the Ten Commandments. Had I started years ago by going in the other direction, from commandment to treasure trove,
I would have come up short. You need to understand the commandments very well before you can see all that they protect. That I could not do.
Now I am learning how. Here then are a few ideas about what treasures each commandment protects.

## I. A God of Freedom



## II. The Fear of the Lord, Courage & Spiritual Treasure



## III. Authority & Forgiveness



## IV. Wisdom, Purpose, Significance, Joy & Peace



## V. Family


## VI. Life & Protection


## VII. Loyalty


## VIII. Generosity


## IX. Truth & Justice


## X. Happiness & Contentment



##  The Glory of God
