title: The Growth Pattern of Solomon
quote: To everything there is a season, <br/> A time for every purpose under heaven... <br/> - Ecclesiastes 3:1
---

#### For everything there is a season, 
#### and a time for every matter under heaven:
##### a time to be born, and a time to die;
##### a time to plant, 
###### and a time to pluck up what is planted;
##### a time to kill, and a time to heal;
##### a time to break down, and a time to build up;
##### a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
##### a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
##### a time to cast away stones, 
###### and a time to gather stones together;
##### a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
##### a time to seek, and a time to lose;
##### a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
##### a time to tear, and a time to sew;
##### a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
##### a time to love, and a time to hate;
##### a time for war, and a time for peace.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

The scent of destiny wafts from Solomon's poetic phrasing. Cycle after cycle, fortune's reversals 
beat like a drum, lingering over hatred and war before ushering in the hoped for age of peace.
In 1959, Pete Seeger wrote the pop song "Turn, Turn, Turn", adorning and slightly reordering the words
from Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. The song was first released on vinyl in 1962 by the Limeliters, 
to be followed months later by Pete Seeger himself. However, the best known version that climbed the charts was
performed by the Byrds in 1965.

Why dredge up a lesson in pop history? First, I was born in 1962, the year the song was first recorded. 
Second, the ability to decode the meaning of this passage and discover its echoes elsewhere in the Bible is
the greatest gift that God has ever given me. It forms a large part of the answer to the burning question I
asked over thirty years ago. Christianity has so many ideas, doctrines, and rules that I could not wrap my
head around it all. I wanted a simpler way. I wanted to know the most important truths of the faith and
how they fit together so that I could use that as a framework for adding in all the rest. I needed a way
to manage the complexity. With the Harvest and Growth Patterns and the larger structure of Lady Wisdom's House,
I found that, but the Growth Pattern is the crucial one.

## What is the Growth Pattern for? 

First, it is a developmental model for the growth of a human being from birth to full maturity. 
It divides life into seven phases, each seven years in duration. The pattern governs the principal human needs
to be met or challenges to be faced in each period. It explains the rhythm of life "under the sun".
It is entirely materialistic.

Second, the pattern is a discipleship model for Christians to bring them from spiritual infancy to full maturity 
in the faith. Each materialistic phase has a spiritual analog. I saw this dimly as I wrote my recent books. 
Christians will not progress evenly through the phases; they do not last a set amount of time.
This article will report on a discovery I made after writing those books. The first seven of Paul's letters,
Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, match the seven key phases of the 
Growth Pattern, in order. Each book has wise counsel on how to progress through its corresponding phase.

Third, the pattern is the mainspring for God's prophetic clocks. The poem serves as a parable for all of history,
or for shorter stretches of history; it applies at several scales. Thus one scale spans the whole of history
from the Creation to the second coming of Christ. A shorter scale starts with the dedication of Solomon's Temple.
An even shorter scale begins at Pentecost, with the establishment of the Church. The shortest I have found runs
from the Holocaust until the end; it prophesies the future of the modern nation of Israel.
The prophetic implications of this pattern will be discussed in a separate section of this website.

I discovered and documented the Growth Pattern while writing *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and made some 
elaborations to it in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. The next part of this article is adapted from
the chapter "There is a Season" in the former book. The concluding section of this article will explore new ground.
It will show how Paul's first seven letters, in the order found in your Bible, appear to have been divinely ordered
so as to teach a discipleship course. They proceed from teaching the new Christian the essential truth
of our eternal security in Christ and proceed all the way to how to hold fast to Christ in loyalty through every trial.
By this correspondence, we see that Solomon's wisdom for how to grow to maturity this life and Christ's wisdom for 
how we are to become spiritually mature and prepare for the next life are one.

This insight came to me while lying in bed, lungs wheezing, throat coughing, head pounding, and miserable from 
possible pneumonia. As I reflected on Bible passages from Paul's letters that helped me in my youth, I had an
instant of clarity. It is more than a curious coincidence that the letters are arranged that way.
It also holds great meaning. Solomon was the wisest man in history and he described all the steps from birth to maturity.
He missed nothing. His schema for life is complete. That means that if the Apostle Paul's teachings match
every one of Solomon's life phases, then he didn't miss any phases either. His plan for discipling individual
Christians and shaping them into healthy, cooperative churches lacks nothing. It is a good thing to agree with
Peter when he says this: 

#### His divine power has granted to us all things 
#### that pertain to life and godliness, 
#### through the knowledge of him who called us 
#### to his own glory and excellence...
###### - 2 Peter 1:3

It is an even better thing to be able to see in Scripture a completeness criteria, given by Solomon,
applicable to Paul, that confirms this. Praise God! We have been given the whole picture!

NOTE: My original name for the pattern was  "The Seven Pieces of Peace", which I changed once I had a better handle on it. Likewise, the names I used to describe the seven phases of the pattern changed. Here is a concordance to help.
The Synonym is the name used in the original illustration. The poem in Ecclesiastes 3 only addresses
the path from birth to maturity. The latter chapters of the book then continue into the days of darkness,
physical and mental decline and death.

NOTE: The seven phases from Security to Loyalty are the main phases of the pattern. They are usually what 
is meant when the pattern is discussed in articles on this site. They are the ascending phases, from birth to loyalty. 

  - The Church is on a trajectory to reach full maturity right as Christ returns. It will pass through the first seven phases, enter the maturity phase during the Great Tribulation, then skip to the twelfth phase, to spend eternity in the presence of God.
  - The unsaved World is on a trajectory to reach maturity, before a steep decline ending in the second death. It passes through all twelve phases and spends eternity separated from God.
