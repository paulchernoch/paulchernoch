title: The Growth Pattern of Solomon
quote: To everything there is a season, <br/> A time for every purpose under heaven... <br/> - Ecclesiastes 3:1
---

#### For everything there is a season, 
#### and a time for every matter under heaven:
##### a time to be born, and a time to die;
##### a time to plant, 
###### and a time to pluck up what is planted;
##### a time to kill, and a time to heal;
##### a time to break down, and a time to build up;
##### a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
##### a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
##### a time to cast away stones, 
###### and a time to gather stones together;
##### a time to embrace, 
###### and a time to refrain from embracing;
##### a time to seek, and a time to lose;
##### a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
##### a time to tear, and a time to sew;
##### a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
##### a time to love, and a time to hate;
##### a time for war, and a time for peace.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

The scent of destiny wafts from Solomon's poetic phrasing. Cycle after cycle, fortune's reversals 
beat like a drum, lingering over hatred and war before ushering in the hoped for age of peace.
In 1959, Pete Seeger wrote the pop song "Turn, Turn, Turn", adorning and slightly reordering the words
from Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. The song was first released on vinyl in 1962 by the Limeliters, 
to be followed months later by Pete Seeger himself. However, the best known version that climbed the charts was
performed by the Byrds in 1965.

Why dredge up a lesson in pop history? First, I was born in 1962, the year the song was first recorded. 
Second, the ability to decode the meaning of this passage and discover its echoes elsewhere in the Bible is
the greatest gift that God has ever given me. It forms a large part of the answer to the burning question I
asked over thirty years ago. Christianity has so many ideas, doctrines, and rules that I could not wrap my
head around it all. I wanted a simpler way. I wanted to know the most important truths of the faith and
how they fit together so that I could use that as a framework for adding in all the rest. I needed a way
to manage the complexity. With the Harvest and Growth Patterns and the larger structure of Lady Wisdom's House,
I found that, but the Growth Pattern is the crucial one.

## What is the Growth Pattern for? 

First, it is a developmental model for the growth of a human being from birth to full maturity. 
It divides life into seven phases, each seven years in duration. The pattern governs the principal human needs
to be met or challenges to be faced in each period. It explains the rhythm of life "under the sun".
It is entirely materialistic.

Second, the pattern is a discipleship model for Christians to bring them from spiritual infancy to full maturity 
in the faith. Each materialistic phase has a spiritual analog. I saw this dimly as I wrote my recent books. 
Christians will not progress evenly through the phases; they do not last a set amount of time.
This article will report on a discovery I made after writing those books. The first seven of Paul's letters,
Romans, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, match the seven key phases of the 
Growth Pattern, in order. Each book has wise counsel on how to progress through its corresponding phase.

Third, the pattern is the mainspring for God's prophetic clocks. The poem serves as a parable for all of history,
or for shorter stretches of history; it applies at several scales. Thus one scale spans the whole of history
from the Creation to the second coming of Christ. A shorter scale starts with the dedication of Solomon's Temple.
An even shorter scale begins at Pentecost, with the establishment of the Church. The shortest I have found runs
from the Holocaust until the end; it prophesies the future of the modern nation of Israel.
The prophetic implications of this pattern will be discussed in a separate section of this website.

I discovered and documented the Growth Pattern while writing *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and made some 
elaborations to it in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. The next part of this article is adapted from
the chapter "There is a Season" in the former book. The concluding section of this article will explore new ground.
It will show how Paul's first seven letters, in the order found in your Bible, appear to have been divinely ordered
so as to teach a discipleship course. They proceed from teaching the new Christian the essential truth
of our eternal security in Christ and proceed all the way to how to hold fast to Christ in loyalty through every trial.
By this correspondence, we see that Solomon's wisdom for how to grow to maturity in this life and Christ's wisdom for 
how we are to become spiritually mature and prepare for the next life are one.

This insight came to me while lying in bed, lungs wheezing, throat coughing, head pounding, and miserable from 
possible pneumonia. As I reflected on Bible passages from Paul's letters that helped me in my youth, I had an
instant of clarity. It is more than a curious coincidence that the letters are arranged that way.
It also holds great meaning. Solomon was the wisest man in history and he described all the steps from birth to maturity.
He missed nothing. His schema for life is complete. That means that if the Apostle Paul's teachings match
every one of Solomon's life phases, then he didn't miss any phases either. His plan for discipling individual
Christians and shaping them into healthy, cooperative churches lacks nothing. It is a good thing to agree with
Peter when he says this: 

#### His divine power has granted to us all things 
#### that pertain to life and godliness, 
#### through the knowledge of him who called us 
#### to his own glory and excellence...
###### - 2 Peter 1:3

It is an even better thing to be able to see in Scripture a completeness criteria, given by Solomon,
applicable to Paul, that confirms this. For this reason we can say "Amen" to the Apostle Paul when 
he says these words:

#### Not that I have already obtained this \[resurrection\] 
#### or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, 
#### because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 
#### Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. 
#### But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and 
#### straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on 
#### toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of 
#### God in Christ Jesus. **Let those of us who are mature**  
#### think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, 
#### God will reveal that also to you.
###### - Philippians 3:12-15

Praise God! We can join the ranks of "those ... who are mature" because we have been given the whole picture! 
The whole course from salvation through sanctification to glorification has been marked
out for us, so we can cross the finish line.

NOTE: My original name for the pattern was  "The Seven Pieces of Peace", which I changed once I had a better handle on it. Likewise, the names I used to describe the seven phases of the pattern changed. Here is a concordance to help.
The Synonym is the name used in the original illustration. The poem in Ecclesiastes 3 only addresses
the path from birth to maturity. The latter chapters of the book then continue into the days of darkness,
physical and mental decline and death.

NOTE: The seven phases from Security to Loyalty are the main phases of the pattern. They are usually what 
is meant when the pattern is discussed in articles on this site. They are the ascending phases, from birth to loyalty. 

  - The Church is on a trajectory to reach full maturity right as Christ returns. It will pass through the first seven phases, enter the maturity phase during the Great Tribulation, then skip to the twelfth phase, to spend eternity in the presence of God.
  - The unsaved World is on a trajectory to reach maturity, before a steep decline ending in the second death. It passes through all twelve phases and spends eternity separated from God.

NOTE: The next section is from a chapter that built upon an earlier chapter in the book. 
That chapter introduced a sociological tool called the Five Factor Model (FFM) of Personality.
The five components of personality have the acronym OCEAN:

  - O = Openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
  - C = Conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
  - E = Extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
  - A = Agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/judgmental)
  - N = Neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

# There is a Season

Seasons. Living in New England, we have four. I love
the fragrance of lilacs and apple blossoms in Spring,
but due to allergies Autumn is my favorite. One
season gives me headaches, teary eyes and sneezes. The
other – tranquil walks through red and gold. In Israel, they
say they have four seasons, but mostly there is a wet season
and a dry season. In Ecclesiastes 3, we come upon a poem
with contrasting pairs of seasons. The pairing of verses
definitely has Israel’s two-season climate in mind.

#### To everything there is a season,
#### A time for every purpose under heaven:
#### A time to be born, And a time to die;
#### A time to plant, 
##### And a time to pluck what is planted;
#### A time to kill, And a time to heal;
#### A time to break down, And a time to build up;
#### A time to weep, And a time to laugh;

#### A time to mourn, And a time to dance;
#### A time to cast away stones, 
##### And a time to gather stones;
#### A time to embrace, 
##### And a time to refrain from embracing;
#### A time to gain, And a time to lose;
#### A time to keep, And a time to throw away;
#### A time to tear, And a time to sew;
#### A time to keep silence, And a time to speak;
#### A time to love, And a time to hate;
#### A time of war, And a time of peace.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, NKJV

Who can read these words without being captivated by
their simplicity, beauty and truth? They cry out for you to
immerse yourself in their meaning, find a pattern in their
poetry and discover treasures of insight. Perhaps you see
your current troubles in one of those pairs, stuck with the
bad season and praying for the good.

Can you answer its riddle? These pairs are not
haphazardly arranged. Nor are they merely diagnostic,
describing reality without giving you the tools to change it.
This poem contains a recipe for peace.

When I studied Job, I latched onto a few verses: “songs in
the night” (Job 35) was despairing me singing myself to
sleep, God treading on the waves of the sea (Job 9) was
anxious me facing life’s storms, the torment of dreams (Job 7) 
was idolatrous me misled by the occult, Elihu’s reference
to wineskins (Job 32) was joyful me bursting with the Holy
Spirit, and the whirlwind (Job 38) was complacent me
receiving a warning in a dream. By expanding my dim
understanding outward from those verses, after two years
of concerted study, I comprehended the whole book.

For Ecclesiastes, this poem of the seasons was my pivotal
passage, but understanding it took longer. About six years
ago, I tried to crack the mystery of Ecclesiastes. I wrote a
computer program to extract the most common phrases
from its text. “Under the sun” pops up in twenty-seven
verses. However, it shows up twice in some paragraphs and
is entirely absent from chapters 7, 11 and 12. It does not
seem to serve as a reliable divider for interpretative units.
Having learned about chiasms (inverted parallelisms that
pop up in many Bible books, including Job), I searched for
one in Ecclesiastes. I identified key themes to see if they
were organized in such a pattern, and saw none.

If you read what commentators say about the structure of
Ecclesiastes, you will find opinions like this, from the New
Century Bible Commentary:

#### "in general no progression of thought 
#### from one section to another is discernible." 
###### – R. N. Whybray (1989)

Does the Teacher talk in circles? Does the futility he
attributes to humanity’s search for purpose apply equally
to his book’s structure? Is it like the syncopated cacophony
of the pile-driver outside my college dorm window,
tormenting my mind as I searched futilely for a pattern so I
could tune it out?

The poem of the seasons screams, “I am the key to the
book!” It names twenty-eight seasons of life. Would it be
too much for those twenty-eight ideas to be covered, one
after another, in logical progression, like a table of
contents? Sadly, while most of those “seasons” are
commented on elsewhere in the book, some are not.
Matching some seasons to related passages creates
questionable correlations.

The word “time” or “times” occurs forty-six times in
Ecclesiastes. Between words like “time”, “season”, “sun”,
“moon”, “eternity”, and references to natural cycles, it is
blatantly obvious that besides futility, the second theme is
time: how you plan it, spend it, endure or enjoy it, waste it,
and are granted a limited portion of it.

The word “after” is an important marker, although things
get muddied depending on your Bible translation.
Ecclesiastes makes a clear distinction between two types of
futility: the vanity of our efforts today and the impossibility
of seeing the outcome of our efforts tomorrow. Sadly, my
favorite translation, the NIV, is the muddiest. It uses the
phrase “chasing after the wind” for the futility of what we
do today, thus causing the word “after” to occur in passages
relating to both senses of futility. To make things worse, it
also uses “afterward”, “future”, and “follow” in place of
“after”, making it tricky to use a concordance to find the
verses that relate to the concept.

Comparing translations, the futility of today’s activities is
rendered as “vexation of spirit” (KJV), “striving after wind”
(ASV), “striving after the wind” (ESV), “grasping for the
wind” (NKJV), “chasing after the wind” (NIV), and “a
pursuit of the wind” (HCSB). In each translation, this
futility of today is found nine times, in 1:14, 1:17, 2:11, 2:17,
2:26, 4:4, 4:6, 4:16, and 6:9.

The futility of tomorrow is more varied. Four times is
“after” used to speak of how one cannot see one’s own
future (3:22, 6:12, 7:14, and 10:14). Once it refers to the
impossibility of people from the future seeing back to us
(forgetfulness, in 1:11). Once it speaks of not knowing how
your successor (read children) will do (2:18). Once it speaks
of what you can see in the future: your own death (9:3).
The final occurrence of “after” is in the last chapter:

#### Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, 
#### before the evil days come and the years draw near 
#### of which you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”; 
#### before the sun and the light and the moon and
#### the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain...
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:1-2, ESV

There is argument over the interpretation. It may refer to
eyes cloudy with cataracts or the rapid succession of
troubles in our later years, causing tears. Our faculties fail
us and all possibility of planning the future departs.

Were you counting? That is nine words about the futility
of today and nine about the futility of tomorrow. These
matching numbers, repeated phrases and ideas torment
the reader with their insinuation of pattern, yet the
meaning remains hidden.

While studying Job, I was tempted to give up, read other
people’s commentaries and be done with it. Ditto here. I do
read commentaries. Years before researching Job, I read
one about that book. However, despite many useful
observations made by that author (whose other works I also
read and accepted), I concluded he was wrong on a vital
point that shaped my entire understanding of Job.

My first months studying Job had to do with unlearning
the wrong ideas I had previously absorbed. Commentators
argue over every word. It is not good enough to accept
what sounds like the best argument for every verse. If you
assemble those pieces, you find inconsistencies: the puzzle
won’t fit together. The best coherent picture of the overall
book requires picking and choosing some views that are in
the minority. Only after I had arrived at a coherent
structure of Job could I go back and search for others who
agreed, to see if my ideas were novel (hence suspect) or
had good support. This process is what gave me
confidence: if other people, with different educational and
doctrinal backgrounds, following a different process, came
to the same conclusions as I, then I knew I was on the right
track. When on top of that I felt in my spirit that it was true,
such confirmation encouraged me to press on.

I followed this course with Ecclesiastes. I am glad that I
came to my conclusions before being swayed by other’s
opinions, because I could get sucked down a rabbit hole.
Take this poem in chapter three. The verses describe
twenty-eight times. What do people make of that number?

The astrologers of ancient Babylon, Greece and China,
the Hindu mystics of India, and the Arab mathematicians
divided the heavens into twenty-eight lunar mansions.
Instead of the familiar twelve zodiac constellations, they
divided the most prominent stars into twenty-eight groups.
Followers of mystical Jewish Kabbalah do likewise.

To the Hindus, the moon god had twenty-seven wives,
one in each mansion, called a Nakshatra. Tucked among
the wives, in the twenty-second mansion sat Abhijit, whose
Nakshatra includes the star Vega from the constellation
Lyra. Abhijit – unlike the other twenty-seven – was male,
“the one who cannot be defeated”. Maybe not – to simplify
the math, some Hindu traditions reduced the number of
Nakshatras to twenty-seven and kicked poor Abhijit out of
his mansion. (The moon god was probably jealous at only
having twenty-seven wives. Look at Solomon. He had 700!)

Why did ancient peoples use these numbers, whether 27
or 28? The sidereal lunar month is 27.32 days. A sidereal
month measures how long it takes for the moon to make
one circuit about the earth relative to the fixed stars. Since
the earth is moving around the sun at the same time, the
moon is always playing catch-up. That is why the lunar
phases last about 29.5 days, called a synodic month.

Search the web. You’ll find the most fanciful astrological
interpretations of this passage. We will steer clear of such
debatable insights. One thing is solid: Solomon was making
an intentional reference to the lunar cycle and Israel’s lunar
calendar. One “time” is given for each day of the month.
This implies a cyclical pattern to life, since the moon
continues endlessly on its course, as well as asserting that
the list is complete, since all days are covered.

The book’s second most common time reference is to life
“under the sun”. The sun governs two cycles: the daily
cycle and the yearly cycle. That phrase occurs in twenty-
seven verses. If it equaled the number of “times” in the
poem, that would be a dead giveaway they were related. If
very different, you wouldn’t give it any thought. Instead,
the numbers differ by one, and twenty-seven is used by
some ancient cultures instead of twenty-eight for the
number of lunar mansions. It makes you want to pull out
your hair. Perhaps if we compared the context surrounding
each occurrence of “under the sun” with those twenty-
eight “times”? You can look. I did. No correspondence.

My failure was due to a simple error. The search feature
in my iPad Bible app lists all verses that contain the search
phrase. I counted the verses with the phrase “under the
sun” and saw twenty-seven. Only as I was writing the final
chapters of this book and studying each verse in detail did I
spot my mistake. Ecclesiastes 9:9 uses the phrase “under
the sun” twice! Thus there are twenty-eight occurrences of
“under the sun”. The double usage in verse 9:9 marks that
verse as special, but what that means must wait until later.

Inconsistencies abound. In some pairs, the desirable
“time” comes first, in others, last. Another suggestive detail
is that some consecutive pairs are related. Born & die vs
plant & pluck, or weep & laugh vs mourn & dance. Others,
not so much, like tear & sew vs silence & speak.

While struggling to outline this book, a fellow writer
suggested mind mapping to gain insight. It worked. Then I
thought, why not see if I can find a pattern in the
organization of the twenty-eight times? That worked, too.

I take things literally. Keeps me from recognizing
metaphorical meanings. Given the partial agreement
between groups of four “times”, I clustered them that way
and asked, “If seemingly unlike items belong together, how
must I alter their meanings so that the groupings make
sense?” I hoped to find metaphorical meanings that would
not do injury to the Scriptures. I also needed a test to prove
I had not concocted a fanciful, allegorical meaning of the
kind once fashionable in the church but now ridiculed.
That test was that from the seven groupings of four “times”
I could synthesize a single, overarching message. The
groupings needed to tell a story, and that story had to agree
with the rest of the book. They do – and it does.

**Behold the Seven Pieces of Peace (aka Growth Pattern):**

<img alt="The Seven Pieces of Peace" src="images/seven-pieces-of-peace.png" width="675" height="425"/>

The story that the poem in Ecclesiastes 3 tells is simple:

**You must attend wisely**

**to seven areas of life**

**if you are to enjoy peace.**

On the “mind map” illustration, the first pair of times, for
birth and death, occur at about 3 o’clock. The progression
is clockwise (of course), but along the left side of the
diagram, the progression for each group of four times is
from top to bottom. The cycle ends again near 3 o’clock, for
war and peace.

## Existence (Security)

The first group is *birth and death, planting and plucking up*.
Initially, it looks like animal life and vegetable life. This
could mean herding cattle and raising crops, the essential
components of an agricultural society.

However, as parables, they refer to human life. Human
birth and death is the first pair. Here is the first revelation:
death is not the last “time” in the entire list. The message is
optimistic. Peace is the last “time”. The journey can have a
happy ending.

If plant and pluck refer to people, what can they mean?
Planting is building a home and putting down roots.

#### They will be like a tree planted by the water
##### that sends out its roots by the stream.
#### It does not fear when heat comes;
##### its leaves are always green.
#### It has no worries in a year of drought
##### and never fails to bear fruit.” 
###### - Jeremiah 17:8, NIV

To Jeremiah, a planted person is one positioned where all
the raw materials they need for success are handy.

Plucking up has to do with moving, either by choice or
necessity. In a negative sense, the Psalmist says:

#### Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin:
#### He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent;
##### he will uproot you from the land of the living. 
###### - Psalm 52:5, NIV

This pair is about shelter and protection, or its loss. This
phase of life is about obtaining **security**.

As children, we need our parents to give birth to us and
provide us with life. We need protection from the elements:
a house, a tent, a cave – something. Our need for food then
takes in the agricultural aspects of the parable.

Combined, we need the basics of food, shelter, and
health in order to survive and grow. As a baby, this is most
of what we need, but throughout life, we never stop
needing these things.

## Function (Ability)

The second set of four is *kill, heal, break down, and build up*. 
Killing and healing have to do with the body. A suitable
interpretation of the other two is the formation of the
intellect. Breaking down is removing false ideas, while
building up is teaching a child the right way to think and
act.

After infancy, a child grows in height but also in
knowledge and physical ability. For a peaceful life, we need
an educated, sound mind (the realm of cognition we
previously discussed) and a healthy body trained to do
useful things. This phase of life is about growing in **ability**.

## Emotions (Stability)

When a person reaches their teen years, their biggest
challenge is learning emotional self control. This third set
of four seasons is *weep, laugh, mourn and dance*. The first
two comprise verbal self control. The second pair is
physical self control, governing actions and impulses. This
is the area where the Big Five factor of neuroticism comes
into play. By definition, it is impossible to be at peace when
powerful emotions are raging through your heart.
However, Solomon cautioned that mourning should not be
avoided or suppressed, or its opposite, joy, will be banished
as well. This phase of life is about acquiring **stability**.

## Relationships (Amity)

This fourth category name was puzzling to arrive at.
What do *casting away stones* and *gathering stones* have to do
with *embracing* and *refraining from embracing*?

Interpreters are divided over the stones. Farmers gather
stones from a field to prepare it for plowing. Perhaps
invading soldiers toss the stones back in to harass the
populace by disrupting their planting? Or are stones
gathered to construct a building, and scattered to destroy
it?

If they are to relate to embracing, those activities must
have the connotation of collaborating together in a venture
versus moving apart in opposition.

In marriage, if a husband and a wife are to enjoy a fruitful
life together, they need to come together in two ways: in
the chores of life, work shouldered together, and in
physical and emotional intimacy, thus the embracing.

The period in life where people generally begin to
wrestle with these challenges follows the teen years.
Throwing away stones then would mean dissolving a
relationship that didn’t work out.

Collaboration falls under the aegis of the factor of
conscientiousness, while intimacy is related to openness,
and both are tempered by agreeableness.

Yet we must not settle for an outcome built solely upon
the best foundation we can erect:

#### Though one may be overpowered,
##### two can defend themselves.
###### A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 4:12, NIV

We need that third strand. This phase of life is about
learning to display **amity**.

(If different times in history can be characterized by
these twenty-eight seasons, ours is “a time to refrain from
embracing”, e.g. social distancing due to the pandemic.)

## Resources (Opportunity)

The fifth of the seven pieces is *a time to seek, and a time to lose;*
*a time to keep, and a time to cast away*. If both pairs are
assumed to relate to possessions, they are redundant. It
makes sense to conclude that the first concerns
opportunities, our “immaterial” possessions, while the
second addresses material possessions.

Extroversion and Openness enter the picture with
opportunities, as an extrovert must engage with people to
find and develop those business ventures, but only an open
person is attuned to new ideas. Conscientiousness is
needed to succeed once the opportunity is realized, and
agreeableness prevents partners from being alienated.

A lost opportunity is not necessarily a bad thing.
Discretion and opportunity cost force a person to analyze,
strategize and prioritize. Some options must be rejected.
Cognition factors in heavily.

On the material side, introverts might make better
conservators of wealth and less agreeable people willing to
say no may avoid risks, like being conned.

#### A feast is made for laughter, 
##### wine makes life merry, 
###### and money is the answer for everything. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:19, NIV

This phase of human development spans most of our
working life, but in our days especially the fourth decade of
life. A person can fail anywhere along the way, but here is
where the failure is most visible and where the separation
of successful and unsuccessful accelerates. Money may not
solve all our problems, but how we handle it is the answer
we give to the world about what kind of person we are. If
early cracks open in our marriage, if we never overcame
the emotional turmoil of our teen years, now the reckoning
arrives.

This phase of life is about being wise in identifying,
pursuing or rejecting **opportunity**.

## Communication (Community)

To acquire the sixth piece of peace, we face four critical
seasons: a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent
and a time to speak. (3:7, NIV) The trials revolve around
trust and openness.

Tearing is the weakening and breaking of friendships,
marriages, partnerships, and even church fellowships.
Mending is forgiveness, repentance, and renegotiation.

#### Whoever would foster love 
##### covers over an offense,
#### but whoever repeats the matter 
##### separates close friends.
###### - Proverbs 17:9, NIV

#### Above all, love each other deeply, 
##### because love covers over a multitude of sins. 
###### 1 Peter 4:8, NIV

My wife and I fell into disagreement with our church
years ago. We left it for seven years. By the grace of God, a
way opened up for us to be mutually reconciled. We
returned sixteen years ago. That church has been a tower of
strength in my life. Mending is critical.

Similarly, I had a falling out with my father once and
refused to talk to him for three years. At my wife’s urging, I
eventually forgave him unilaterally. Years later, he softened
and apologized for many things. Moreover, he developed a
genuine kindness and politeness, a significant change in
personality. The last ten years or so, I have been closer to
him than at any time since my early childhood.

Times of tearing come to us all. They are tests. We can
rebuild something stronger than it was before, or refuse to
change and drift through life without strong attachments.

Battles over trust open us up or close us off. Silence can
be good, as listening – or bad, with severed lines of
communication. Likewise, speaking can be measured and
patient, or accusatory and inflammatory.

Openness and Agreeableness can be assets here. The self
control of one low on trait Neuroticism can prevent crises
from escalating. One habit goes the furthest: listening to
God. The silence of prayer is ALWAYS in season:

#### Guard your steps when you go 
##### to the house of God. 
#### Go near to listen rather than 
##### to offer the sacrifice of fools, 
###### who do not know that they do wrong. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 5:1, NIV

How do we listen? We engage in the thirteen means of
communicating with God listed in the section on the
paradox of love: observing nature, listening to our elders,
praying, fasting, pondering our dreams and visions (with
care), learning from suffering, listening to prophets (with
discernment), marveling at God’s miracles, accepting the
ministrations of angels, hearing directly through a
theophany, observing the sabbath, offering sacrifices, and
reading the Word of God. These means have been available
since antiquity and Job availed himself of all of them. I
know of no other means beyond these, but I can’t be
certain there aren’t any. If you find one, search the Bible
carefully before you trust it. People have tried many other
ways to contact God and He has not been silent in His
condemnation of those attempts.

This phase of life is all about forming and maintaining
**community**.

## Loyalty

Of the seven pieces of peace, this category offers the
most trouble. As the final piece, it should have a grand and
indisputable title. *Love and hate, war and peace*... 
Peace is the goal of Ecclesiastes. As it is both listed as one of the
seasons and encompasses the whole, it is not a suitable
name for one part. Love is the theme of Job, Jesus’ great
commandment, and Paul’s highest virtue, but it, too, is a
listed season. How to you combine love and peace into a
single, overarching category? You don’t. They are joined by
their opposites.

What is love? It is the mobilizing of every resource and
mental and emotional faculty in the service of the beloved.
Love invites, opens, and accepts. It says, “I stand for you; I
stand with you; Where you go, I will go; I choose you.”

What is hate? It is barring gates, raising walls, and
opposing every word or overture. It says, “I stand against
you; I will leave you; I reject you.”

Together, love and hate are about attitude, disposition,
and decision. Words and actions may flow from them, but
love and hate are the wellspring.

With love, you know a swift approach and a warm
embrace are on their way before you see a muscle move.
The times of love and hate are about choosing sides. Then
comes war.

War is action. You already declared your allegiance, and
the battle lines have already been drawn, now you prove
your allegiance on the field of battle. Your attitude is made

manifest by your demonstration of loyalty and courage.
After the war ends, the winner enjoys the peace that
follows.

**Attitude + Demonstration = Loyalty**

This was Solomon’s stumbling block. He wavered in his
loyalty to Yahweh, drawn into his wives’ idolatry.

I am in the middle of writing another book, one I set
aside so I could tackle this one. The working title is The
Loyalty of Trolls. Near the beginning of that project, I
struggled to find a suitable theme. Then a family squabble
intruded and I was forced to make a decision that runs
against my grain. I had to take sides in an argument. I had
to demonstrate my loyalty.

Loyalty has not played a big role in my thinking about
life. Ideas, truths, and doctrines I will research and dissect
and reject or defend. However, in keeping with my
Asperger’s, my attachments to people are weaker and
based upon strange reasons. A few years ago it dawned on
me why I choose the subjects I write about. I write about
my weaknesses.

  - Convictions & Priorities.
  - Empathy & Kindness.
  - Loyalty & Knowing the right Time.

I explore them first in fiction and then in fact. Based on
this, I am certain that Loyalty is the final piece to the puzzle
of peace.

These seven pieces have one part that is mental,
emotional or verbal, and a second part that requires action.
This applies even to “a time to be born, and a time to die”.
Physical birth and death might not have the mental
component, but there is our spiritual birth and death,
being “born again” and dying to self as we are “crucified in
Christ”.

A skeptic will mock, “I learned all that in my first
semester of developmental psychology. I expect more from
the so-called wisest man in all the world.” Is Solomon’s
genius merely poetic, masking commonplace maxims in
complex metaphors? Will effort expended to decode it pay
off?

Solomon summarized the process of the physical, mental
and spiritual development of a person from birth to death
with razor sharp accuracy in eight verses. Then he spent
the rest of his book elaborating on challenges that threaten
this process, and the source of their solution:

*What do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God
has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its
time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one
can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. I know
that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do
good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find
satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. I know that
everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it
and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.*
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:9-14, NIV

Psychologists labor mightily to find remedies for
maladies afflicting children, teens, young adults, parents,
and senior citizens. What do they know about the eternity
in our hearts? What substitute can they offer for the eighth
piece, the hole in the middle of our soul? Every minute,
every mile, we need God. If Solomon can summarize life in
eight verses, can we not summarize what we need from
God in ten words?

When the Cold War ended, people were excited that we
could divert resources once spent on weapons towards
peaceful ends. They called it the “peace dividend”. I look
forward to the day when our warfare is concluded. Until
then, here is how Jesus serves us in the seven areas of life:

#### Tree of life,
#### Healer,
#### Comforter,
#### Friend;
#### Giver,
#### Confidant,
#### Peace dividend.

To scholars who cannot see a logical progression in the
argument put forth in Ecclesiastes, let us offer this first sign
that one exists. In eight verses, from birth to death, we
have the course of life through all its seasons. Sort of…

## More Seasons!

For reasons that will become clear later, Ecclesiastes 3
does not cover all the seasons of life, merely those leading
up to maturity. Ecclesiastes is structured to describe two
trajectories for life that parallel two trajectories of history.
The first trajectory is that of the believing soul and the
church, whose path ends in peace when Christ returns.

That is the pattern found in the poem. The second
trajectory is that of the body, the unbelieving soul, and the
world, which peak and then decline toward destruction, at
the final judgment. That pattern extends beyond the poem
and occupies the final chapters of Solomon’s book.

In keeping with the “-ty” endings of the previous seven
phases, here is the complete list of seasons of life as
revealed by Solomon:

  - Security
  - Ability
  - Stability
  - Amity
  - Opportunity
  - Community
  - Loyalty
  - Maturity
  - Frailty
  - Senility
  - Mortality
  - Eternity

Many unfortunates have their lives cut short and reach
mortality ahead of schedule. Some are blessed, like Moses
who exited life in full vigor of mind and body. The rest of us
will pass through years of decline before our clock strikes
midnight and we are collected by the angels in our final
harvest. Before the end, the whole world will enter a
period of irreversible decline. Will we wed ourselves to its
dark fate, or to the church whose light will shine like the
arriving dawn?

## Don’t Be Passive!

At first blush, the list of times projects an idea of
passively reacting to the unpredictable events of life. The
Teacher did voice such ideas when he said
*“time and chance happen to them all”* in verse 9:11 or

#### “When times are good, be happy; 
##### but when times are bad, consider this: 
#### God has made the one 
##### as well as the other. 
#### Therefore, no one can discover
##### anything about their future.” 
###### - Ecclesiastes 7:14

Praise God! Now we see there is a divine purpose to the
stages of life, a calendar exhibiting His care. These twenty-
eight seasons are not entirely unpredictable as they sweep
over us. We can prepare, we can assess our obstacles and
take action. God has given us wisdom that we may thrive.
Will that wisdom let us down? Solomon answered that
question elsewhere when he spoke of wisdom:

#### Long life is in her right hand;
##### in her left hand are riches and honor.
#### Her ways are pleasant ways,
##### and all her paths are peace. 
###### - Proverbs 3:16-17, NIV

What about the remaining chapters? Could it be that
students of this book cannot see the larger pattern because,
having set their sights too low, their eyes are out of focus?
Do you use a microscope to study the stars? Will a
stopwatch measure eternity?
