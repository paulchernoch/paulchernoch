title: The Growth Pattern of Solomon
quote: To everything there is a season, <br/> A time for every purpose under heaven... <br/> - Ecclesiastes 3:1
---
The scent of destiny wafts from Solomon's poetic phrasing. Cycle after cycle, fortune's reversals 
beat like a drum, lingering over hatred and war before ushering in the hoped for age of peace.
In 1959, Pete Seeger wrote the pop song "Turn, Turn, Turn", adorning and slightly reordering the words
from Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. The song was first released on vinyl in 1962 by the Limeliters, 
to be followed months later by Pete Seeger himself. However, the best known version that climbed the charts was
performed by the Byrds in 1965.

Why dredge up a lesson in pop history? First, I was born in 1962, the year the song was first recorded. 
Second, the ability to decode the meaning of this passage and discover its echoes elsewhere in the Bible is
the greatest gift that God has ever given me. It forms a large part of the answer to the burning question I
asked over thirty years ago. Christianity has so many ideas, doctrines, and rules that I could not wrap my
head around it all. I wanted a simpler way. I wanted to know the most important truths of the faith and
how they fit together so that I could use that as a framework for adding in all the rest. I needed a way
to manage the complexity. With the Harvest and Growth Patterns and the larger structure of Lady Wisdom's House,
I found that, but the Growth Pattern is the crucial one.

I discovered and documented the Growth Pattern while writing *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and made some 
elaborations to it in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. The better part of this article is adapted from
the chapter "There is a Season" in the former book. My original name for the pattern was 
"The Seven Pieces of Peace", which I changed once I had a better handle on it. Likewise, the names
I used to describe the seven phases of the pattern changed. Here is a concordance to help.
The Synonym is the name used in the original illustration.
