title: Against Complementarianism
---
In early 2024, the booklet *Jesus, Justice & Gender Roles* by Kathy Keller (published in 2012)
was circulated in my church. Keller advocates for a complementarian approach to
church leadership. The author claims that the Bible teaches that women may not serve as pastors or elders
in churches, but may serve in all other capacities. This article will not critique the whole booklet, 
but focus on three weaknesses in her argument. Exploiting those three weaknesses, it will offer ideas to 
support the opposing view of egalitarianism. But first, a little about why I hold the views that I do.

## Declaration Against Interest

In law, there is a principle known as *declaration against interest*. By this principle, 
hearsay testimony by a person who holds a stake in the opposite view is considered highly credible.
For example, if a man testifies to something that will cause him to lose reputation, money,
or to be charged with a crime himself because of his testimony, he will be believed and his words accepted
in court. I am offering such testimony. I am admitting that for most of my life, I was wrong.

I once wholeheartedly accepted the complementarian view. I even left a church when it changed from being 
complementarian to egalitarian. This cost me friends. I held to varying strains of this philosophy 
from the time I became a Christian in April 1985 until I became persuaded
of the opposite opinion in December 2020. Why? Was it because of peer pressure or to win the favor
of others? Was it because I am easily swayed or lazy and do not carefully study both sides of an argument?

I have held and continue to hold many political and religious views that are mocked or considered 
repugnant by the people of my liberal state, such as being pro-life, opposed to same sex marriage,
or believing that God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days
not more than seven thousand years ago.

I have lost friends and strained relationships many times on account of such views.
My job was once threatened by a project leader at a management consultant company because
I refused to work on the sabbath. Neither then nor during the decades since have I have backed down on 
my commitment to sabbath observance. Therefore, it is not because of peer pressure, social ostracism,
or a desire to win the favor of anyone that I changed my opinion about this. 
Nor did any person confront me with a new book or better logic. 
Instead, I was confronted by two things: my sin and my ignorance.

I was studying world history in the light of the Bible, trying to see from Scripture God's unfolding
plan over the millennia for the ending of many evils, like religious intolerance, slavery, racism, 
and colonialism. Suddenly, I was struck that nowhere in my research had I derived any results concerning God's 
plan for the liberation of women from oppression. The damning realization was not that I had
not found God's plan. My sin was that I had not even asked the question! All my curiosity at
poring over millennia of history to understand God's ways and I had no curiosity about
the Almighty's great concern for his daughters and how he was determined to show it.
My lack of empathy was a grave sin.

I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "Lord, what is your plan for the liberation of women 
from oppression?" Over the course of the next week, I pored over the Bible. God's glory
entered my mind and illuminated passages and ideas that I had either never seen before or discounted
and downplayed. I did a complete 180. I now believe that I was not only factually wrong, 
I was spiritually deaf to what God has to say about such things. I was not just ignorant, but culpable.

And God is forgiving.

## The Three Errors of Kathy Keller

Keller's book is concise and well-written. She offers excellent exegesis of passages that demolish 
the more extreme views of churches who place even more restrictions upon women than she advocates.
Without her penetrating logic, I would have overlooked critical holes in my own argument.
I owe her a debt because I would have overlooked a key aspect of the most wonderful Biblical evidence
in favor of egalitarianism, the need for a Biblical model of ordination that applies to women. 
Before we get to that, here are the errors that I spotted. I will collect the quotes up front, 
then address each in turn.

#### "What is clear in the Bible interprets what is cloudy." 
###### - Page 12

#### "Why did God arrange things this way, 
#### with a gender-based division of labor?" 
#### At the end of the day, I still don't know.
###### - Page 29

#### "... and your life takes on meaning and matures
#### when you conform to God's will, not when
#### you get to do what you want to do."
###### - Page 32

**Perspicacity**. The first quote argues for the perspicacity of Scripture. The main things are the plain things
and the plain things are the main things. It is a fruitful attitude to hold when approaching
the more confusing passages of the Bible. However, is it universally applicable?
Can God's plan for women vis-a-vis leadership in the church be understood from the clear passages
alone? Consider Solomon's words:
 
#### It is the glory of God to conceal things, 
##### but the glory of kings is to search things out.
###### - Proverbs 25:2

Reflect on Solomon's words. **This is a glory issue.** It is not clear. It must be searched out.

Recall the story in the Book of Acts about Cornelius, Peter and the acceptance of the Gentiles into the church.
The Old Testament is filled with promises of God's desire to spread his message to all peoples, not just the Jews.
Not until Peter's vision of being permitted to eat unclean animals did the church accept this
"obvious" truth. It is not the clear words that govern the meaning, it is the defining passages
that do so. The defining passages for a topic can then be used to deal with the special cases.
Sometimes the Holy Spirit must illuminate a formerly unrecognized defining passage so that its
teaching may be applied to the unclear verses elsewhere. In a while I will show that there
is a defining portion of the Bible that tackles the issue of God's plan for women and it has 
been overlooked by the church.

**Purpose**. With the second quote, Keller admits **ignorance** as to God's purposes concerning 
the restrictions upon women. Such humility is a good start. However, what if knowing the very thing 
of which she claims ignorance is essential if we are to arrive at a true and just understanding? 
There are two ways to read this: as a fact or as an attitude. As a fact, it is a statement that 
the Lord has not revealed this information. As an attitude, it is a resistance to looking for that 
answer, persevering until you have it, and then forming your conclusions.

#### **Q:** Has God has revealed to us this information about why women are suffering? 
#### **A:** Yes. 

#### **Q:** How do we know? 
#### **A:** We know because He promised that He would tell it to us. 

#### **Q:** Where is the promise? 
#### **A:** In the Book of Amos.

Keller's problem is that she is close to charging God with breaking that promise. 

#### Is a trumpet blown in a city,
##### and the people are not afraid?
#### Does disaster come to a city,
##### unless the Lord has done it?

#### For the Lord God does nothing
##### without revealing his secret
###### to his servants the prophets.
###### - Amos 3:6-7

What was the first breach in human relationships?

What problem affects half of humanity?

Of all the trials afflicting the world, which by its very magnitude and longevity 
screams loudest for a solution with the possible exception of mortality itself?

If ANY plan of God's to address ANY evil in the world deserves to be spelled out
in Scripture, the plan to relieve the suffering of women is that plan.
Surely the purpose behind the suffering of women is integral to the purpose behind God's plan.

Years ago, a man gave a talk at Ruggles Baptist Church. He shared his ideas about
Revelation. Revelation is filled with plagues. I asked the speaker why God chose the 
particular plagues that He did. What was the purpose behind each plague? He said he didn't know.
I figured that if he didn't know why, he really didn't know. 

Since Keller admits she doesn't know why, she really doesn't know.

I know why. I don't know *everything* about the why, but I learned *something* about it.
I learned enough about the WHY to also know the WHEN. The WHEN is when God began to permit 
women to serve as pastors and elders.

Why should there be a when? Why not have women endure this until the end? 
The reason is found in Isaiah. Even if we do not know the cause for suffering, 
we can know that it will end.

#### **Does he who plows for sowing plow continually?**
##### Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
#### When he has leveled its surface,
##### does he not scatter dill, sow cumin,
#### and put in wheat in rows
##### and barley in its proper place,
##### and emmer as the border?
#### For he is rightly instructed;
##### his God teaches him.
###### - Isaiah 28:24-26

The prophet tells us that you don't plow forever. Eventually you plant, the seed grows, 
and you reap a harvest. Plowing is used in Scripture as a metaphor for suffering, as in 
Psalms 129 and 141, as well as Job 1. The plowing of the wicked may not end, but not the 
plowing of the righteous. 

**This is a sacrifice issue**. No suffering ordained by God for our good is without 
purpose or an end date.

**Hearing**. In the third quote, the Keller accuses women of pursuing these offices so
they can "get to do what \[they\] want to do". I doubt that women are different from men
when it comes to their capacity for pride and presumption. I will apply Keller's charge to myself.

From 1989 to 1993, I passionately pursued oversea missionary service until the mission board, 
Pastor Larry, and finally my own reluctant spirit said no, I was not called.

Around that time I also pursued studies at seminary until it became clear to me 
that I was not called to the pastorate. I wept bitterly.

Only after another decade passed did the Lord begin to guide me into my calling, in the area 
of Christian writing.

I was a proud, impulsive, multi-talented MIT graduate passionately set on pursuiing a course
that God had not ordained and yet I heard the voice of the Holy Spirit when he said, "No!" 
I heard and obeyed with tears. Are not godly women equally capable of hearing a "No!" from God?
Or a "Yes"?

**This is a spiritual hearing issue.**

## The Three Errors, Synthesized

The three errors fall into three complementary categories that touch on the three principle aspects 
of a person: the mind, the heart and the hand.

  - The windows to the *mind* are your *ears*. They let God's truth in.

  - The windows to the *heart* are your *eyes*. They let God's glory in.

  - The door from the soul to the *world* is your *hands*. By them your actions speak your purposes, priorities and plans to the world and to God.

Keller said women cannot clearly **hear** from God concerning their calling. 
She herself did not **see** the glory of the hidden words that Solomon urged us to seek out, words that
free women to lead. And she dismisses as inadequate the collective sacrifice offered by the **hands** of Christian women
down through the centuries. Abraham paid a tenth to Melchizedek. In American Colonial times, 
one in eight women died in childbirth, and by many other measures they devoted themselves to
the work handed to them. What more sacrifice is needed?

The three categories above are not chosen as a rhetorical device. Jesus alluded to them in his parable
about the sower and the seed. 

  - The **seed** snatched by the bird is the knowledge of the gospel targeted at your **ears**. Trampled earth represents our deaf ears.
  - The **rocky soil** is the **heart** that shuts out the glory of God shining from the sun. It needs the water of the Holy Spirit to survive, like tears of repentance to wash the dust from our eyes.
  - The **thorny soil** is the **hand** that won't give. Its priorities are selfish, its habits dissolute, and its sacrifices made for show. It needs to have those clingy weeds pulled up and those thorns pruned, to mourn the loss of worthless things and find things of eternal value.

Keller is a well-educated, dedicated Christian with long experience in Christian minstry. Who am I to challenge her?
Where do I get the audacity to say that I understand these things better? I get it from making the same mistakes that she made
and having God turn me around. Here are my credentials:

**Hearing.** In January 2005, I lost all hearing in my left ear. A month of steroids and trips to the doctor did nothing. 
At the end of one doctor visit, I went into the waiting room and pulled out my Bible and a card with a yearly Bible reading plan.
The plan told me to open to Exodus 4, where God is speaking to Moses from the burning bush. This is what I read:

#### Then the Lord said to him, 
##### “Who has made man's mouth? 
##### Who makes him mute, or **deaf**, or seeing, or blind? 
##### Is it not I, the Lord? 
##### Now therefore go, and **I will be with your mouth **
##### **and teach you what you shall speak**.”
###### - Exodus 4:11-12

That is the only place in the Bible that says that God makes people deaf. As I read those words, I knew God was in the room with me.
He knew why I was deaf and it was part of his plan. I accepted it in peace and stopped praying for healing.
Two days later, my hearing returned. By these words from God, I received a sobering message. I was spiritually deaf.
I also received a promise. The Lord would open my spiritual ears so that I could learn the things that he would teach me.

That was why, years later, I was able to ask the Lord about his plan for freeing women from oppression and hear an answer that
contradicted what I believed.

**Seeing.** Around 2012, reflecting on Moses again, I realized that he knew something that I did not: what is of ultimate value.
A conversation between Moses and God in Exodus shows us what Moses desired to see above everything else in all creation.

#### Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” 
###### - Exodus 33:18

God's glory was what Moses' eyes longed most to see. My priorities were different. What did I do about it? I prayed.
For the next three years I fasted each Monday, and repeated the same simple prayer: "Lord, show me your glory."
During the time of my fast I saw no visions, had no dreams, and experienced no miracles, yet when I concluded my fast,
I knew that I had been heard. A year later, I began to see the world differently. I lost my job and a few days later, 
my mother died. Though out of work and with no savings, my first thought was to help my father in his time of sorrow. 
I took him on a vacation to New York City to visit his relatives and the city of his birth. Then I stayed with him
in the hospital for weeks when he almost died of anaplasmosis. All this time I was at peace. A year after that, 
the Lord began to open up the Scriptures to me, starting with Job. He was showing me His glory through His Word. 
My studies of Job eventually led me to revise my ideas about women in leadership, among other things.

**Touching.** There is no specific connection between my miraculous recovery of hearing, my prayer to see God's glory,
and receiving wisdom about God's plan for women in ministry. When someone challenged me a couple years ago
by asking something along the lines of "Why would God choose you to tell these things?", I had no answer.
Only while reflecting on Keller's book did the answer finally come to me. It is with our hands that we offer
our sacrifices to God. Some sacrifices we make willingly. Others are involuntary. They spring from the sufferings of life.
The latter provoke deep mourning. Just as women have made both kinds of offering, so have I.

*First, the suffering*. Around 2003, I dreamt that while driving my family in our car, a tornado caught us up.
We were lifted up, then came crashing down. This repeated too many times to count: up, down, up, down. 
Then the storm ended and we drove on in safety. Days later, a visiting preacher at the International Family Church
spoke about Jesus calming the storm. He said that the reason Jesus guided the disciples into the storm was not 
primarily to teach them faith. They entered the storm so that they could reach the other side of the lake.
Two demon-possessed men were waiting there, in desperate need of a savior.

The conjunction of dream and sermon told me that God was about to thrust my family and I into a long storm but that 
it would eventually come to an end and we would move on in safety. The imagery of a whirlwind would one day 
guide me to study Job. And like my hearing loss less than two years later, I was being told that on the other side of the
storm there would be something fruitful for me to do.

This nearly two decade long period of suffering gave me empathy for women who fear that their suffering has no end.
All suffering has an end. The suffering of the faithful also has a noble purpose. I am convinced that what
God made plain to me is also true of women. They were subjected to a long trial, but it is over and we should acknowledge that.

*Second, the sacrifice*. When I was in my late twenties, I was foolish with money. I made one really bad decision and the Lord
spoke to me sternly in a dream, warning me to reverse my decision, which warning I heeded. Some months later, I 
came into a sum of money. Knowing that I could not trust myself to make wise use of the money, I prayed. I asked the Lord
to let me know what I should do with the money. In my prayer, I named the exact amount: eight thousand dollars.
At the time, this was more that half of all I owned in this world.

Days later, I attended a prayer meeting. One person at the meeting said that a Christian charity for which she volunteered
had an urgent need. The amount of that need was exactly eight thousand dollars.

Days later, I went to Pastor Larry and asked him to pray with me, to decide if it was really the Lord's will.
I was a willing but not so cheerful giver. Then I made arrangements to give the money anonymously, because
Jesus warned us about making big gestures to gain the approval of men. After I made this sacrifice, I searched my
heart and did not like how hard it was for me to obey. In the Bible, when many people offered God a sacrifice they also
made a petition. What did I ask God for? I prayed, "Lord, give me a generous heart."

It was a generous heart that I would one day need if I was to expend months of study, writing and prayer for the benefit of women.
So why did God answer my prayer by directing me to study what His word says about this particular subject?
Why shine a light on His care for the suffering of women?
It was because the money that I donated, most of what I owned, was to a crisis pregnancy center. And so the Lord taught me the meaning of 
these words of Saint Paul:

#### and she shall be saved through **the child-bearing**, 
##### if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
###### - 1 Timothy 2:15 (YLT)

The Child-bearing is not what you think...

## A Model for the Ordination of Women

Keller is clear that she believes women will never be permitted to serve in authoritative roles. 
I disagree with her, but also with many of her opponents. Agreeing with Keller, I accept the following propositions:

  - The Bible has not been tampered with and its words can be trusted.
  - The Apostle Paul did not speak in error or out of malice or misogyny.
  - Jesus' death and resurrection did not immediately qualify women to serve as pastors and elders, or Paul would have said so.
  - Paul's limitations in 1 Timothy and Ephesians were not just because of a few disorderly women, they were universal in scope, covering all churches in his era.
  - The Scripture passages forming the legal basis regulating which men may become pastors and elders still apply only to men.

Reading my above concessions to Keller's logic one might assume there is no alternative to the complementarian view.
Rather, it defines constraints that must be satisfied if another solution to the puzzle is to be found. 
After studying what the Bible has to say about ordaining people for service, some patterns are clear.
The seeker or the community offer a sacrifice. They hold a special ceremony of ordination. 
God directly or through a prophet defines the rights and responsibilities of the position.
And something is established about how to pass the baton to the next generation, such as regulations about 
hereditary offices or matters of character and wisdom.
These patterns and the constraints guide us to the questions we must answer, namely statements we must find in the Bible
and reall events we must find in history.
Only if we can answer these questions and point to these events can we assert that the Bible sanctions women serving in these roles.
Here is what we must find:

1. The actual offering of a special sacrifice for ordination
2. A Bible story about a ceremony of ordination
3. A prophetic metaphor in that Bible story that proves that the ceremony applies to women
4. A prophetic framework for time that tells us when the ordination occurred
5. A clear connection between that story and the challenging passages in 1&2 Timothy and Ephesians 5 that fairly reinterprets those texts
6. An explanation for why the wait had to be so long, God’s purpose for women’s suffering even after the Cross
7. Personal testimony demonstrating that I was guided to these ideas through supernatural means via the Holy Spirit

I have already partly addressed the seventh point, so the rest of this article will tackle the first six.
It is time to find a Biblical model for the ordination of women.

## Submission: The Sacrifice of Long-suffering Christian Women

When a Christian suffers but holds onto their faith, God endows them with spiritual power. So it has been with women.

In my books I share the story of Janet Sullivan. Pastor Larry urged the congregation to visit an ailing church member
who lived in a nursing facility.
I had suffered for a decade from depression so I was determined not to visit her. 
Didn't I have enough problems of my own? After numerous appeals from the pulpit, I relented.
It seems that she lived a block from my apartment in Somerville. Nobody else in the church lived anywhere near her.
I was her neighbor. So one morning, on my way to church, I visited her, gave her a cassette of Christian music,
prayed for her and read to her from the Bible. I was there maybe fifteen minutes.
After I left, I began to sob. I had never seen anyone in such pain. I never before cried so hard for somebody 
besides myself. Then after a half hour of walking, as I reached the BU Bridge, a miracle. 
My soul was flooded with joy. It stayed for a week. I doubt that any day this side of heaven I will every experience
so much joy again. After meeting Janet, I was permanently delivered from my depression.

Six months later, Janet Sullivan died. At her funeral, another mourner said something with which we all agreed. 

#### "When you were with Janet it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."

The best analogy that I can think of is how the breaking of a jar of perfume fills the whole house with fragrance.
That was Janet. Even near death, she shared her faith with visiting family, friends and strangers. She never let 
go of God and He never let go of her. Apart from the person who led me to Christ, no one has had as big an impact
on my life as a frail woman with rheumatoid arthritis with only months left to live.

Her suffering produced a harvest of righteousness. Her suffering came to an end. 
How many women down the centuries have held onto their faith in Jesus, suffered and died?
Shall their collective suffering not eventually complete the sacrifice for their daughter's ceremony of ordination?
Has it not been reached already?

Before modern times, few things terrified women more than childbirth. As noted earlier, one in eight women died bearing children.
It is with good reason that Paul used that allusion in his letter to Timothy. 

#### But **she** will be saved by **The Childbearing**, 
#### if **they** continue in faith 
#### and love 
#### and holiness 
#### with sound-mindedness.
###### - 1 Timothy 2:15 YLT (Young’s Literal Translation)

The construction is peculiar. It is not "childbearing" but "The Childbearing". 
This speaks of a special event. 

  - It is not the birth of Jesus, as that was already in the past, and this event was in the future. 
  - It is also not a reference to normal childbirth, as "she" will be saved by what "they" do. The ones having the child are a "they", a group of women.
  - The references to faith, love, holiness and sound-mindedness as well as the ordeal of bearing a child speak of a sacrifice.

My interpretation (in part) is as follows:

  - Christian Women were instructed to make great sacrifices for the faith.
  - This would prepare them and the church for an event called The Childbearing.
  - The event would save later women from the trials the earlier women once endured and the oppression they once suffered.
  - This sacrifice would be a sacrifice of ordination, qualifying women to serve as pastors and elders.
  
So what is The Childbearing?

When did it happen?

Where in the Bible is it hidden?

Let’s back up and consider the varieties of ordination for service...

## Consecration: Models of Ordination

The Bible offers several models for ordination. They confer an honor given by God, not men.

#### For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act
#### on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices
#### for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, 
#### since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this 
#### he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as 
#### he does for those of the people. 
#### **And no one takes this honor for himself, but only**
#### **when called by God, just as Aaron was**. 
###### Hebrews 5:1-4, ESV

Here are some models for ordination of which I am aware:

  - The Order of Melchizedek
  - The Levitical Priesthood (defined in Leviticus)
  - The Aaronic Priesthood (defined in Leviticus)
  - The Apostles
  - Male Pastors and Elders (defined by Paul)

The first applies only to Jesus (and the original Melchizedek, as a type).
Hebrews 7:11-16 tells us how Jesus qualifies. It is *by the power of an indestructible life*.

The next two are hereditary, only for Jews, and only for men.

The age of the Apostles has passed.

This leave only pastors and elders as defined by Paul, and by the regulations he gives,
this is only open to men.

The Book of Hebrews devotes a lot of space to Jesus as belonging to the Order of Melchizedek.
In the middle of this, the writer uses a marvelous feminine analogy:

#### For though by this time you ought to be teachers, 
#### you need someone to teach you again the basic principles 
#### of the oracles of God. You need **milk,** not **solid food,** 
#### for everyone who lives on **milk** is unskilled in 
#### the word of righteousness, since he is a **child.** 
###### Hebrews 5:12-13, ESV

This analogy talks about the mature getting past the time when they need to drink
their mother's milk. If there is an event called "The Childbearing", 
then perhaps there is additional development past that to get to a mature faith
and become qualified to lead in the church? We shall see. Between 1 Timothy and Hebrews,
we have these two analogies related to the role of women in bearing and raising children.
Could they be pointing us to a part of the Bible rich in feminine analogies that
we can use to interpret their deeper meaning?

Before we see about that, we still have not found a suitable model for the ordination of women.
Are there any other models we have overlooked?

Yes! We have the ordination of Job.

Chronologically, the first mention of a priest in the Bible (other than a pagan one) was Melchizedek.
The second was Job. Here are the steps whereby Job became a priest:

  1. **Sacrifice**. Job offered many sacrifices. One was to continue to praise God despite his suffering. The second was to let go of his thirst for vengeance.
  2. **Ordination**. God officiated the ceremony. He authorized Job's service without any intermediary.
  3. **Regulations**. God described the rituals of animal sacrifice to be followed by the friends.
  4. **Scope of Authority**. God authorized Job to forgive his friends' sins and endorsed Job's words about himself.

Here is part of Job's story:

#### After the Lord had spoken these words to Job, the Lord said 
#### to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My anger burns against you and 
#### against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me 
#### what is right, as my servant Job has. Now therefore take 
#### seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and 
#### offer up a **burnt offering** for yourselves. And my servant Job 
#### shall pray for you, for **I will accept his prayer**
#### **not to deal with you according to your folly**. 
#### For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” 
#### So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite 
#### went and did what the Lord had told them, and **the Lord accepted Job's prayer.**
###### - Job 42:7-9

Chronologically, Job is the first person in the Bible explicitly authorized to forgive the sins of others. (The remit of Melchizedek is fuzzy.)
The friends' burnt offering is significant. Such an offering was used in many Levitical ceremonies, including the original ordination 
of Aaron's sons in Leviticus:

#### And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands 
#### of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the Lord. 
#### Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar 
#### with the **burnt offering**. This was an **ordination offering** 
#### with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the Lord.
###### - Leviticus 8:27-28

How important is the ordination of Job to be a priest?

  - The Book of Job is likely the first Bible book written.
  - Job 29 is the central chapter of the Old Testament. Thus Job is close to God’s heart and his ordination as priest is foundational.
  - Job ends with a startling change:
  
#### And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, 
#### and the name of the second Keziah, 
#### and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
#### And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. 
#### And **their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers**. 
###### - Job 42:14-15, ESV

This is the earliest and one of the strongest declarations of equality between the sexes in the Bible.

Can we apply Job’s model of Ordination to Women? Yes!

## Identification: The Metaphor of Childbirth

How do we connect the Book of Job to women? 

  - First, Job is part of a larger group of seven books, the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The names of the books are Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. These seven books share common structural and thematic patterns. The words and actions of several women in these books are relevant to the subject of ordination, so their presence in one of the pillar books connects them to Job. Those women are Lady Wisdom, the Wife of Noble Character, King Lemuel's mother, the bride in Song of Songs and Hannah, mother of the prophet Samuel. (Hannah appears in 1 Samuel, which is not a pillar book. However, Hannah is the one who prophesies the existence of the seven pillars.)

### Lady Wisdom

The book of Proverbs describes a scene that may be related to the ordination of women:

#### Wisdom has built her house;
##### she has hewn her **seven pillars.**
#### She has **slaughtered her beasts**;  
##### she has mixed her **wine;**
###### she has also set her **table.**
#### She has sent out her young women to call
#### from the highest places in the town,
##### “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
##### To him who lacks sense she says,
###### “Come, **eat of my bread**
###### and **drink of the wine** I have mixed. 
###### - Proverbs 9:1-5, ESV

  - **Observation**: Lady Wisdom’s offering of bread and wine imitates the Christian ritual of communion.
  - **Conclusion**: Women are permitted to serve communion.
  
The slaughtering of beasts, which figuratively is the destruction of evil empires, is the burnt offering of the ordination sacrifice.
The seven pillars which are named by Solomon were first hinted at in the prayer of a woman who made a great sacrifice: her first born son.

### Hannah

Hannah dedicated her firstborn son, Samuel, to serve the Lord.
To Honor her sacrifice, God put a prophecy on her lips.
Her prayer prophesies the existence of the seven pillars of wisdom a century before Solomon wrote of them.
Hannah's prayer includes seven reversals of fortune, some of which concern women.
These seven reversals conform to seven themes expressed by Solomon in Ecclesiastes 3 in his poem of the twenty-eight times of life.
Each quartet of times in the poem describes one phase of life.
The seven themes are the seven phases of life that a person goes through to get from birth to full maturity.
In the quoted passage, I have added those themes.

#### **SECURITY (Birth to Age 7)**:
##### The bows of the mighty are broken, 
###### but the feeble bind on strength.
#### **ABILITY** (Ages 7 to 14):
##### Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, 
###### but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.
#### **STABILITY** (Ages 14 to 21)
##### **The barren has borne seven,** 
###### but she who has many children is **forlorn.**
#### **AMITY** (Ages 21 to 28):
##### The Lord kills and brings to life; 
###### he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
#### **OPPORTUNITY** (Ages 28 to 35): 
##### The Lord makes poor and makes rich; 
###### he brings low and he exalts.
#### **COMMUNITY** (Ages 35 to 42):
##### He raises up the poor from the dust; 
###### he lifts the needy from the ash heap
##### to make them sit with princes 
###### and inherit a seat of honor.
#### **INTERLUDE** :
##### **For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's,**
###### and on them he has set the world.
#### **LOYALTY** (Ages 42 to 49): 
##### He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, 
###### but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, 
###### for not by might shall a man prevail.
##### The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; 
###### against them he will thunder in heaven.
#### **CONCLUSION**: 
##### The Lord will judge the ends of the earth; 
###### he will give strength to his king 
###### and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
###### - 1 Samuel 2:4-10, ESV

Hannah reveals the seven pillars in two ways. 

  - First, she shows seven reversals.
  - Second, she splits the identification of the pillars into two statements. "The barren has borne seven" numbers the pillars. Several verses later, she names "the pillars of the earth".

In my book *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, I connect each time of life to a 120 year period. 
The clock started in 960 BC, with the dedication of Solomon's temple.
Thus each phase lasts 480 years. The stability phase (for gaining verbal and physical self control during the teen years) ran from 1 to 480 AD. 
It was near the end of this time that the final removal of woman from church leadership as elders and even communion servers occurred. 
The verse speaks of a barren woman bearing children. A pregnant woman is confined; she cannot do all the work she once did until the baby is delivered.
The end of the stability phase is the latter part of the teen years, when girls got married. Thus the historical era of stability saw the beginning of
women's confinement, but a confinement that would eventually end.

The next time of interest is the phase of community. The poor and needy are raised up to places of honor.
The corresponding time in history was 1440 to 1920 AD. At the end of this time women began to be educated in schools, 
received the right to own their own property, became missionaries, and a few became pastors.
The last year of the era, 1920 AD, was when women in the US earned the right to vote.
Truly, women were lifted up.

The four times of the community phase were crucial for women:

  - a time to tear was when the baby was delivered
  - a time to mend was when women began to heal from their pregnancy
  - a time to be silent was when women began to be educated in large numbers
  - a time to speak was the misisonary age, 1800 to 1920 AD, when women were sent out with men to speak the gospel in foreign lands.
