title: Against Complementarianism
---
In early 2024, the booklet *Jesus, Justice & Gender Roles* by Kathy Keller (published in 2012)
was circulated in my church. Keller advocates for a complementarian approach to
church leadership. The author claims that the Bible teaches that women may not serve as pastors or elders
in churches, but may serve in all other capacities. This article will not critique the whole booklet, 
but focus on three weaknesses in her argument. Exploiting those three weaknesses, it will offer ideas to 
support the opposing view of egalitarianism. But first, a little about why I hold the views that I do.

## Declaration Against Interest

In law, there is a principle known as *declaration against interest*. By this principle, 
hearsay testimony by a person who holds a stake in the opposite view is considered highly credible.
For example, if a man testifies to something that will cause him to lose reputation, money,
or to be charged with a crime himself because of his testimony, he will be believed and his words accepted
in court. I am offering such testimony. I am admitting that for most of my life, I was wrong.

I once wholeheartedly accepted the complementarian view. I even left a church when it changed from being 
complementarian to egalitarian. This cost me friends. I held to varying strains of this philosophy 
from the time I became a Christian in April 1985 until I became persuaded
of the opposite opinion in December 2020. Why? Was it because of peer pressure or to win the favor
of others? Was it because I am easily swayed or lazy and do not carefully study both sides of an argument?

I have held and continue to hold many political and religious views that are mocked or considered 
repugnant by the people of my liberal state, such as being pro-life, opposed to same sex marriage,
or believing that God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days
not more than seven thousand years ago.

I have lost friends and strained relationships many times on account of such views.
My job was once threatened by a project leader at a management consultant company because
I refused to work on the sabbath. Neither then nor during the decades since have I have backed down on 
my commitment to sabbath observance. Therefore, it is not because of peer pressure, social ostracism,
or a desire to win the favor of anyone that I changed my opinion about this. 
Nor did any person confront me with a new book or better logic. 
Instead, I was confronted by two things: my sin and my ignorance.

I was studying world history in the light of the Bible, trying to see from Scripture God's unfolding
plan over the millennia for the ending of many evils, like religious intolerance, slavery, racism, 
and colonialism. Suddenly, I was struck that nowhere in my research had I derived any results concerning God's 
plan for the liberation of women from oppression. The damning realization was not that I had
not found God's plan. My sin was that I had not even asked the question! All my curiosity at
poring over millennia of history to understand God's ways and I had no curiosity about
the Almighty's great concern for his daughters and how he was determined to show it.

I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "Lord, what is your plan for the liberation of women 
from opporession?" Over the course of the next week, I pored over the Bible. God's glory
entered my mind and illuminated passages and ideas that I had either never seen before or discounted
and downplayed. I did a complete 180. I now believe that I was not only factually wrong, 
I was spiritually deaf to what God has to say about such things. I was not just ignorant, but culpable.

And God is forgiving.
