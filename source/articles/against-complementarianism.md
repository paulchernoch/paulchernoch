title: Against Complementarianism
---
In early 2024, the booklet *Jesus, Justice & Gender Roles* by Kathy Keller (published in 2012)
was circulated in my church. Keller advocates for a complementarian approach to
church leadership. The author claims that the Bible teaches that women may not serve as pastors or elders
in churches, but may serve in all other capacities. This article will not critique the whole booklet, 
but focus on three weaknesses in her argument. Exploiting those three weaknesses, it will offer ideas to 
support the opposing view of egalitarianism. But first, a little about why I hold the views that I do.

## Declaration Against Interest

In law, there is a principle known as *declaration against interest*. By this principle, 
hearsay testimony by a person who holds a stake in the opposite view is considered highly credible.
For example, if a man testifies to something that will cause him to lose reputation, money,
or to be charged with a crime himself because of his testimony, he will be believed and his words accepted
in court. I am offering such testimony. I am admitting that for most of my life, I was wrong.

I once wholeheartedly accepted the complementarian view. I even left a church when it changed from being 
complementarian to egalitarian. This cost me friends. I held to varying strains of this philosophy 
from the time I became a Christian in April 1985 until I became persuaded
of the opposite opinion in December 2020. Why? Was it because of peer pressure or to win the favor
of others? Was it because I am easily swayed or lazy and do not carefully study both sides of an argument?

I have held and continue to hold many political and religious views that are mocked or considered 
repugnant by the people of my liberal state, such as being pro-life, opposed to same sex marriage,
or believing that God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days
not more than seven thousand years ago.

I have lost friends and strained relationships many times on account of such views.
My job was once threatened by a project leader at a management consultant company because
I refused to work on the sabbath. Neither then nor during the decades since have I have backed down on 
my commitment to sabbath observance. Therefore, it is not because of peer pressure, social ostracism,
or a desire to win the favor of anyone that I changed my opinion about this. 
Nor did any person confront me with a new book or better logic. 
Instead, I was confronted by two things: my sin and my ignorance.

I was studying world history in the light of the Bible, trying to see from Scripture God's unfolding
plan over the millennia for the ending of many evils, like religious intolerance, slavery, racism, 
and colonialism. Suddenly, I was struck that nowhere in my research had I derived any results concerning God's 
plan for the liberation of women from oppression. The damning realization was not that I had
not found God's plan. My sin was that I had not even asked the question! All my curiosity at
poring over millennia of history to understand God's ways and I had no curiosity about
the Almighty's great concern for his daughters and how he was determined to show it.
My lack of empathy was a grave sin.

I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "Lord, what is your plan for the liberation of women 
from opporession?" Over the course of the next week, I pored over the Bible. God's glory
entered my mind and illuminated passages and ideas that I had either never seen before or discounted
and downplayed. I did a complete 180. I now believe that I was not only factually wrong, 
I was spiritually deaf to what God has to say about such things. I was not just ignorant, but culpable.

And God is forgiving.

## The Three Errors of Kathy Keller

Keller's book is concise and well-written. She offers excellent exegesis of passages that demolish 
the more extreme views of churches who place even more restrictions upon women than she advocates.
Without her penetrating logic, I would have overlooked critical holes in my own argument.
I owe her a debt because I would have overlooked a key aspect of the most wonderful Biblical evidence
in favor of egalitarianism, the need for a Biblical model of ordination that applies to women. 
Before we get to that, here are the errors that I spotted. I will collect the quotes up front, 
then address each in turn.

#### "What is clear in the Bible interprets what is cloudy." 
###### - Page 12

#### "Why did God arrange things this way, 
#### with a gender-based division of labor?" 
#### At the end of the day, I still don't know.
###### - Page 29

#### "... and your life takes on meaning and matures
#### when you conform to God's will, not when
#### you get to do what you want to do."
###### - Page 32

**Perspicacity**. The first quote argues for the perspicacity of Scripture. The main things are the plain things
and the plain things are the main things. It is a fruitful attitude to hold when approaching
the more confusing passages of the Bible. However, is it universally applicable?
Can God's plan for women vis-a-vis leadership in the church be understood from the clear passages
alone? Consider Solomon's words:
 
#### It is the glory of God to conceal things, 
##### but the glory of kings is to search things out.
###### - Proverbs 25:2

Then recall the story of Cornelius, Peter and the acceptance of the Gentiles into the church.
The Old Testament is filled with promises of God's desire to spread his message to all peoples, not just the Jews.
Not until Peter's vision of being permitted to eat unclean animals did the church accept this
"obvious" truth. It is not the clear words that govern the meaning, it is the defining passages
that do so. The defining passages for a topic can then be used to deal with the special cases.
Sometimes the Holy Spirit must illuminate a formerly unrecognized defining passage so that its
teaching may be applied to the unclear verses elsewhere. In a while I will show that there
is a defining portion of the Bible that tackles the issue of God's plan for women and it has 
been overlooked by the church.

**Purpose**. With the second quote, Keller admits **ignorance** as to God's purposes concerning 
the restrictions upon women. Such humility is a good start. However, what if knowing the very thing 
of which she claims ignorance is essential if we are to arrive at a true and just understanding? 
There are two ways to understand this: a fact or an attitude. As a fact, it is a statement that 
the Lord has not revealed this information. As an attitude, it is a resistance to looking for that 
answer, persevering until you have it, and then forming your conclusions.

We know that God has revealed this information about why women are suffering because He promised
that He would tell it to us. Keller's problem is that she is close to charging God with breaking that promise. 

#### Is a trumpet blown in a city,
##### and the people are not afraid?
#### Does disaster come to a city,
##### unless the Lord has done it?

#### For the Lord God does nothing
##### without revealing his secret
###### to his servants the prophets.
###### - Amos 3:6-7

What was the first breach in human relationships?

What problem affects half of humanity?

Of all the trials afflicting the world, which by its very magnitude and longevity 
screams loudest for a solution with the possible exception of mortality itself?

If ANY plan of God's to address ANY evil in the world deserves to be spelled out
in Scripture, the plan to relieve the suffering of women is that plan.
Surely the purpose behind the suffering of women is integral to the purpose behind God's plan.

Years ago, a man gave a talk at Ruggles Baptist Church. He shared his ideas about
Revelation. Revelation is filled with plagues. I asked the speaker why God chose the 
particular plagues that He did. What was the purpose behind each plague? He said he didn't know.
I figured that if he didn't know why, he really didn't know. 

Since Keller admits she doesn't know why, she really doesn't know.

I know why. I don't know everything about the why, but I learned something about it.
I learned enough about the WHY to also know the WHEN. The WHEN is when God began to permit 
women to serve as pastors and elders. We will get to that soon.

In progress...
