title: Against Complementarianism
---
In early 2024, the booklet *Jesus, Justice & Gender Roles* by Kathy Keller (published in 2012)
was circulated in my church. Keller advocates for a complementarian approach to
church leadership. The author claims that the Bible teaches that women may not serve as pastors or elders
in churches, but may serve in all other capacities. This article will not critique the whole booklet, 
but focus on three weaknesses in her argument. Exploiting those three weaknesses, it will offer ideas to 
support the opposing view of egalitarianism. But first, a little about why I hold the views that I do.

## Declaration Against Interest

In law, there is a principle known as *declaration against interest*. By this principle, 
hearsay testimony by a person who holds a stake in the opposite view is considered highly credible.
For example, if a man testifies to something that will cause him to lose reputation, money,
or to be charged with a crime himself because of his testimony, he will be believed and his words accepted
in court. I am offering such testimony. I am admitting that for most of my life, I was wrong.

I once wholeheartedly accepted the complementarian view. I even left a church when it changed from being 
complementarian to egalitarian. This cost me friends. I held to varying strains of this philosophy 
from the time I became a Christian in April 1985 until I became persuaded
of the opposite opinion in December 2020. Why? Was it because of peer pressure or to win the favor
of others? Was it because I am easily swayed or lazy and do not carefully study both sides of an argument?

I have held and continue to hold many political and religious views that are mocked or considered 
repugnant by the people of my liberal state, such as being pro-life, opposed to same sex marriage,
or believing that God created the heavens and the earth in six literal days
not more than seven thousand years ago.

I have lost friends and strained relationships many times on account of such views.
My job was once threatened by a project leader at a management consultant company because
I refused to work on the sabbath. Neither then nor during the decades since have I have backed down on 
my commitment to sabbath observance. Therefore, it is not because of peer pressure, social ostracism,
or a desire to win the favor of anyone that I changed my opinion about this. 
Nor did any person confront me with a new book or better logic. 
Instead, I was confronted by two things: my sin and my ignorance.

I was studying world history in the light of the Bible, trying to see from Scripture God's unfolding
plan over the millennia for the ending of many evils, like religious intolerance, slavery, racism, 
and colonialism. Suddenly, I was struck that nowhere in my research had I derived any results concerning God's 
plan for the liberation of women from oppression. The damning realization was not that I had
not found God's plan. My sin was that I had not even asked the question! All my curiosity at
poring over millennia of history to understand God's ways and I had no curiosity about
the Almighty's great concern for his daughters and how he was determined to show it.
My lack of empathy was a grave sin.

I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "Lord, what is your plan for the liberation of women 
from oppression?" Over the course of the next week, I pored over the Bible. God's glory
entered my mind and illuminated passages and ideas that I had either never seen before or discounted
and downplayed. I did a complete 180. I now believe that I was not only factually wrong, 
I was spiritually deaf to what God has to say about such things. I was not just ignorant, but culpable.

And God is forgiving.

## The Three Errors of Kathy Keller

Keller's book is concise and well-written. She offers excellent exegesis of passages that demolish 
the more extreme views of churches who place even more restrictions upon women than she advocates.
Without her penetrating logic, I would have overlooked critical holes in my own argument.
I owe her a debt because I would have overlooked a key aspect of the most wonderful Biblical evidence
in favor of egalitarianism, the need for a Biblical model of ordination that applies to women. 
Before we get to that, here are the errors that I spotted. I will collect the quotes up front, 
then address each in turn.

#### "What is clear in the Bible interprets what is cloudy." 
###### - Page 12

#### "Why did God arrange things this way, 
#### with a gender-based division of labor?" 
#### At the end of the day, I still don't know.
###### - Page 29

#### "... and your life takes on meaning and matures
#### when you conform to God's will, not when
#### you get to do what you want to do."
###### - Page 32

**Perspicacity**. The first quote argues for the perspicacity of Scripture. The main things are the plain things
and the plain things are the main things. It is a fruitful attitude to hold when approaching
the more confusing passages of the Bible. However, is it universally applicable?
Can God's plan for women vis-a-vis leadership in the church be understood from the clear passages
alone? Consider Solomon's words:
 
#### It is the glory of God to conceal things, 
##### but the glory of kings is to search things out.
###### - Proverbs 25:2

Reflect on Solomon's words. **This is a glory issue.** It is not clear. It must be searched out.

Recall the story in the Book of Acts about Cornelius, Peter and the acceptance of the Gentiles into the church.
The Old Testament is filled with promises of God's desire to spread his message to all peoples, not just the Jews.
Not until Peter's vision of being permitted to eat unclean animals did the church accept this
"obvious" truth. It is not the clear words that govern the meaning, it is the defining passages
that do so. The defining passages for a topic can then be used to deal with the special cases.
Sometimes the Holy Spirit must illuminate a formerly unrecognized defining passage so that its
teaching may be applied to the unclear verses elsewhere. In a while I will show that there
is a defining portion of the Bible that tackles the issue of God's plan for women and it has 
been overlooked by the church.

**Purpose**. With the second quote, Keller admits **ignorance** as to God's purposes concerning 
the restrictions upon women. Such humility is a good start. However, what if knowing the very thing 
of which she claims ignorance is essential if we are to arrive at a true and just understanding? 
There are two ways to read this: as a fact or as an attitude. As a fact, it is a statement that 
the Lord has not revealed this information. As an attitude, it is a resistance to looking for that 
answer, persevering until you have it, and then forming your conclusions.

#### **Q:** Has God has revealed to us this information about why women are suffering? 
#### **A:** Yes. 

#### **Q:** How do we know? 
#### **A:** We know because He promised that He would tell it to us. 

#### **Q:** Where is the promise? 
#### **A:** In the Book of Amos.

Keller's problem is that she is close to charging God with breaking that promise. 

#### Is a trumpet blown in a city,
##### and the people are not afraid?
#### Does disaster come to a city,
##### unless the Lord has done it?

#### For the Lord God does nothing
##### without revealing his secret
###### to his servants the prophets.
###### - Amos 3:6-7

What was the first breach in human relationships?

What problem affects half of humanity?

Of all the trials afflicting the world, which by its very magnitude and longevity 
screams loudest for a solution with the possible exception of mortality itself?

If ANY plan of God's to address ANY evil in the world deserves to be spelled out
in Scripture, the plan to relieve the suffering of women is that plan.
Surely the purpose behind the suffering of women is integral to the purpose behind God's plan.

Years ago, a man gave a talk at Ruggles Baptist Church. He shared his ideas about
Revelation. Revelation is filled with plagues. I asked the speaker why God chose the 
particular plagues that He did. What was the purpose behind each plague? He said he didn't know.
I figured that if he didn't know why, he really didn't know. 

Since Keller admits she doesn't know why, she really doesn't know.

I know why. I don't know *everything* about the why, but I learned *something* about it.
I learned enough about the WHY to also know the WHEN. The WHEN is when God began to permit 
women to serve as pastors and elders.

Why should there be a when? Why not have women endure this until the end? 
The reason is found in Isaiah. Even if we do not know the cause for suffering, 
we can know that it will end.

#### **Does he who plows for sowing plow continually?**
##### Does he continually open and harrow his ground?
#### When he has leveled its surface,
##### does he not scatter dill, sow cumin,
#### and put in wheat in rows
##### and barley in its proper place,
##### and emmer as the border?
#### For he is rightly instructed;
##### his God teaches him.
###### - Isaiah 28:24-26

The prophet tells us that you don't plow forever. Eventually you plant, the seed grows, 
and you reap a harvest. Plowing is used in Scripture as a metaphor for suffering, as in 
Psalms 129 and 141, as well as Job 1. The plowing of the wicked may not end, but not the 
plowing of the righteous. 

**This is a sacrifice issue**. No suffering ordained by God for our good is without 
purpose or an end date.

**Hearing**. In the third quote, the Keller accuses women of pursuing these offices so
they can "get to do what \[they\] want to do". I doubt that women are different from men
when it comes to their capacity for pride and presumption. I will apply Keller's charge to myself.

From 1989 to 1993, I passionately pursued oversea missionary service until the mission board, 
Pastor Larry, and finally my own reluctant spirit said no, I was not called.

Around that time I also pursued studies at seminary until it became clear to me 
that I was not called to the pastorate. I wept bitterly.

Only after another decade passed did the Lord begin to guide me into my calling, in the area 
of Christian writing.

I was a proud, impulsive, multi-talented MIT graduate passionately set on pursuing a course
that God had not ordained and yet I heard the voice of the Holy Spirit when he said, "No!" 
I heard and obeyed with tears. Are not godly women equally capable of hearing a "No!" from God?
Or a "Yes"?

**This is a spiritual hearing issue.**

## The Three Errors, Synthesized

The three errors fall into three complementary categories that touch on the three principle aspects 
of a person: the mind, the heart and the hand.

  - The windows to the *mind* are your *ears*. They let God's truth in.

  - The windows to the *heart* are your *eyes*. They let God's glory in.

  - The door from the soul to the *world* is your *hands*. By them your actions speak your purposes, priorities and plans to the world and to God.

Keller said women cannot clearly **hear** from God concerning their calling. 
She herself did not **see** the glory of the hidden words that Solomon urged us to seek out, words that
free women to lead. And she dismisses as inadequate the collective sacrifice offered by the **hands** of Christian women
down through the centuries. Abraham paid a tenth to Melchizedek. In American Colonial times, 
one in eight women died in childbirth, and by many other measures they devoted themselves to
the work handed to them. What more sacrifice is needed?

The three categories above are not chosen as a rhetorical device. Jesus alluded to them in his parable
about the sower and the seed. 

  - The **seed** snatched by the bird is the knowledge of the gospel targeted at your **ears**. Trampled earth represents our deaf ears.
  - The **rocky soil** is the **heart** that shuts out the glory of God shining from the sun. It needs the water of the Holy Spirit to survive, like tears of repentance to wash the dust from our eyes.
  - The **thorny soil** is the **hand** that won't give. Its priorities are selfish, its habits dissolute, and its sacrifices made for show. It needs to have those clingy weeds pulled up and those thorns pruned, to mourn the loss of worthless things and find things of eternal value.

Keller is a well-educated, dedicated Christian with long experience in Christian ministry. Who am I to challenge her?
Where do I get the audacity to say that I understand these things better? I get it from making the same mistakes that she made
and having God turn me around. Here are my credentials:

**Hearing.** In January 2005, I lost all hearing in my left ear. A month of steroids and trips to the doctor did nothing. 
At the end of one doctor visit, I went into the waiting room and pulled out my Bible and a card with a yearly Bible reading plan.
The plan told me to open to Exodus 4, where God is speaking to Moses from the burning bush. This is what I read:

#### Then the Lord said to him, 
##### “Who has made man's mouth? 
##### Who makes him mute, or **deaf**, or seeing, or blind? 
##### Is it not I, the Lord? 
##### Now therefore go, and **I will be with your mouth**
##### **and teach you what you shall speak**.”
###### - Exodus 4:11-12

That is the only place in the Bible that says that God makes people deaf. As I read those words, I knew God was in the room with me.
He knew why I was deaf and it was part of his plan. I accepted it in peace and stopped praying for healing.
Two days later, my hearing returned. By these words from God, I received a sobering message. I was spiritually deaf.
I also received a promise. The Lord would open my spiritual ears so that I could learn the things that he would teach me.

That was why, years later, I was able to ask the Lord about his plan for freeing women from oppression and hear an answer that
contradicted what I believed.

**Seeing.** Around 2012, reflecting on Moses again, I realized that he knew something that I did not: what is of ultimate value.
A conversation between Moses and God in Exodus shows us what Moses desired to see above everything else in all creation.

#### Moses said, “Please show me your glory.” 
###### - Exodus 33:18

God's glory was what Moses' eyes longed most to see. My priorities were different. What did I do about it? I prayed.
For the next three years I fasted each Monday, and repeated the same simple prayer: "Lord, show me your glory."
During the time of my fast I saw no visions, had no dreams, and experienced no miracles, yet when I concluded my fast,
I knew that I had been heard. A year later, I began to see the world differently. I lost my job and a few days later, 
my mother died. Though out of work and with no savings, my first thought was to help my father in his time of sorrow. 
I took him on a vacation to New York City to visit his relatives and the city of his birth. Then I stayed with him
in the hospital for weeks when he almost died of anaplasmosis. All this time I was at peace. A year after that, 
the Lord began to open up the Scriptures to me, starting with Job. He was showing me His glory through His Word. 
My studies of Job eventually led me to revise my ideas about women in leadership, among other things.

**Touching.** There is no specific connection between my miraculous recovery of hearing, my prayer to see God's glory,
and receiving wisdom about God's plan for women in ministry. When someone challenged me a couple years ago
by asking something along the lines of "Why would God choose you to tell these things?", I had no answer.
Only while reflecting on Keller's book did the answer finally come to me. It is with our hands that we offer
our sacrifices to God. Some sacrifices we make willingly. Others are involuntary. They spring from the sufferings of life.
The latter provoke deep mourning. Just as women have made both kinds of offering, so have I.

*First, the suffering*. Around 2003, I dreamt that while driving my family in our car, a tornado caught us up.
We were lifted up, then came crashing down. This repeated too many times to count: up, down, up, down. 
Then the storm ended and we drove on in safety. Days later, a visiting preacher at the International Family Church
spoke about Jesus calming the storm. He said that the reason Jesus guided the disciples into the storm was not 
primarily to teach them faith. They entered the storm so that they could reach the other side of the lake.
Two demon-possessed men were waiting there, in desperate need of a savior.

The conjunction of dream and sermon told me that God was about to thrust my family and I into a long storm but that 
it would eventually come to an end and we would move on in safety. The imagery of a whirlwind would one day 
guide me to study Job. And like my hearing loss less than two years later, I was being told that on the other side of the
storm there would be something fruitful for me to do.

This nearly two decade long period of suffering gave me empathy for women who fear that their suffering has no end.
All suffering has an end. The suffering of the faithful also has a noble purpose. I am convinced that what
God made plain to me is also true of women. They were subjected to a long trial, but it is over and we should acknowledge that.

*Second, the sacrifice*. When I was in my late twenties, I was foolish with money. I made one really bad decision and the Lord
spoke to me sternly in a dream, warning me to reverse my decision, which warning I heeded. Some months later, I 
came into a sum of money. Knowing that I could not trust myself to make wise use of the money, I prayed. I asked the Lord
to let me know what I should do with the money. In my prayer, I named the exact amount: eight thousand dollars.
At the time, this was more that half of all I owned in this world.

Days later, I attended a prayer meeting. One person at the meeting said that a Christian charity for which she volunteered
had an urgent need. The amount of that need was exactly eight thousand dollars.

Days later, I went to Pastor Larry and asked him to pray with me, to decide if it was really the Lord's will.
I was a willing but not so cheerful giver. Then I made arrangements to give the money anonymously, because
Jesus warned us about making big gestures to gain the approval of men. After I made this sacrifice, I searched my
heart and did not like how hard it was for me to obey. In the Bible, when many people offered God a sacrifice they also
made a petition. What did I ask God for? I prayed, "Lord, give me a generous heart."

It was a generous heart that I would one day need if I was to expend months of study, writing and prayer for the benefit of women.
So why did God answer my prayer by directing me to study what His word says about this particular subject?
Why shine a light on His care for the suffering of women?
It was because the money that I donated, most of what I owned, was to a crisis pregnancy center. And so the Lord taught me the meaning of 
these words of Saint Paul:

#### and she shall be saved through **the child-bearing**, 
##### if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
###### - 1 Timothy 2:15 (YLT)

The Child-bearing is not what you think...

## A Model for the Ordination of Women

Keller is clear that she believes women will never be permitted to serve in authoritative roles. 
I disagree with her, but also with many of her opponents. Agreeing with Keller, I accept the following propositions:

  - The Bible has not been tampered with and its words can be trusted.
  - The Apostle Paul did not speak in error or out of malice or misogyny.
  - Jesus' death and resurrection did not immediately qualify women to serve as pastors and elders, or Paul would have said so.
  - Paul's limitations in 1 Timothy and Ephesians were not just because of a few disorderly women, they were universal in scope, covering all churches in his era.
  - The Scripture passages forming the legal basis regulating which men may become pastors and elders still apply only to men.

Reading my above concessions to Keller's logic one might assume there is no alternative to the complementarian view.
Rather, it defines constraints that must be satisfied if another solution to the puzzle is to be found. 
After studying what the Bible has to say about ordaining people for service, some patterns are clear.
The seeker or the community offer a sacrifice. They hold a special ceremony of ordination. 
God directly or through a prophet defines the rights and responsibilities of the position.
And something is established about how to pass the baton to the next generation, such as regulations about 
hereditary offices or matters of character and wisdom.
These patterns and the constraints guide us to the questions we must answer, namely statements we must find in the Bible
and real events we must find in history.
Only if we can answer these questions and point to these events can we assert that the Bible sanctions women serving in these roles.
Here is what we must find:

1. The actual offering of a special sacrifice for ordination
2. A Bible story about a ceremony of ordination
3. A prophetic metaphor in that Bible story that proves that the ceremony applies to women
4. A prophetic framework for time that tells us when the ordination occurred
5. A clear connection between that story and the challenging passages in 1&2 Timothy and Ephesians 5 that fairly reinterprets those texts
6. An explanation for why the wait had to be so long, God’s purpose for women’s suffering even after the Cross
7. Personal testimony demonstrating that I was guided to these ideas through supernatural means via the Holy Spirit

I have already partly addressed the seventh point, so the rest of this article will tackle the first six.
It is time to find a Biblical model for the ordination of women.

## Submission: The Sacrifice of Long-suffering Christian Women

When a Christian suffers but holds onto their faith, God endows them with spiritual power. So it has been with women.

In my books I share the story of Janet Sullivan. Pastor Larry urged the congregation to visit an ailing church member
who lived in a nursing facility.
I had suffered for a decade from depression so I was determined not to visit her. 
Didn't I have enough problems of my own? After numerous appeals from the pulpit, I relented.
It seems that she lived a block from my apartment in Somerville. Nobody else in the church lived anywhere near her.
I was her neighbor. So one morning, on my way to church, I visited her, gave her a cassette of Christian music,
prayed for her and read to her from the Bible. I was there maybe fifteen minutes.
After I left, I began to sob. I had never seen anyone in such pain. I never before cried so hard for somebody 
besides myself. Then after a half hour of walking, as I reached the BU Bridge, a miracle. 
My soul was flooded with joy. It stayed for a week. I doubt that any day this side of heaven I will every experience
so much joy again. After meeting Janet, I was permanently delivered from my depression.

Six months later, Janet Sullivan died. At her funeral, another mourner said something with which we all agreed. 

#### "When you were with Janet it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."

The best analogy that I can think of is how the breaking of a jar of perfume fills the whole house with fragrance.
That was Janet. Even near death, she shared her faith with visiting family, friends and strangers. She never let 
go of God and He never let go of her. Apart from the person who led me to Christ, no one has had as big an impact
on my life as a frail woman with rheumatoid arthritis with only months left to live.

Her suffering produced a harvest of righteousness. Her suffering came to an end. 
How many women down the centuries have held onto their faith in Jesus, suffered and died?
Shall their collective suffering not eventually complete the sacrifice for their daughter's ceremony of ordination?
Has it not been reached already?

Before modern times, few things terrified women more than childbirth. As noted earlier, one in eight women died bearing children.
It is with good reason that Paul used that allusion in his letter to Timothy. 

#### But **she** will be saved by **The Childbearing**, 
#### if **they** continue in faith 
#### and love 
#### and holiness 
#### with sound-mindedness.
###### - 1 Timothy 2:15 YLT (Young’s Literal Translation)

The construction is peculiar. It is not "childbearing" but "The Childbearing". 
This speaks of a special event. 

  - It is not the birth of Jesus, as that was already in the past, and this event was in the future. 
  - It is also not a reference to normal childbirth, as "she" will be saved by what "they" do. The ones having the child are a "they", a group of women.
  - The references to faith, love, holiness and sound-mindedness as well as the ordeal of bearing a child speak of a sacrifice.

My interpretation (in part) is as follows:

  - Christian Women were instructed to make great sacrifices for the faith.
  - This would prepare them and the church for an event called The Childbearing.
  - The event would save later women from the trials the earlier women once endured and the oppression they once suffered.
  - This sacrifice would be a sacrifice of ordination, qualifying women to serve as pastors and elders.
  
So what is The Childbearing?

When did it happen?

Where in the Bible is it hidden?

Let’s back up and consider the varieties of ordination for service...

## Consecration: Models of Ordination

The Bible offers several models for ordination. They confer an honor given by God, not men.

#### For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act
#### on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices
#### for sins. He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, 
#### since he himself is beset with weakness. Because of this 
#### he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as 
#### he does for those of the people. 
#### **And no one takes this honor for himself, but only**
#### **when called by God, just as Aaron was**. 
###### Hebrews 5:1-4, ESV

Here are some models for ordination of which I am aware:

  - The Order of Melchizedek
  - The Levitical Priesthood (defined in Leviticus)
  - The Aaronic Priesthood (defined in Leviticus)
  - The Apostles
  - Male Pastors and Elders (defined by Paul)

The first applies only to Jesus (and the original Melchizedek, as a type).
Hebrews 7:11-16 tells us how Jesus qualifies. It is *by the power of an indestructible life*.

The next two are hereditary, only for Jews, and only for men.

The age of the Apostles has passed.

This leave only pastors and elders as defined by Paul, and by the regulations he gives,
this is only open to men.

The Book of Hebrews devotes a lot of space to Jesus as belonging to the Order of Melchizedek.
In the middle of this, the writer uses a marvelous feminine analogy:

#### For though by this time you ought to be teachers, 
#### you need someone to teach you again the basic principles 
#### of the oracles of God. You need **milk,** not **solid food,** 
#### for everyone who lives on **milk** is unskilled in 
#### the word of righteousness, since he is a **child.** 
###### Hebrews 5:12-13, ESV

This analogy talks about the mature getting past the time when they need to drink
their mother's milk. If there is an event called "The Childbearing", 
then perhaps there is additional development past that to get to a mature faith
and become qualified to lead in the church? We shall see. Between 1 Timothy and Hebrews,
we have these two analogies related to the role of women in bearing and raising children.
Could they be pointing us to a part of the Bible rich in feminine analogies that
we can use to interpret their deeper meaning?

Before we see about that, we still have not found a suitable model for the ordination of women.
Are there any other models we have overlooked?

Yes! We have the ordination of Job.

Chronologically, the first mention of a priest in the Bible (other than a pagan one) was Melchizedek.
The second was Job. Here are the steps whereby Job became a priest:

  1. **Sacrifice**. Job offered many sacrifices. One was to continue to praise God despite his suffering. The second was to let go of his thirst for vengeance.
  2. **Ordination**. God officiated the ceremony. He authorized Job's service without any intermediary.
  3. **Regulations**. God described the rituals of animal sacrifice to be followed by the friends.
  4. **Scope of Authority**. God authorized Job to forgive his friends' sins and endorsed Job's words about himself.

Here is part of Job's story:

#### After the Lord had spoken these words to Job, the Lord said 
#### to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My anger burns against you and 
#### against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me 
#### what is right, as my servant Job has. Now therefore take 
#### seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and 
#### offer up a **burnt offering** for yourselves. And my servant Job 
#### shall pray for you, for **I will accept his prayer**
#### **not to deal with you according to your folly**. 
#### For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” 
#### So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite 
#### went and did what the Lord had told them, and **the Lord accepted Job's prayer.**
###### - Job 42:7-9

Chronologically, Job is the first person in the Bible explicitly authorized to forgive the sins of others. (The remit of Melchizedek is fuzzy.)
The friends' burnt offering is significant. Such an offering was used in many Levitical ceremonies, including the original ordination 
of Aaron's sons in Leviticus:

#### And he put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands 
#### of his sons and waved them as a wave offering before the Lord. 
#### Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar 
#### with the **burnt offering**. This was an **ordination offering** 
#### with a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the Lord.
###### - Leviticus 8:27-28

How important is the ordination of Job to be a priest?

  - The Book of Job is likely the first Bible book written.
  - Job 29 is the central chapter of the Old Testament. Thus Job is close to God’s heart and his ordination as priest is foundational.
  - Job ends with a startling change:
  
#### And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, 
#### and the name of the second Keziah, 
#### and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 
#### And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. 
#### And **their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers**. 
###### - Job 42:14-15, ESV

This is the earliest and one of the strongest declarations of equality between the sexes in the Bible.

Can we apply Job’s model of Ordination to Women? Yes!

## Identification: The Metaphor of Childbirth

How do we connect the Book of Job to women? 

  First, Job is part of a larger group of seven books, the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The names of the books are Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. These seven books share common structural and thematic patterns. The words and actions of several women in these books are relevant to the subject of ordination, so their presence in one of the pillar books connects them to Job. Those women are Lady Wisdom, the Wife of Noble Character, King Lemuel's mother, the bride in Song of Songs and Hannah, mother of the prophet Samuel. (Hannah appears in 1 Samuel, which is not a pillar book. However, Hannah is the one who prophesies the existence of the seven pillars.)

### Lady Wisdom

The book of Proverbs describes a scene that may be related to the ordination of women:

#### Wisdom has built her house;
##### she has hewn her **seven pillars.**
#### She has **slaughtered her beasts**;  
##### she has mixed her **wine;**
###### she has also set her **table.**
#### She has sent out her young women to call
#### from the highest places in the town,
##### “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
##### To him who lacks sense she says,
###### “Come, **eat of my bread**
###### and **drink of the wine** I have mixed. 
###### - Proverbs 9:1-5, ESV

  - **Observation**: Lady Wisdom’s offering of bread and wine imitates the Christian ritual of communion.
  - **Conclusion**: Women are permitted to serve communion.
  
The slaughtering of beasts, which figuratively is the destruction of evil empires, is the burnt offering of the ordination sacrifice.
The seven pillars which are named by Solomon were first hinted at in the prayer of a woman who made a great sacrifice: her first born son.

### Hannah

Hannah dedicated her firstborn son, Samuel, to serve the Lord.
To Honor her sacrifice, God put a prophecy on her lips.
Her prayer prophesies the existence of the seven pillars of wisdom a century before Solomon wrote of them.
Hannah's prayer includes seven reversals of fortune, some of which concern women.
These seven reversals conform to seven themes expressed by Solomon in Ecclesiastes 3 in his poem of the twenty-eight times of life.
Each quartet of times in the poem describes one phase of life.
The seven themes are the seven phases of life that a person goes through to get from birth to full maturity.
In the quoted passage, I have added those themes.

#### **SECURITY** (Birth to Age 7):
##### The bows of the mighty are broken, 
###### but the feeble bind on strength.
#### **ABILITY** (Ages 7 to 14):
##### Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, 
###### but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger.
#### **STABILITY** (Ages 14 to 21)
##### **The barren has borne seven,** 
###### but she who has many children is **forlorn.**
#### **AMITY** (Ages 21 to 28):
##### The Lord kills and brings to life; 
###### he brings down to Sheol and raises up.
#### **OPPORTUNITY** (Ages 28 to 35): 
##### The Lord makes poor and makes rich; 
###### he brings low and he exalts.
#### **COMMUNITY** (Ages 35 to 42):
##### He raises up the poor from the dust; 
###### he lifts the needy from the ash heap
##### to make them sit with princes 
###### and inherit a seat of honor.
#### **INTERLUDE** :
##### **For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's,**
###### and on them he has set the world.
#### **LOYALTY** (Ages 42 to 49): 
##### He will guard the feet of his faithful ones, 
###### but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness, 
###### for not by might shall a man prevail.
##### The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; 
###### against them he will thunder in heaven.
#### **CONCLUSION**: 
##### The Lord will judge the ends of the earth; 
###### he will give strength to his king 
###### and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
###### - 1 Samuel 2:4-10, ESV

Hannah reveals the seven pillars in two ways. 

  - First, she shows seven reversals.
  - Second, she splits the identification of the pillars into two statements. "The barren has borne seven" numbers the pillars. Several verses later, she names "the pillars of the earth".

In my book *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, I connect each time of life to a 120 year period. 
The clock started in 960 BC, with the dedication of Solomon's temple.
Thus each phase lasts 480 years. The stability phase (for gaining verbal and physical self control during the teen years) ran from 1 to 480 AD. 
It was near the end of this time that the final removal of woman from church leadership as elders and even communion servers occurred. 
The verse speaks of a barren woman bearing children. A pregnant woman is confined; she cannot do all the work she once did until the baby is delivered.
The end of the stability phase is the latter part of the teen years, when girls got married. Thus the historical era of stability saw the beginning of
women's confinement, but a confinement that would eventually end.

The next time of interest is the phase of community. The poor and needy are raised up to places of honor.
The corresponding time in history was 1440 to 1920 AD. At the end of this time women began to be educated in schools, 
received the right to own their own property, became missionaries, and a few became pastors.
The last year of the era, 1920 AD, was when women in the US earned the right to vote.
Truly, women were lifted up.

The four times of the community phase were crucial for women:

  - a time to tear was when the baby was delivered
  - a time to mend was when women began to heal from their pregnancy
  - a time to be silent was when women began to be educated in large numbers
  - a time to speak was the missionary age, 1800 to 1920 AD, when women were sent out with men to speak the gospel in foreign lands.

### More Women!

Just as women are being liberated as we near the end of history, so the ends of the books that constitute the seven pillars
also show the progress of women.

**Proverbs**. The final chapter, Proverbs 31, includes a mention of King Lemuel's mother, who taught him the wise sayings that he included in his chapter.
 She was a teacher of men. The chapter concludes with the description of a wife of noble character. 
 Such a woman buys and sells property, creates and sells goods at market and is worthy of respect. 
 She is described in terms that show she is the equal of any man.

**Psalms**. The last mention of women in the Psalms is in Psalm 144. 

#### May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, 
##### our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace...
###### - Psalm 144:12

By describing the daughters as palace pillars, the Bible both extols not just their beauty but also their strength and wisdom,
by connecting them to the pillars of wisdom.

The most significant reference to women in the Psalms is in Psalm 68:

#### The Lord gives the word;
##### the women who announce the news are a great host:
##### “The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!”
##### The women at home divide the spoil—
###### though you men lie among the sheepfolds—
##### the wings of a dove covered with silver,
###### its pinions with shimmering gold.
##### When the Almighty scatters kings there,
###### let snow fall on Zalmon.
###### - Psalm 68:11-14, ESV

In this psalm, the men are lazy and the women industrious. The men are cowards and the women, courageous.
It is a mighty throng of women who broadcast the news of the gospel, fight the battle, and scatter the kings of the earth.
Think about that...

**Song of Songs**. The main character is a woman to whom many come for advice. She tells them not to arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
This was a prophecy of "a time for love". It has been during our current era, "a time for love", 
that women have made the greatest strides towards equality.

**Matthew**. It is women who first see Jesus and report his resurrection. Yet there is another amazing event that is overlooked by people 
studying this gospel, the story of Jesus sending for a donkey to ride into Jerusalem.

#### Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethpage, 
#### to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 
#### saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, 
#### and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. 
#### Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, 
#### you shall say, 
##### ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” 
#### This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
##### “Say to the daughter of Zion,
###### ‘Behold, your king is coming to you,
##### humble, and mounted on a donkey,
###### on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’”
###### - Matthew 21:1-5

Jesus is telling them that the daughter of Zion will be set free!
In *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, I show how each of Matthew's twenty-eight chapters corresponds to a different one of Solomon's times, in order.
This chapter of Matthew, chapter 21, corresponds to the twenty-first time, "a time to tear". The time of tearing is the time when 
a woman gives birth and is set free from her burden.

Why use a donkey as an image? Women were treated like beasts of burden, so that fits, but there is a deeper reason.
In Job 39, God speaks about his care for his animals. This is what he says about the donkey:

#### “Who has let the wild donkey go free?
##### Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
#### to whom I have given the arid plain for his home
##### and the salt land for his dwelling place?
#### He scorns the tumult of the city;
##### he hears not the shouts of the driver.
#### He ranges the mountains as his pasture,
##### and he searches after every green thing.
###### - Job 39:5-8

God sets the donkey free! In my books, I argue that Job 39 corresponds to "a time for love".
Again, "a time for love" began in 1920 AD with women getting the right to vote.
Then in 1921, women in Louisiana gained the right to sit on a jury, followed soon by the other states.

Matthew 21 has one more surprise:

#### But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things
####  that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, 
##### “Hosanna to the Son of David!” 
#### they were indignant, and they said to him, 
##### “Do you hear what these are saying?” 
#### And Jesus said to them, 
##### “Yes; have you never read,
###### “‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies
###### you have prepared praise’?”
###### - Matthew 21:15-16

Again, the Bible draws our attention to infants and nursing babies. There is surely a message about God's plan for women hidden here.

**Revelation**. In two of my books I show how the locusts with women's hair in Revelation 9 are Christian queens, sent to oppress the ungodly.
That prophecy was fulfilled by Queen Victoria of England, Maria Theresa of Austria, and the women Tsars of Russia, like Catherine and Anna, to name a few.
And of course, the final scene in Revelation is the wedding supper of the lamb, where the bride has made herself ready.

### Job at Last!

This brings us to Job. Like the other pillars, this book ends with Job's daughters being exalted. 
At the start of the story, his first daughters visited their brothers' houses to celebrate. That means that they did not have houses of their own.
His three new daughters now receive an equal share in the inheritance with their brothers. This shows a change in Job.
This also has God on record as demanding equality between men and women in the first book of the Bible to be written.
Equality was not an afterthought!
We learn the daughters' names but not the names of their brothers. In the Bible, which names many men but fewer women, this is a huge reversal.
 
However, the Book of Job has much more to say about women than a footnote about his daughters' excellencies.
In fact, the Book of Job contains more feminine analogies than any other book in the Bible. 
If you are like me, my early thoughts on seeing references to women in Job were that his suffering was being compared
to the suffering of women as a simple analogy. He suffered *like* a woman. He had no reputation, no authority and no property *like* a woman.
It is not that way. The tragedies of women's lives are more than literary turns of phrase to be exploited in a clever poem. 
This book is many things:

  1. a true story about the suffering of a righteous man
  2. a parable about the sufferings of the Christ (as I show in my book *Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*)
  3. a parable of the suffering of the Jewish people
  4. a prophecy of the suffering of women throughout history and their redemption.

I wrote a whole book about Job and never noticed the fourth. I didn't spot it until last year. 
It is one of the hidden things of God that need to be searched out. Let's begin by looking at words.

**Feminine Analogies in Job**

The word **womb** is found more times in Job than any other book of the Bible. It is not the only word related to the
life experiences of women to be found here. When I at last decided to look and for the first time saw how often these words occur in Job,
my eyes were opened. The book is pregnant with them!

 - Womb (10) Most of any book in the Bible
 - Woman (7), Women (2)
 - Wife (3)
 - Conceive(d) (2)
 - Labor (of childbirth) (1)
 - Born (8) including a “born of woman” reference to Jesus in Job 25
 - Birth (8)
 - Begotten (1)
 - Delivered (of childbirth) (1), Deliver(s,ed) (from evil & suffering) (7)
 - Breast(s) (2), Nursed (1)
 - Mountain goats and does calving
 - Firstborn (1)
 - Child(ren) (15), Infants (1), Offspring (3)
 - Daughter(s) (6)
 - Son(s) (18)
 - Mother(s) (3)
 - Barren (3), Stillborn (1), Childless (1)
 - Widow(s) (7)
 - Fatherless (8)
 - Total = 122

In addition to direct words, there are clever turns of phrase. In Job 1, the troubles begin when the oxen are plowing.
Plowing with oxen is figure of speech that can mean having sex and conceiving. Remember Samson, who posed a riddle to the 
Philistines, only to have them cheat by getting his wife to cajole the answer out of him?

#### And he said to them, 
##### “If you had not plowed with my heifer, 
##### you would not have found out my riddle.”
###### - Judges 14:18b

One more analogy is significant. In Job 32:19, Elihu says, "Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst."
That is a clever way to speak about a woman's water getting ready to break. Elihu was Job's spiritual midwife,
to ensure that the wisdom God was forming in Job would come to term and not be stillborn, with Job giving up in despair, 
cursing His Maker and losing his reward, his baby.

See God's love for women? He doesn't just care about whether they can give him children. 

  - He care about widows. 
  - He cares about women who can't have babies.
  - He cares about the stillborn and the devastated woman whose hopes were dashed. 
  - He cares about the fatherless, because that means that there is a single mother struggling to make ends meet.
  - And the Lord stands by women as they watch their children grow up and move away, a bittersweet time, as related in Job 39.

And in the person of Job's wife, you have the caretaker, overwhelmed by the burden of caring for a sick husband after she 
also lost her ten children, her property, and her respect in the community.

The words alone should get the message across, but there is more.

**Weeks and Months**

I spent years deducing the structures of Job. It has more than one, each making a different point.
Somehow I missed a big one. The whole book maps out, week by week, month by month, the course of a woman's pregnancy.
The words and phrases paint a **qualitative** picture of a pregnant woman. The structure makes it **quantitative**.

To begin, how long does an average pregnancy last? Today it ranges from 276 to 285 days, depending on measurement method. 
Forty (40) weeks is thus an accurate definition for the length of a pregnancy.
Hmmm. In the Bible, forty is a number that signifies suffering, like:

  - the forty days and nights of rain in the flood
  - Jesus being tempted in the desert by Satan for forty days
  - the Jews wandering in the desert for forty years

After a woman gives birth, there is a laying-in period, a time to rest and heal from the birth. 
This typically lasts two to three weeks.

Thus the whole of a pregnancy plus the laying-in period lasts forty-two weeks.

There are forty-two chapters in Job! Coincidence? No! What does God say in Job 39?

#### “Do you know when the mountain goats give birth?
##### Do you observe the calving of the does?
#### **Can you number the months that they fulfill**,
##### and do you know the time when they give birth,
#### when they crouch, bring forth their offspring,
##### and are delivered of their young?
###### - Job 39:1-3

In her thirty-ninth week, don't you think that women are counting the days until it is all over?
Well God is right there alongside her, counting those days with just as much anticipation!

The same analysis can be done to count the months.

  - A half month for conception, chapters 1 & 2
  - Nine speeches by Job, for the nine full months of pregnancy
  - Elihu as midwife and God as expectant Father there for the delivery and post-partum period

All the major aspects of a woman bearing a child and giving birth are present and slotted into the right chapters:

  - Chapter 1, the plowing, is the time of conception. Chapters one and two are the first two weeks of pregnancy.
  - Chapter 3 has Job's first big speech. He spends most of it talking about not wishing he was born, speaks of his mother nursing him, and generally focuses his words on the analogy of childbirth, cementing it as the key theme of the book
  - The bulk of the book is a back and forth between Job's friends, who say hurtful lies, and Job, who looks to God for help. This alternation of good and bad symbolizes the labor pains.
  - The last words from one of the friends specifically addresses birth, when Bildad says in Job 25:
#### How then can man be in the right before God?
#### How can he who is **born** of woman be pure?
  - Elihu arrives to serve as midwife. 
  - When Elihu talks about being a wineskin about to burst, that is the water ready to break. 
  - Elihu announces the arrival of God in Job 37, which symbolizes the arrival of the baby.
  - But what if the baby is stillborn, arriving too early in week 38, cold as ice? God even shows his care for women who endure this horror:
#### From whose womb did the ice come forth,
##### and who has given birth to the frost of heaven? 
###### - Job 38:29, ESV
  - God in chapter 39 speaks tenderly about caring for pregnant animals and counts the days until delivery.
  - Job 40 shows God as a proud papa, boasting about his baby Behemoth. It is like God is saying, "My kid will be the strongest kid ever born! Nobody can touch him!"
#### “He is the first of the works of God;
##### let him who made him bring near his sword!"
  - Job recovers his health in chapter 42, the end of the laying-in period. 
  - His family members bring gifts, like people do to celebrate the birth of a child.
  
At the end of Job, the narrative traces out the family's future, which speaks of new generations to be born:

#### And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, 
##### and his sons' sons, four generations.
#### And Job died, an old man, and full of days.
###### - Job 42:16-17

One curiousity is the words day and days, which occur 52 times in Job, suggesting the weeks in a full year, symbolizing time.

When you get to the end, what is the full set of blessings that Job (and his daughters) received?
Now compare it to the blessing that women have received in the last few centuries:

  - Improved Health
  - Long life
  - Antibiotics and blood transfusions in mid 20th century reduced death in childbirth by more than fifty-fold.
  - Wealth
  - Property rights (to the daughters)
  - restored Family relationships
  - Honor in the community
  - A priestly calling
  - Ability to read the Word of God.

This last one, the Word of God, is vital. Job prayed one of the most powerful prayers ever prayed in all of history.

#### **“Oh that my words were written!**
##### **Oh that they were inscribed in a book!**
#### **Oh that with an iron pen and lead**
##### **they were engraved in the rock forever!**
#### For I know that my Redeemer lives,
##### and at the last he will stand upon the earth.
#### And after my skin has been thus destroyed,
##### yet in my flesh I shall see God,
#### whom I shall see for myself,
##### and my eyes shall behold, and not another.
#### My heart faints within me!
###### - Job 19:23-27

Job’s prayer created the Bible! His was the first Bible book written down. He declared that God can raise the dead.
During medieval times women were prevented from doing many things, but one thing was not denied them.

Women were permitted to be scribes and copy Bibles. Medieval nuns were active in preserving and transmitting 
the Word of God to future generations. That is because those women knew that their redeemer lives and would
eventually save them, too.

It is now incontestable that the book of Job has a deep, prophetic message for women.
Since the whole of the book concerns women, surely the ordination that Job received
was also promised to them. But when?

It is time to tie Job's prophecy of the Childbearing down to history.

## Quantification:

Timing is everything. Say that God does have a plan to permit women to become pastors and elders. 
What difference does it make to today's women if that planned event remains in the future?
We need more than verses that say He will permit it. We need to nail the prophesies down to a specific time
and that time must be in our past.

In *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, I derived a framework for prophecy that covers the books of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
It also extends to select other Bible prophecies. That framework is defined in Ecclesiastes. It follows the 
twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3. Those times describe both the practical and the prophetic:

  - **Practical**. Solomon enumerates the seven phases of human life from birth to full maturity.
  - **Prophetic**. The seven phases are a parable for the development of civilization, from Solomon until Christ's return.
  
### Time to Get Practical

Solomon in Ecclesiastes divides a life into three parts in a way that is identical for men and women.

  1. Ascending Years (birth to age 49) Ecclesiastes 1:1-10:5
  2. Productive Years (age 50 to 61) Ecclesiastes 10:6-11:6
  3. Declining Years (age 62 to death) Ecclesiastes 11:7-12:14
   
For the ascending years, there is a seven-phase pattern for men which I call the **Growth Pattern**. Each phase of life covers four times and lasts seven years:

  1. **Security** (birth to age 7). A time to be born & die, to plant & uproot. The needs are for food, shelter, health and parental love.
  2. **Ability** (age 7 to 14). A time to kill & heal, to break down & build. The needs are to be trained to use mind and hand productively.
  3. **Stability** (age 14 to 21). A time to weep & laugh, to mourn & dance. The needs are to learn verbal & physical self control, emotional stability.
  4. **Amity** (age 21 to 28). A time to scatter & gather stones, embrace & refrain. The needs are to cooperate in friendship and marriage in the areas of work and intimacy, to choose and reject relationships wisely.
  5. **Opportunity** (age 28 to 35). A time to seek & lose, keep & throw away. The needs are to accept or reject immaterial opportunities (where to live and work) and to manage material resources (money and goods).
  6. **Community** (age 35 to 42). A time to tear & mend, to be silent & speak. The needs are to handle conflict, dissolve partnerships, forgive & restore them, and maintain open, two-way lines of communication.
  7. **Loyalty** (age 42 to 49). A time to love & hate, for war & peace. The need is to develop loyalty and express it. Love & hate are about defining our loyalties and forming loyal attitudes: who is on my side and who is on the other side. War & peace are about expressing our loyalties by our actions.
   
There is a second pattern for women, which I call the **Motherhood Pattern**. It matches the pattern for men, except for the times from dancing to mending, the years of bearing children:

  - The time to mourn is marriage.
  - The time to dance is getting pregnant.
  - The times from scattering stones to throwing away are the time of Confinement during a woman's many pregnancies and years caring for children.
  - The time to tear is birth.
  - The time to mend is the laying-in recovery period.
  - The time to be silent is when women receive instruction and their life pattern rejoins the pattern for men.
  - The time to speak is when women are finally permitted to speak.
  
The “times of confinement” are 9 ½ times for pregnancy plus one for recovery:

  - Dance (½): Conception occurs halfway through this time
  - Scatter, gather, embrace, refrain: Early pregnancy
  - Seek, give up, keep, throw away: Late Pregnancy
  - Tear: Delivery
  - Mend: For recovery

That equals (10.5 / 12) * 7 years = 18.375 years, or roughly ages 19 to 38.

Between the Growth Pattern and the Motherhood Pattern, Ecclesiastes shows that God planned out the phases of our life with care.
Our days are ordered and given a unique purpose. The differences between men and women are also accounted for.
As crucial as the differences are, the pattern also shows the similarities. After the childbearing and rearing years, a woman's
life pattern as defined by God rejoins the pattern for men from which it diverged. This is thus a parable for the coming of a time
when men and women are equal.

### Time to Get Prophetic

The Seven Pillars are prophetic and precise, like a clock. Jesus and the prophets used ordinary stories to teach spiritual lessons
and offer prophetic advice. The concrete allusions each had a special, spiritual meaning. The twenty-eight times in Solomon's poem 
are thus a parable for all of human history. My books show that (like a fractal) the parable has multiple applications at different 
scales of time:

  - From Creation until Christ's Return, showing the rise and permanent fall of human civilization
  - From the Dedication of Solomon's Temple until Christ's return, showing the growth to full maturity of Israel and the Church
  - From the Holocaust to Christ's return, showing the growth to full maturity of the modern nation of Israel

We shall concern ourselves with the second trajectory, as it is the primary application of the pattern in the Bible.
The logical progression I followed in my book is as follows:

  - Solomon defines the Growth pattern and applies it to individuals
  - Solomon poses a riddle in Ecclesiastes that tells us how long each time lasts and when the clock begins
  - The bulk of Ecclesiastes is divided into twenty-eight parts of unequal length, using the phrase "under the sun" to divide sections
  - Each part of Ecclesiastes therefore matches one of the twenty-eight times
  - Many of these sections in Ecclesiastes contain prophesies related thematically to the corresponding time phrase...
  - ... and prophetically to events in history
  - With those prophecies proving the accuracy of the framework, we proceed to the other books in the Seven Pillars
  - The other six pillar books are Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Matthew and Revelation
  - The remaining pillar books have part or all of the book divisible into twenty-eight parts according to various structural markers, excepting Revelation
  - Having matched sections of each book to one of the twenty-eight times thematically, we conclude that the section also matches temporally
  - With each chapter or section of the pillar books so divided into a time grid, we can slot prophecies given in those chapters or passages to eras in history 

Here is how the twenty-eight times map to sections of each book:

  - **Psalms A**: Each verse of Psalm 102 (which has twenty-eight verses) matches its corresponding time
  - **Psalms B**: Psalms 1-28 match their corresponding time, with three intentional exceptions, as given in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. 
  - **Job**: Chapters 15-42 match successive times from Ecclesiastes
  - **Proverbs**: Chapters 4-31 match successive times from Ecclesiastes. The first three chapters are an introduction.
  - **Song of Songs**: The book has twenty-eight speaking parts. About half match their corresponding time. Fifteen match the opposite time of what is appropriate. This signifies how young people in love are so impatient and governed by emotion that they almost always pick the wrong time to do things.
  - **Matthew**: Each of Matthew's twenty-eight chapters matches its corresponding time.
  - **Revelation**: This book is different. It is broken into seven parts, not twenty-eight, one for each phase of four times. Each section ends with a reference to thunder.

**Prolepsis: That's too complicated!**

The universal reaction I get to these ideas is that there is no way God would make things so complicated as what I am describing. 
Let me ask you:

  - Have you ever seen the blueprints for a nuclear reactor?
  - Have you ever seen the data flow and sequence diagrams for an enterprise software application?
  - Have you ever seen my manager's planning calendar?
  - Would you even consider answering the questions God posed to Job without differential equations, laws of gravity and electricity, fluid dynamics, or population genetics?

Millions (maybe billions) of people key their lives into calendar applications like Outlook or Teams. 
They mark up spiral bound paper planners or dog and cat calendars posted on their fridge. 
They plan out their lives day by day, month by month, year by year.
All I am saying is that God speaks to us in ways to which we can relate. 

  - God broke His work of saving the world into seven categories.
  - He divided His activities into those seven categories.
  - He created a separate ledger for each category, the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
  - He divided time into equal increments, like a planner.
  - He sorted his activities by time.
  - He slotted each activity into its proper time period on each calendar.
  - He wrote out his first draft of a complete plan for the salvation of the righteous and judgment of the wicked.
  - Then He came up with a special set of code words.
  - Then He encrypted the event descriptions, making them into parables using the code words.
  - And He threw away the year and month markers.
  - And He distributed parts of the answer key throughout the Bible.
  - And He threw away the chapter and verse boundaries.
  - Lastly, he oversaw the process of translating it into Greek, then Latin, then Old English, then Elizabethan English, and finally modern English so that we could read it today.

It is the work of the church to recover the original message so that we can plan our lives, plan the work of the church, 
understand God's will and find weapons to use against the enemy.

  - Jewish scholars added back the verse boundaries to the Old Testament.
  - Christian scholars added back the verse boundaries to the New Testament.
  - A Christian scholar added back the chapter divisions. (Called by most scholars "uninspired", but the evidence is mounting that they were sovereignly determined and prophetically significant.)
  - Many Jewish and Christian scholars have labored long to deduce the meaning of the code words.

In this process, I have been doing this:

  - adding to the set of decoded words and phrases
  - using pattern recognition techniques to identify the planning ledgers (the Seven Pillars of Wisdom)
  - identifying the categories associated with each ledger
  - finding portions of the decryption key
  - recovering the time grid so that each "page" of each planner can be dated
  - comparing the rediscovered times to historical events to decode the prophecies
  - discovering the larger trends and so clarifying and constraining the meaning of each prophecy
  - applying the time grid to other books of the Bible where warranted

In high school, the first thing I did every morning when I arrived was to go to the school library, get the latest Schenectady Gazette,
and solve the Daily Cryptoquote puzzle. It was a single substitution cypher. If you cracked the code you were rewarded with a clever quote
from a poet, philosopher or public figure. In my work, I developed a high speed computer algorithm for the unassisted classification of data
with thousands of attributes per record. This is the kind of problem I was made for.

**Back to the Clock**

The main clock in Ecclesiastes starts with the dedication of Solomon’s temple in 960 BC.
It follows the history of Israel and the Church. In my two most recent books, I work out a complex riddle
in Ecclesiastes which gives us the duration of each era as 120 years. 
Here then is how we can match Solomon's words to history:

By matching the above to chapters 15 thru 42 of Job, we can anchor Job's prophecies in time.
By this, we now know when “The Childbearing” occurred, which is "a time to tear", or 1440-1560 AD.

**The Childbearing is the Protestant Reformation and the dawn of a new civilization.**

Here are a selection of prophecies from Job, matching the time bounds to chapters in Job:

*Job 18, 600-480 BC, A time to uproot, Babylonian Exile*

#### He is **torn from the tent** in which he trusted 
##### and is brought to the king of terrors.
#### In his tent dwells that which is none of his; 
##### sulfur is scattered over his habitation.
#### His **roots dry up** beneath,
##### and his **branches wither** above.
#### His memory perishes from the earth,
##### and he has no name in the street. 
###### - Job 18:14-17

Who was the King of terrors? King Nebuchadnezzar. The uprooting of plants and trees is the dominant metaphor used in scores 
of Old Testament prophecies to describe the coming exile.  

*Job 20, 360-240 BC, A time to Heal, Death of Alexander the Great*

As Revelation 13 reveals, Satan controls the beasts of the world, its evil empires. That means that Satan controlled the empire of Alexander, 
one of the beasts and one of the heads of Daniel’s visions. The devil is full of hatred, even for his servants. 
Job 20 is Satan’s *epitaphios logos*, his funeral oration, for the fallen “Lord of Asia”, the “Great King” and “Son of Zeus”. 
In the case of Alexander the Great, we have the unusual situation that he was attended by doctors and their notes
about his medical condition were preserved by secular historians down through the ages, such as Flavius Arrianus, 
Ptolemy, Plutarch, and Quintus Curtius. Because of that, we can match his known symptoms to the prophecy of Job with precision.
Here then are the profound connections between Job 20 (from the NIV) and the death of Alexander:

#### Verse 5. **“... the mirth of the wicked is brief, 
#### the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.”** 
Alexander fell ill during the merriment of a banquet.

#### Verse 6. “**Though the pride of the godless person 
#### reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds...**” 
Though a man, he pursued and accepted divine honors and titles, just as Satan sought the throne of heaven.

#### Verse 7. “**he will perish forever, like his own dung; 
#### those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’**” 
The word dung brings to mind the diarrhea that beset him.

#### Verse 8. “**Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, 
#### banished like a vision of the night.**” 
Delirium and hallucinations seized him.

#### Verses 9-10. “**The eye that saw him will not see him again; 
##### his place will look on him no more. 
#### His children must make amends to the poor; 
##### his own hands must give back his wealth.**” 
After Alexander died, his generals, called the Diadochi, fought each other to seize his title and kingdom. One was Cassander, who ordered the execution of Alexander’s wife Roxane and his sons Heracles and Alexander IV and usurped the throne of Macedon. Wikipedia says this of Cassander. “It was later even said that he could not pass a statue of Alexander without feeling faint.” Truly the one who took his place did not want look on him any more. Among those who contend that Alexander was poisoned, Cassander is their prime suspect.

#### Verse 11. “**The youthful vigor that fills his bones 
#### will lie with him in the dust.**” 
Alexander died young.

#### Verses 12-14. “**Though evil is sweet in his mouth and 
##### he hides it under his tongue, 
#### though he cannot bear to let it go and 
##### lets it linger in his mouth, 
#### yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; 
##### it will become the venom of serpents within him.**” 
The first symptoms were excruciating stomach pain. Yet despite the travails of the first day of his illness, Alexander attended another banquet the next day. He could not bear to let his pleasures go.

#### Verse 15. “**He will spit out the riches he swallowed; 
##### God will make his stomach vomit them up.**” 
His doctors induced vomiting.

#### Verse 16. “**He will suck the poison of serpents; 
##### the fangs of an adder will kill him**.” 
There is no mention of real snakes in the historical record. This may refer to medicines that his doctors gave him that worsened his condition, or metaphorically to the supernatural agent contributing to his death: Satan.

#### Verse 17. “**He will not enjoy the streams, 
##### the rivers flowing with honey and cream.**” 
His corpse was encased in a sarcophagus filled with honey! (Honey deters the decomposition of dead bodies.)

#### Verse 18. “**What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; 
##### he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.**” 
Alexander eventually lost his appetite. Metaphorically, it means he never enjoyed ruling over the empire he conquered.

#### Verse 20. “**Surely he will have no respite from his craving; 
##### he cannot save himself by his treasure.**” 
Alexander suffered an unquenchable thirst.

#### Verses 22-23. “**In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; 
##### the full force of misery will come upon him. 
#### When he has filled his belly, 
##### God will vent his burning anger against him 
###### and rain down his blows on him.**” 
This describes the start of his anguish, when he filled his belly with food and wine. The full force of misery struck his belly first. Reports indicated that if anyone touched his midsection gently it caused sharp pain. This also identifies the second, more substantial spiritual agent of Alexander’s destruction: God.

#### Verses 24-26. “**Though he flees from an iron weapon, 
##### a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him. 
#### He pulls it out of his back, 
##### the gleaming point out of his liver. 
#### Terrors will come over him; 
##### total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. 
#### A fire unfanned will consume him and 
##### devour what is left in his tent.**” 
Though doctors say his symptoms do not indicate cirrhosis as the cause of death, Alexander was a heavy drinker, and drank to excess the first two days of his illness, which may have injured his liver and weakened his body’s ability to fight off disease. Reports of his symptoms include jaundice, indicating liver failure.

There is no mistaking the “fire unfanned”; persistent high fever plagued him until he met his end. Also, recall how Plutarch described the initial pain as feeling like being stuck in the back with a spear, an almost identical analogy to being pierced by an arrowhead.
A skeptic might argue that these symptoms could apply to someone other than Alexander the Great. Iron and bronze connect this passage to Nebuchadnezzar’s vision of the statue in Daniel 2. Bronze refers to Alexander’s own empire. This suggests treachery: the king of the bronze empire laid low by bronze. Iron represents the next empire: Rome. The kingdoms that sprang from his empire, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, would eventually be conquered by Rome, the iron weapon from which his successors could not flee.

#### Verses 27-28. “**The heavens will expose his guilt; 
##### the earth will rise up against him. 
#### A flood will carry off his house, 
##### rushing waters on the day of God’s wrath.**” 
The flood could be a poetic description of the ailing man’s diarrhea, but there is no mistaking the wrath of both heaven and earth. Both God and Satan had their hand in Alexander’s destruction, including his house: the murder of his wife and children.

*Job 23, 1 BC-120 AD, A time to weep: Jesus endures the Cross*

#### “Today also my complaint is bitter;
##### my hand is heavy on account of my **groaning.** (23:2)
#### Behold, I go forward, but **he is not there**, 
##### and backward, but I do not perceive him;
#### on the left hand when he is working, 
##### I do not behold him; 
#### he turns to the right hand, 
##### but **I do not see him**. (23:8-9)
#### God has made my **heart faint**; 
##### the Almighty has **terrified** me;
#### yet I am **not silenced** because of the **darkness,**
##### nor because thick darkness covers my face. (23:16-17)
Compare the words of Job to what Jesus said in John’s gospel:

#### A little while, and you will see me no longer; 
##### and again a little while, and you will see me.” 
###### - John 16:16, ESV

*Job 26, 360-480 AD, A time to dance*

By the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 AD, Rome became a Christian empire and all Roman persecution of Christians ceased.
Rome was one of Satan’s beasts, now pierced and controlled by Christ’s kingdom. 
Rome in this passage is symbolized by two sea serpents, Rahab and Leviathan, the Western and Eastern Roman empires, respectively:

#### By his power he stilled the sea;
##### by his understanding he **shattered Rahab**.
#### By his wind the heavens were made fair;
##### his hand **pierced the fleeing serpent**. (26:12-13)

*Job 34, 1328-1447 AD (by a different clock), or 1320-1440 AD, A time to cast away.*

The Black Plague and sieges against Constantinople are prophesied in Job 34. 

  - The "incurable wound" is both the effects of the plague and a series of devastating sieges by the Ottoman’s from which Byzantium would never recover. 
  - The reference to water is the terrible thirst suffered by plague victims.
  - Those who are “shaken” have fever and chills.
  - When it says “they die in an instant”, people who often seemed well when they went to bed died during the night. 
  
#### Although I am right, I am considered a liar; 
##### although I am guiltless, his **arrow** inflicts an **incurable wound**.’ (34:6)
#### Is there anyone like Job, who drinks scorn like **water?** (34:7, NIV)
#### They die in an instant, **in the middle of the night**; 
##### the people are **shaken** and they pass away; 
###### the mighty are removed without human hand. (34:20-21, NIV)
#### Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and 
##### sets up others in their place. 
#### Because he takes note of their deeds, 
##### he **overthrows them in the night** and they are crushed. (34:24-25, NIV)

*Job 35, 1440-1560 AD, a time to tear.*

This is the time when greater wisdom began to arrive, the Childbearing, when a woman cries out in the night as she delivers her child.

#### Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out;
#### they call for help because of the arm of the mighty.
#### But none says, 
##### ‘Where is God my Maker,
###### who gives **songs in the night**,
##### **who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth**
###### and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?’ (Job 35:9-11, ESV)
This points us to the heavens, when Copernicus wrote *De Revolutionibus orbium coelestium* and began the Copernican revolution in astronomy.

#### Look up at the heavens and see;
##### gaze at the clouds so high above you. (35:5, NIV)

*Job 36, 1560-1680 AD, A time to mend*

The new Protestant churches believed that all people must be taught to read, so that they may read the Bible for themselves:

#### “God is exalted in his power. 
##### **Who is a teacher like him?** (36:22, NIV)
Lawrence Stone, in “The Educational Revolution in England 1500-1640”, revealed something remarkable. Between the Reformation and the mid-seventeenth century, England built schools. Lots of schools! In fact, the number of schools increased more than tenfold. Puritans especially were keen to teach everyone how to read so that they could read the Bible. England devoted one quarter of all charitable funds to the construction of schools and their endowment, so that the poor could be educated. By the end of this period, over half of all people in England could read and 2.5% of men had a college degree.

Job 36 even prophesies the first Thanksgiving of the Pilgrims in America:

#### “He is wooing you from the jaws of distress
##### to **a spacious place free from restriction**,
#### to the comfort of your **table laden with choice food**. (Job 36:16)

It also predicts the explosion in the writing of Christian hymns during that era:
#### **Remember to extol his work, 
##### which people have praised in song.** (36:24, NIV)

*Job 37: 1680-1800 AD, a time to be silent.*

God’s determination to silence people is given here:

#### He seals up the hand of every man,
##### that all men whom he made may know it.
#### Then the beasts go into their lairs,
##### and remain in their dens. (Job 37:7-8, ESV)

How do you compel people to cease from work and spend time listening to God? First, you shout:

#### Keep **listening** to the **thunder** of **his voice**
##### and the **rumbling** that comes from **his mouth**.
#### Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
##### and his **lightning** to the corners of the earth.
#### After it his **voice roars;**
##### he **thunders** with his majestic **voice,**
###### and he does not restrain the lightnings when **his voice** is heard.
#### God **thunders** wondrously with **his voice**;
##### he does great things that we cannot comprehend. (37:2-5)

From the language, we know that God’s voice is the theme of this chapter:

  - Thunder (3)
  - Lightning(s) (4) plus golden splendor
  - Rumbling + Roars
  - His Voice (4) + his majestic voice
  
Historically, this was the time of the Enlightenment & Scientific Revolution.
Climatologically, this was the Little Ice Age.

#### From its chamber comes the whirlwind,
##### and cold from the scattering winds.
#### By the breath of God ice is given,
##### and **the broad waters are frozen fast**. 
###### - Job 37:9-10, ESV

During this period fell the year 1709, a particularly deadly time amidst the continuing Little Ice Age. 
“Winter Is Coming: Europe’s Deep Freeze of 1709” by Juan José Sánchez Arreseigor provides the chilling details. 
In England, William Derham wrote: “I believe the Frost was greater ... than any other within the Memory of Man.” 
Scientists reckon it the coldest winter in five hundred years. 
The Baltic Sea froze over for four months, permitting people to walk from Denmark to Sweden.
Venetians forsook their gondolas to skate along their canals while the “broad waters” of the Rhône River in France could support the weight of a cart. 
That year, the harsh winter and subsequent flooding and poor harvest killed 600,000 in France alone. 
This deadly year fell near the end of the Maunder Minimum, a period from 1645-1715 when the sun seldom sported any sunspots, suggesting the light of the sun was diminished.

Not only new ideas and weather got people to stop working. So did war:

#### Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
##### and his lightning to the corners of the earth. 
###### - Job 37:3, ESV

This period saw more wars and more deaths due to warfare than any preceding epoch in history, surpassed only by the 20th century. 
By historians it is called the General Crisis of the seventeenth century.
The prophecy is no hyperbole: it struck the whole “civilized” world, excepting those parts of Africa lacking large kingdoms, 
Australia and many island peoples. Combining the lightning imagery of both chapters 36 and 37, you get an extended period of unrest, 
climate disruption, war, and famine. No other period in history saw so many wars flare up across so great an area until we reach the 
Twentieth Century with its two World Wars and communist revolutions. Here is a summary of the strife:

  - **India.** The Mughal-Maratha wars lasted half a century and left five million dead, adding to the earlier misery of the Deccan famine which killed seven million more. China. The Ming-Qing dynasty transition killed 25 million.
  - **Japan.** The Sengoku period of constant civil war lasted 150 years.
  - **Germany.** The Thirty Years War killed up to 12 million. England. The Wars of the Three Kingdoms killed almost a million.
  - **Spain.** The War of the Spanish Succession claimed over a million lives.
  - **Other European nations**. The French, Dutch, Swedes, Russians, Ottomans and others became embroiled in deadly wars of their own. Poland collapsed completely. 
  - **Burma.** Invaded by China.
  - **Southeast Asia**. Ports and islands were captured by the Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, British and French, including the Philippines.
  - **The Americas**. All indigenous empires had already been overthrown by Spain, Portugal and other European colonial empires. Now disease, climate change and war killed a majority of the survivors. **Africa.** The largest Central African empires either fractured or were absorbed into the Muslim world. Many of their subjects wound up in Muslim slave markets or New World plantations.
  - **England, France & Allies**. The Seven Years War was the final blow to exhaust the European powers. Snuffing out over a million lives in Europe, Africa, North and South America, India and the Philippines, it was a precursor of the world wars.

Yes, God’s lightning struck the whole world. Why? Verses 7 and 8 give us a clue. 

#### “The animals take cover, 
##### they remain in their dens.” 

What are those animals? Kingdoms and empires. Why are they stopped from continuing their labor? 
So that they may watch God do “great things beyond our understanding” as it says in verse 5.
What great thing did God do? He arranged for the founding of the United States of America.

*Job 38: 1800-1920 AD, a time to speak.*

In this era, God changed the whole world:

#### The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
##### its features stand out like those of a garment. (Job 38:14, NIV)

How did God mold the world into new image?

  - Slavery forcefully outlawed in most of the world Serfs freed in Russia
  - Dalits (untouchables) & other low caste peoples in British India enjoyed modest improvements in status and rights
  - Women gained the right to vote and hold office in dozens of nations
  - Democratic institutions matured
  - Prisons reformed
  - Public education expanded, 
  - literacy increased 
  - Mentally ill treated more humanely
  - Old age pensions instituted
  - Science, Medicine & public health advanced 
  - Agriculture, industry & transportation revolutionized 
  - Christianity spread by missionaries worldwide

How did people rise to meet God’s challenges? By our science we began to find answers to the questions that God put to Job:

#### Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,
##### or have you seen the storehouses of the hail,
#### which I have reserved for the time of trouble,
##### for the day of battle and war? (Job 38:22-23, ESV)

Roald Amundsen in 1911 reached the South Pole, the heart of earth’s greatest “storehouse of snow”.
Those storehouses proved decisive against Napoleon in 1812. First, the Russian Winter, worsened by the continuing Little Ice Age, 
killed, crippled or captured hundreds of thousands of Napoleon’s soldiers, humbling the largest army ever assembled in Europe up to that time.

How did God speak to the world in a new way?

#### Do you know the laws of the heavens?
##### Can you set up God’s dominion over the earth?
#### **Do you send the lightning bolts on their way?** 
##### **Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?**
###### - Job 38:33,35, NIV

Christian missions were amplified by new technologies, all dependent upon mankind being able to “send the lightning bolts on their way” 
through power lines and report “Here we are!” by sending human voices over the wires. All these marvels were invented in this era:

  - telegraph
  - telephone
  - radio
  
On top of this, an early prototype of the television was demonstrated in 1911 by Boris Lvovich Rosing of Russia, though television would
not have an impact on the world until the next era.
    
The first telegraph message sent by Samuel Morse was, “What hath God wrought?”

What God wrought was a new world. From the Protestant Reformation to the Scientific Revolution to the Industrial Revolution, 
the world was upended. It was a true "Childbearing". The remnants of the ancient world gave birth to the modern world.
And it happened exactly when the Bible predicted it would.

### Matthew 21

While Job defines a model for ordination, applies it to women, and by connection to Ecclesiastes tells us when it would happen,
the Gospel of Matthew has important contributions to offer. According to the calendar given to us by Solomon,
Matthew 21 matches the twenty-first time, "a time to tear", the Protestant Reformation, which accelerated the liberation of women.
The story of Palm Sunday, when Jesus entered Jerusalem, includes these words:

#### “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately 
#### you will find **a donkey tied, and a colt with her.** 
#### Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, 
#### you shall say, 
##### ‘The Lord needs them,’ 
#### and he will send them at once.” 
#### This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying,
##### “Say to the **daughter** of Zion,
###### ‘Behold, your king is coming to you,
##### humble, and mounted on a donkey,
###### on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’” 
###### Matthew 21:2-5, ESV

Job 39, which matches "a time for love", has a parallel passage. Right after describing the mountain goats giving birth
and the calving of the does, God talks about the greater liberty that is to follow the Childbearing:

#### “Who has let the wild donkey go free?
##### Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,
#### to whom I have given the arid plain for his home
##### and the salt land for his dwelling place?
#### He scorns the tumult of the city;
##### he hears not the shouts of the driver.
#### He ranges the mountains as his pasture,
##### and he searches after every green thing.
###### - Job 39:5-8

In Job, God takes credit for setting the donkey free. The donkey is a beast of burden, 
symbolizing all who work as slaves or menial servants. Since Job 39 has been talking about 
female creatures giving birth, it is logical to conclude that this passage speaks of the freeing of women from servitude.

Then in Matthew, the picture is clearer.:

  - The female donkey represents the women who lived before the Protestant Reformation, before the Childbearing, who had known hard service.
  - The colt represents the women who live after the Childbearing for they are the children. They are loosed before ever having to endure servitude, freed as children.
  
The donkey and colt are being set free to serve Jesus.
The colt symbolizes a new world, a new civilization, the daughter of Zion.

Later in Matthew 21 we find another passage with feminine analogies:

#### But when the chief priests and the scribes 
#### saw the wonderful things that he did, 
#### and the children crying out in the temple, 
##### “Hosanna to the Son of David!” 
#### they were indignant, and they said to him, 
##### “Do you hear what these are saying?” 
#### And Jesus said to them, 
##### “Yes; have you never read,
##### ‘Out of the mouth of **infants and nursing babies**
##### you have prepared praise’?” 
###### - Matthew 21:15-16, ESV

  - The infants and nursing babies are the children of the Reformation.
  - The priests and scribes are indignant because these children are 
filling the temple with praise in a way that broke their ancient rules.
  - These children are emphatically NOT quiet.

### Psalm 22 

Psalm 22 matches the twenty-second time, a time to mend. It too has feminine analogies that
tie it to the matter at hand:

#### Yet you are he who took me from the womb;
##### you made me trust you **at my mother's breasts**.
#### On you was I cast **from my birth**,
##### and **from my mother's womb** you have been my God. 
###### - Psalm 22:9-10, ESV

#### Posterity shall serve him;
##### it shall be told of the Lord 
###### to **the coming generation**;
#### they shall come and proclaim his righteousness 
##### **to a people yet unborn**,
###### that he has done it. 
###### - Psalm 22:30-31, ESV

In a broad sense, the coming generation, those "people yet unborn", is every future generation of
Christians who benefited from the Lord's sacrifice. But by the focusing effect of the timetable of Ecclesiastes,
the more direct fulfillment of these words is the creation of a free people who burst from the womb of the Reformation, 
accomplished by means that only Jesus could have employed. Psalm 22 is a celebrated Psalm
that Christ quoted while on the cross. It speaks about his suffering, but also the miracles
that his suffering would accomplish. I believe that by quoting this Psalm, which maps to the time
of mending immediately following the Reformation, Jesus is promising from the cross to set women free.
This was a shout-out to all Christian women down through the centuries that he would finish the task.

This concludes a brief defense of the proposition that Job and several other Bible books contain 
prophecies laid out so regularly that you can set your watch by them. This regularity allows us
to connect key prophecies in Job to history and show when the sacrifice of women would be complete 
and their Ordination accomplished. That sacrifice was completed with the Childbearing, the Protestant Reformation.
After that, women needed to:

  -  heal in *a time to mend* (1560-1680 AD)
  -  be taught to read, to study the Bible, and to listen to God in prayer during *a time to be silent* (1680-1800 AD)
  -  be commissioned to preach and share the gospel, during *a time to speak* (1800-1920 AD)
  
With this result, we can tackle some thorny passages in the New Testament.

## Reconciliation: The Childbearing in 1 Timothy 2 and the Law in Ephesians 5

A major battleground in the debate over whether God permits women to serve as pastors and elders is 1 Timothy 2.
I will offer a prophetic interpretation of those verses that shows a redemptive trajectory from the restricted 
state of women in Paul's time to the less restricted state of today. It is a struggle to express these ideas clearly and
concisely. It occurred to me this month that God has given us two signs by which we can know the truth:

  - A spiritual sign, given earlier
  - A literal sign, given later

### Two Signs so the Church might see

God gave the spiritual sign to Christians who were more in tune with the Holy Spirit to begin the age of liberation. 
Those believers could hear what others could not and began to obey and change the world, despite opposition from 
outside AND INSIDE the church. The signs given to them were difficult to express by reference to Scripture, because
before the mind can see the truth in the Bible, hearts must be freed, ears unstopped, eyes opened and hands 
put to the plow. It is the faith that comes through obedience. Only the scholarship that proceeded from a community
steeped in this faith could unlock the mysteries in the Bible that prophesied this time.

God loves His daughters. Therefore he gave us a second sign, a concrete one. This sign is harder to ignore, 
but the hard of heart still do. This sign is the fruit of the transformation. This sign is the ministry of women
and the marvels that their service has performed. 

The two signs are two different meanings of the same passage, Paul's verse in 1 Timothy 2 about the Childbearing. 

  - The beginning of the era was the Reformation, a spiritual Childbearing that spawned a new civilization. 
  - The end of the era of liberation was marked by twin discoveries: safe blood transfusions (developed over the course of centuries) and the first antibiotic in 1928.
  
Summarizing what was said previously, the transition period for the liberation of women spanned five of Solomon's times:

  - **a time to tear** (1440-1560 AD). The Childbearing of the Reformation, where the baby is the Protestant Church.
  - **a time time mend** (1560-1680 AD). The Wars of religion, when the patient suffered hemorrhaging, until the beginnings of religious freedom stopped the bleed.
  - **a time to be silent** (1680-1800 AD). Women (and men) are **silent** and listen to God during the Pietism movement, Methodist Revival and Great Awakening.
  - **a time to speak** (1800-1920 AD). Women and men go forth as missionaries to **speak** the gospel to the whole world and the first women become ordained ministers in the US.
  - **a time to love** (1920-2040 AD). Begins with women getting the vote in 1920 and results in women gaining equal rights in most spheres of life.

The history of blood transfusions is important, as many women died following childbirth from blood loss. The following timeline is courtesy of the Red Cross. See [History of Blood Transfusion](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/what-happens-to-donated-blood/blood-transfusions/history-blood-transfusion.html) for more details.

  - 1628: British physician William Harvey discovers the circulation of blood. The first known blood transfusion is attempted soon afterward.
  - 1658: Microscopist Jan Swammerdam observes and describes red blood cells.
  - 1665: The first recorded successful blood transfusion occurs in England: Physician Richard Lower keeps dog alive by transfusing blood from other dogs.
  - 1667: Jean-Baptiste Denis in France and Richard Lower and Edmund King in England separately report successful transfusions from sheep to humans.
  - 1818: British obstetrician James Blundell performs the first successful transfusion of human blood to a patient for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.
  - 1884: Saline infusion replaces milk as a “blood substitute” due to the increased frequency of adverse reactions to milk.
  - 1901: Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian physician, discovers the first three human blood groups.
  - 1907: Ludvig Hektoen suggests that the safety of transfusion might be improved by cross-matching blood between donors and patients to exclude incompatible mixtures.
  - 1907: Reuben Ottenberg performs the first blood transfusion using blood typing and cross-matching.
  - 1914: Long-term anticoagulants, among them sodium citrate, are developed, allowing longer preservation of blood.
  - 1939-1940: The Rh blood group system is discovered by Karl Landsteiner, Alexander Wiener, Philip Levine and R.E. Stetson.
  - 1940: Lots happened:
    -  The U.S. government establishes a national blood collection program.
    -  Edwin Cohn develops cold ethanol fractionation, the process of breaking down plasma into components and products. Albumin, gamma globulin and fibrinogen are isolated and become available for clinical use.
    -  John Elliott develops the first blood container, a vacuum bottle extensively used by the Red Cross.
    -  Early blood processing program for relief of English war victims, called Plasma for Britain, begins under direction of Charles R. Drew, MD.

Why focus on the history of blood transfusions? It is because the suffering of women is a type of the suffering of Christ.

  - Christ offered us his body to eat so that we might have eternal life and Women's bodies, used to create life, often perish from the ordeal.
  - Christ offered us his blood to drink, and hundreds of millions of women throughout history have died from postpartum blood loss.

The development of antibiotics protected the **bodies** of women from infection.

The development of safe techniques for **blood** storage and transfusion saved women from death by postpartum hemorrhage. 
The process of discovery for this latter life saving miracle began in 1628 during "a time to mend". It took almost the whole of this transitional period 
for transfusions to reach a state of general safety. 

Over forty million people died during the General Crisis of the 17th century, many in the wars of religion fought between 
Catholics and Protestants. It was the bloodiest century in history before the twentieth. If any era in history is a fitting analogy 
to a woman's postpartum blood loss, it is this one.

Combined, these two medical miracles, transfusion and antibiotics, reduced mortality from childbirth by a factor of more than fifty!
When Paul prophesied that women would be saved through "the Childbearing", he meant it. Not only would the world be transformed spiritually, 
saving souls, but the material lives of hundreds of millions of women would be saved. The upshot is that Paul told us to expect a special time
when women would be elevated both spiritually and materially to reach a place equal with men. That time would be linked to 
the actual, material deliverance of women from death during childbirth.

Thus, for the spiritual, the good news arrived centuries ago, with revelation of the doctrine of the priesthood of ALL believers. 
For the less spiritual, the good news arrived later, with medical developments (and advances in education and other areas) 
that removed the disabilities suffered by women which disqualified them from service.

The ideas I share about prophetic clocks are complicated and connect passages from all over the Bible into patterns that 
you might not have the patience to digest. The medical miracles, however, are incontrovertible. They are not wrapped in parables, riddles 
or peculiar analogies. They literally accomplished what Paul promised: women saved from the perils of childbirth. 
They are a firm anchor in time announcing by a miracle of God that the time of women's equality had arrived. 

Before we get to 1 Timothy 2, two questions. 

  - Who conducts all those blood drives that save lives? The Red Cross. 
  - And who started the Red Cross? Clara Barton. A woman.

### 1 Timothy 2

## Impartation: The Unsealing of the Scroll of Wisdom

Why the long wait?
The revelation of this information had to wait until Jesus began to unseal the scroll of Revelation.
Four seals have already been removed. They sealed up a portion of the wisdom found in:
Psalms: The Lordship of Jesus, widespread publication of the Bible
Job: God’s sovereignty, suffering that produces wisdom, the priesthood of all believers
Proverbs: Economic freedom, capitalism, abolition of slavery
Song of Songs: Sexual and racial equality, revolution in social relationships
The fifth seal is about to be removed.
This unsealing will teach wisdom found in Ecclesiastes.
The focus of this new wisdom is time, the understanding of the rough outline of God’s plan for history and how to arrange the prophecies into an orderly, quantifiable structure.
