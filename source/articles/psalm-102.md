This article originally appeared as part of "Appendix D: To Number our Psalms" of 
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. It is part of my journey to understand the Psalms.
When I wrote it, I had already had success deciphering Psalm 119 and the Historical Psalms (78, 105, 106, 107, 114, 135, 136). As I was finishing up the book, I made further progress, tackling Psalms 31, 58, 91, 100, 110, 121 and 127. This study was a bridge to the major work of analyzing another seventy or so Psalms in 
*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*.

Psalm 102 was written by a man who thought he was about to die, but received a reprieve and 
length of days from the Lord. It is fitting that his words are a prophecy of the future of a nation
that felt the same way: Israel.
