title: The Fifth Seal
---
The bulk of this article first appeared as "Postscript: Because I promised" in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. 
It focuses on the plague of darkness, the ninth of the plagues against Egypt.
God has woven together many patterns in history. They all connect near the end of time.
Thus in God's larger application of the pattern of the plagues against all mankind, not just Egypt, we 
are about to face a worldwide plague of darkness. This plague is the flip side of the opening of the Fifth Seal of the scroll.

  - The Fifth Seal, when opened, triggers a great persecution.
  - The persecution separates Christians from non-Christians by forcing the Christians to flee or dissociate themselves from relationships with unbelievers.
  - Non-christians, now separated from the light of the church, are plunged into darkness.
  - The plague of darkness destroys all progress in science, separating the lost from the "god" that they once turned to to solve all their problems.

The irony is that even as the world is plunged into darkness, God will be opening the minds of the faithful to see 
marvelous truths hidden in the Bible. The Lord will open more of the scroll for our inspection, first the Book of Ecclesiastes, 
then when the sixth seal is opened, the Book of Matthew.

The Book of Ecclesiastes will be illuminated for us by the Spirit of Might.
God's Word shall be our strength.

## What is the modern plague of darkness?

The cover of this book implied a promise when it asked, “Which plague’s next?” Brief
summaries were given in “Epilogue: The Fifth Commandment” and “Exodus: Clocks of
Judgment for Israel and the Church”. This author is not a prophet. I feel comfortable
matching already fulfilled prophecies to past events. That is the work of a historian and
apologist. When I extrapolate the Bible’s clocks into the future, the most I can confidently
assert is that a given Bible passage holds a prophecy and that it will be fulfilled in the time
period that corresponds to its place in the clock’s structure. To say how the prophecy will
be fulfilled is speculation. Now I shall speculate, comparing trends I see in the world
around me to the images provided by these prophecies. Because it is speculation, I have
buried it after the end notes where I suspect few will read it, but at least I will have kept my
promise.

Four major prophetic themes shall all collide in the near future, disrupting this world:

  - Solomon’s “time to hate”
  - The opening of the fifth seal on Revelation’s scroll
  - The Exodus plague of darkness
  - The ninth commandment against lying
  - The tenth commandment against covetousness

The analysis of clocks in this book and in Peace gave the evidence and established the
time periods for all five as in our near future. Now to consider what that will mean for the
world.

## Relevant Scripture passages

Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. (Psalm 119:105)

We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can
work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
(John 9:4-5)

You are the light of the world.
A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. (Matthew 5:14)

Give attention to me, my people,
and give ear to me, my nation;
for a law will go out from me,
and I will set my justice for a light to the peoples.
(Isaiah 51:4)

[Pharaoh speaks to Moses during the Plague of Darkness] Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away
from me; take care never to see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.”
(Exodus 10:28)

When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the
word of God and for the witness they had borne. They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign
Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on
the earth?” Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the
number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they
themselves had been. (Revelation 6:9-11)

These passages disclose three sources of light. The first source is God’s Law, the Ten
Commandments, which promotes justice. The second light is Jesus Christ. The third light
is the church, whose witness spreads the light of Christ.

## A Fourth Light, Fading

There is a fourth light: human reason, as expressed in the scientific endeavor. God will
judge the world by removing the fourth light for its crime of attempting to extinguish the
other three. We can see this spiritually as well as materially. The symbolic representation of
the divine light is – well – light. The spiritual representation of divine light is a
commitment to the truth. God is executing this plague against mankind by taking action
against both symbol and spirit.

The passage from Exodus tells us what kind of man Pharaoh was. He craved power, not
truth. He refused to look any more upon the face of Moses, the face of divine light, and so
his kingdom was plunged into physical darkness. People today are much like pharaoh.
They believe that they can have mastery over nature, through science, but dispense with
the source of scientific truth, namely God and the accumulated wisdom of the church.

Pharaoh hated Moses. Hate leads to persecution and separation. As the world enters
Solomon’s time to hate, the modern pharaohs have already told the new Moses, Jesus, to
get lost. They do not want to see him anymore, and if he (or his representative, the church)
should approach, he promises he will kill them. Thus shall come the great persecution that
will attend the opening of the fifth seal. That persecution will be against Jews and
Christians. Many Jews will flee from America to Israel, at last completing the prophecy of
the ingathering. Christians will have nowhere to run.

Before we continue, a disclaimer. I work for an oil company and my parents worked for
General Electric, founded by Thomas Edison.

The first symbolic step toward darkness was the banning of Edison’s incandescent bulb,
the invention most associated with light. The second step is the relentless march to
“replace” the world energy system with one free of hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas). In
the last few centuries, humanity has moved to new sources of energy several times, but
each time the switch was first proven out with new inventions (like the steam engine or
internal combustion engine) and exploration for the necessary raw materials, like coal, oil
or gas. Not until the needs for energy could be fully and economically met by the new
source did we give any thought to displacing the old.

Not so the current panic surrounding climate change. Copper, lithium and rare earth
minerals are needed for the solar panels, batteries, turbines and other components of the
new energy system. Given proven deposits and current rates of mining, it would take a
thousand years or more to dig enough of these materials to satisfy the needs of the next
forty years of buildout. Only by immediately beginning strip mining all over the world on
a massive scale could we hope to achieve this. We would destroy the planet we are trying to
save.

(This claim is based on research by Simon Michaux, Associate Professor of
geometallurgy at the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) in KTR, the Circular Economy
Solutions Unit. His YouTube video is titled “The Quantity of Metals Required to
Manufacture Just One Generation of Renewable Technology to Phase Out Fossil Fuels.”)

Take copper as an example. The estimated need for new copper over the next thirty years
equals all copper ever mined by everyone throughout all of human history. Why is copper
a good example? Decades ago the world was running out of copper. It was needed for all
the world’s telephone cables. Things looked bleak. Then someone invented the fiber optic
cable. Those cables are made of glass. Glass is cheap and abundant. After the switchover to
fiber optic cabling, the supply of copper rebounded.

Such things are possible concerning our current situation, but you cannot legislate them!
Governments can fund research but they do not have godlike powers to change the laws of
physics or speed up time. Solutions that allow us to use cheap, abundant materials to build
out a new energy system that do not require massive ecological devastation may be
possible. How long will it take? Ten years? A hundred? If you force the world to build on
spec before those solutions have been proven in demonstration projects, you will get the
results that we are seeing in Germany and Australia. Brownouts. Shuttered factories.
Business leaving because the power is unreliable. The lights turned off.

The entire push to stop global warming is a parable in itself. Studies show that ten to
twenty times more people die from exposure to cold than from heat. For example,
consider a 2021 study published in The Lancet Planetary Health. According to the
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/hot-cold-extreme-temperature-deaths/):

<p><em>Published in Lancet Planetary Health, the second paper reported that between 2000 and 2019, annual
deaths from heat exposure increased. But deaths from cold exposure, which were far more common, fell by
an even larger amount.</em></p>

<p><em>All told, during those two decades the world warmed by about 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit, and some 650,000
fewer people died from temperature exposure.</em></p>

By opposing global warming, people are in effect saying that they want to reduce the
amount of light coming from the sun and shiver to death in the dark. Like Pharaoh, they
demand darkness, for in darkness no one can see the face of God.

In the spiritual realm, we are seeing a corruption of science itself. Surveys of several
branches of science show that half or more of all papers put forth results that cannot be
reproduced by other scientists. Some are fraudulent. Others were poorly conducted.

Fake peer review and citation rings have been detected, wherein a group of researchers
agree to back each other up, getting their papers approved even if they have errors, and
rejecting anyone outside their circle. One example of this kind of fraud was uncovered in
July 2014 by Sage Publications. They had to retract 60 papers from the Journal of
Vibration and Control. They discovered that researcher Peter Chen at the National
Pintung University of Education (NPUE), rigged the peer reviews of all 60 papers by
generating fake email accounts for real reviewers and impersonating them.

Scientists whose findings enrage special interests have their papers retracted because the
journals are hounded by bullies with political power. They are turned down for grants, fail
to make tenure, and are attacked in the press. One example of pressure being applied to
force the retraction of a paper for political reasons is the paper “A critical assessment of
extreme events trends in times of global warming” (by Gianluca Alimonti, Luigi Mariani,
Franco Prodi & Renato Angelo Ricci). It said in its abstract,

#### “In conclusion on the basis of observational data,
#### the climate crisis that, according to many sources, 
#### we are experiencing today, is not evident yet.”

Yes, using accepted sources, they showed that we have not yet seen any increases in the
frequency or intensity hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, drought or wildfires in the last few
decades, contradicting claims by politicians, the media and many scientists. If those
problems have not yet arisen, what is the urgency?

If saner heads do not prevail in this rush to dismantle our energy system, what will the
outcome be? Agricultural output will plummet, triggering famine. Skeptical? This already
happened in one country. The push to reduce use of petroleum derived fertilizer (which is
advocated by the misguided elites pushing the climate change narrative) devastated Sri
Lanka in under a year! Consider this quote from
[Foreign Policy in 2022](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farming-crisis/):

<p><em>Last April, Rajapaksa’s government made good on that promise, imposing a nationwide ban on the
importation and use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and ordering the country’s 2 million farmers to
go organic.</em></p>

<p><em>The result was brutal and swift. Against claims that organic methods can produce comparable yields to
conventional farming, domestic rice production fell 20 percent in just the first six months. Sri Lanka, long
self-sufficient in rice production, has been forced to import $450 million worth of rice even as domestic
prices for this staple of the national diet surged by around 50 percent. The ban also devastated the nation’s
tea crop, its primary export and source of foreign exchange.</em></p>

Other ill effects will include skyrocketing electricity rates, automobiles half the
population cannot afford, wars over resources like that in Ukraine, and more.

The US government has taken to censoring stories critical of its policies by colluding
with social media companies. This facilitated suppression of the theory (now considered
highly credible) that COVID-19 escaped from a Chinese lab. This was done to avoid
embarrassing the US health officials who approved and funded the gain of function
research done in China under unsafe conditions. Such research was forbidden by US law.
Their arrogant disregard for law and truth contributed to the deaths of millions.

The government also assured nursing mothers that the vaccine was safe because it
couldn’t get into breast milk, now also shown to be false, as reported in The Lancet in
[Biodistribution of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in human breast milk](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00366-3/fulltext).

Recent cases of fraud in all areas of science are many. Harvard Business School professor
Francesca Gino billed herself as an expert on honesty and deception. She was the deceiver,
her research fabricated. Florida State University criminology professor Eric Stewart made
up his data in studies cited by hundreds of other researchers. His studies found racism
where it didn’t exist, promoting racial hatred and contributing to the “time to hate”.

If fraud and political pressures to not tell the truth keep mounting, eventually scientific
progress will halt. That is darkness. The ruination of human intellect is God’s wrath
against all who violate His ninth commandment. Thou shalt not lie.

You may ask, since God has already judged nine civilizations (Babel through Islam), why
we are not instead seeing judgment against violating the tenth commandment? Recall that
there are two large cycles of judgment underway, against the church and against the beasts
of the earth: the empires of man. These cycles began millennia apart but run out at about
the same time. The cycle of judgment against the church is reaching the ninth
commandment and the plague of darkness. The cycle against Western Civilization is
reaching the tenth commandment and the plague against the firstborn.

The judgment against the church also effects our civilization. As segments of the church
continue to depart from the gospel, God’s response cuts both ways. The world perishes for
losing the church’s light and the church suffers at the hands of the people they could not
save with their corrupted gospel. That will bring us all, church and civilization, to the
tenth commandment and the plague on the firstborn. Faithless Christians will be turned
away by the “Firstborn over all creation” when Jesus separates the sheep from the goats. So
will all who rejected the light of the world.

Those are the plagues we are beginning to face.

Pray with me.
