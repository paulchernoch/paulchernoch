Six is trouble. 

Man was created on day six, and so were the beasts, some of which represent evil empires in prophecy. 

Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came upon the earth, according to Genesis 7:6.

The sixth commandment is against murder, the most violent and irreversible breach of God's law.

In Numbers 35, Moses established six cities of refuge. A person accused of murder could flee to one of these cities to escape until the intense wrath of the victim's family subsided. This would enable them to get a fair trial, not a revenge killing. 

The anti-Christâ€™s number is 666, a complete trinity of evil.

In Revelation, John is told that a series of seven great beasts would dominate the earth in succession, followed by a shorter lived eighth beast, Leviathan. The sixth beast in that sequence was Rome, the terrible beast, the beast of iron. No human empire has ever lasted longer than Rome nor risen to such prominence.
