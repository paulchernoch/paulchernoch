title: What are the Seven Pillars of Wisdom?
---
Proverbs uses an image that has spawned debate for millennia, a house with seven pillars.

#### Wisdom has built her house;
##### she has hewn her **seven pillars**.
#### She has **slaughtered her beasts**; she has **mixed her wine**;
##### she has also **set her table**.
#### She has sent out her young women to call
#### from the highest places in the town,
##### “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
#### To him who lacks sense she says,
##### “Come, eat of my bread
##### and drink of the wine I have mixed.
##### Leave your simple ways, and live,
##### and walk in the way of insight.”
###### - Proverbs 9:1-6

What are those seven pillars that hold up Lady Wisdom's house?

This website has many articles that build upon an answer to that question that I first proposed in
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. The best article on this website to read is 
[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom](./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html). It goes into many of the clues that
I found which either led me to my conclusion or supplied additional evidence after I found what the pillars are.

The simple answer is that the Seven Pillars are seven books of the Bible:

  - Psalms
  - Job
  - Proverbs
  - Song of Songs
  - Ecclesiastes
  - Matthew
  - Revelation

A deeper answer is that the pillars are seven spiritual principles, with each principle
forming the focus of one of the seven books. Those seven principles of wisdom are
not absent in the rest of the Bible. What distinguishes these seven books is that all of them
conform both to Jesus' [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html) and Solomon's [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.md),
which other Bible books do not. The first is a tactical pattern for progressing in your faith and finding victory 
in spiritual battle. The second is a strategic pattern to govern your life. They each define processes that lead to peace
and make you strong like a pillar, unshakeable. Together they frame God's framework for time and his plan for all of history.

The first to prophesy the existence of the seven pillars was Hannah, the mother of the Prophet Samuel, as explained
in [Hannah's Song](./hannah-s-song.html).

The real riddle is not naming a collection of books, it is absorbing the wisdom that is in them and putting it
into practice. 

**From Psalms**, you must learn to revere God as your Lord and come to love His law, as practiced by David in Psalm 119.
You must allow these hymns of faith to prepare you as you face each new change in your life.
Let them be the strength that flows from knowing you are secure in God, your rock and your salvation.

**From Job**, you must derive endurance during the painful days of plowing, when God speaks to you through your suffering.
You must open your heart to wisdom and close it off to bitterness. Let it teach you compassion for others
and compel you to rely on the God of all Comfort. Allow the master teacher to teach,
so that your mind and hand may be readied for an eventual harvest.

**From Proverbs**, you must cultivate a heart that craves wisdom. Receive the seeds that seem so simple but
will one day sprout into grain fields and fruit orchards and deeper understanding of God. Learn to cherish 
what is of ultimate value, worshiping God and not the money, fame and power that idolaters crave.

**From Song of Songs**, you must learn to wrestle with time. Your passions shout, "Now!" but must be
channeled into pursuing things during the proper time and season. Embrace the good and refrain from embracing
evil. Instead of relying solely on your own judgment, seek the help of wise counselors, whether in your family, 
your church or among your friends and colleagues.

**From Ecclesiastes**, you must turn away from vain pursuits. Allow God to shape and prune your habits
so that you are headed towards a harvest, not futility and despair. Practice generosity and hospitality
and weigh opportunities with an eye to glorifying God. Do not squander your strength on foolish activities.
Where once you wrestled against time, you now are its master, as you muster your might to accomplish the 
dreams God is giving you.

**From Matthew**, you must learn the ways of the harvest. You will require detailed knowledge from God
to accomplish this. You will also require a strong community of believers to help you.
Your life of solo activity must give way to a life lived together. Forgiving others and being quick to listen
and slow to speak must define your approach to communication and action.

**From Revelation**, you must be prepared to fight the good fight. Peace is not won by people who refuse
to engage in the struggle against evil. Your loyalties will be tested. If they prove true, you will
win your reward. If you fear God, man cannot destroy you.

From all these books you must learn that life is not the aimless pursuit of pleasure. 
It has a direction and a goal. As a series of harvests, you prepare your tools, plow your fields, plant your seed, water, 
pluck weeds and finally reap a blessing, ending in peace. As a whole life, you progress from infant to child to teen,
before marrying, striving at work, growing in stature in the community, and finally playing a part in how the world is run.
The answer to the riddle is that God not only structured human life in that way, he structured His Word
logically to directly address the flow of life in a sequential manner. For every vain and futile material
activity and goal He has created a meaningful spiritual analogy.

From these books you must also learn that God directs history according to the same principles
and he has planned it out every bit as much as he planned out our lives. With that understanding,
you can learn how to fit into God's plan for the era into which you were born.

The last thing is simple. Pillars point up, so look up.
