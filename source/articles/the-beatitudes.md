<h1>Synopsis</h1>

The Beatitudes are more than scattered promises of divine help for people with different needs and 
more than a summary of character qualities that are essential in a disciple of Christ. This article will
show that the Beatitudes:

 - Are the answer to King David's prayer for salvation in Psalm 19
 - Follow the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html), showing the path from unbelief to peace with God
 - Line up with the Ten Commandments, point for point, in order
 - Define the *Ordo Salutis* (Order of salvation), the nine steps from God's initial call to a saint's glorification
 - Reveal God's prophetic plan to unveil each doctrine in the *Ordo Salutis* with power, in Chronological order, thereby shaking the world and carrying the Church toward maturity

See [Celestial Clocks - The Order of Salvation Clock](./celestial-clocks.html#19) for a concise presentation 
of just the prophetic content of the Beatitudes.
