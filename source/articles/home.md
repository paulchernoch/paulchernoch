## Welcome to Lady Wisdom's House

#### She is more precious than jewels,
##### and nothing you desire can compare with her.
#### Long life is in her right hand;
##### in her left hand are riches and honor.
#### Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
##### and all her paths are peace.
##### - Proverbs 3:15-17

Who is "she"? She is Lady Wisdom. Her words are not dry, boring rules that are practical but lifeless. If you seek the joy of her company, you have come to the right place.

King Solomon tells us in Proverbs 9 that Lady Wisdom built a house. Is that just a memorable metaphor? Or does the Bible offer a blueprint for her house?

The articles on this website describe that house's architecture and show how it constitutes a blueprint for an abundant life. From them you will learn how the wisdom books in the Bible are more than haphazard collections of miscellanous aphorisms. An underlying unity of structure and purpose runs through them. Understand that structure and those books will yield to you treasures hidden for long ages.

## Focus

The primary focus of this website will be on seven Bible books, the core books that reveal God's wisdom:

  - Psalms
  - Job
  - Proverbs
  - Song of Songs
  - Ecclesiastes
  - Matthew
  - Revelation

Additional insights will come from:

  - Genesis
  - Exodus
  - Isaiah
  - Habakkuk
  - 1 & 2 Timothy
  - The Other Gospels

Your guide will be an author who has spent decades researching and writing on topics related to the Biblical wisdom literature. Much of the material is the fruit of original research; you will not find its key ideas presented anywhere else. The parables of Job, Solomon, David and Jesus range over many topics, but we shall focus on two:

 1. **God's near term plan** for how He helps individuals navigate the many times of life as they grow into wise and mature adults.
 2. **God's long term plan** for how He helps civilizations navigate the many times of history to grow into great and just societies.

Between these two we shall explore both practical counsel for progressing your spiritual life and prophetic counsel to strengthen you to face the future in a turbulent world. No one can thrive unless they understand and cooperate with God's design for the seasons of life. Solomon not only listed them, he ordered them both logically and chronologically. 

## Three Interlocking Patterns for Living

The key insights are captured by three interlocking patterns:

1. A **Growth pattern**, defined by Solomon in Ecclesiastes. The wise king described the path from birth to maturity in the things of this world, our life *under the sun*. 
2. A **Harvest pattern**, defined by Jesus in Matthew. The *Lord of the Harvest* explained how to reap a spiritual harvest to help us attain spiritual maturity and overcome challenges like depression, anxiety, the fear of death and a life without purpose. 
3. A **Law pattern**, defined by Moses in Exodus. The Lawgiver supplies the matrix into which the Growth and Harvest patterns fit. God's Law supplies transcendent purpose and direction to humanity, a truth that for many years was NOT obvious to this author.

The unique contribution of this author is that all seven wisdom books (Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation) conform to both the Growth and Harvest Patterns. Once you see and comprehend this surprising structural connection you will be able to draw out many wonderful insights.

## Seeing the End from the Beginning

The logic and sequence of these Bible patterns do more than merely give form and direction to our individual human lives. They also govern the Bible's many prophecies. God has a plan for history. Stick around and you will learn what it is. Knowing that, you will see the contours of the seismic change beginning to convulse our world. While others stumble in darkness, you can walk in the light.

The Bible shines light on the future by laying the foundation for Eschatology, the study of the last things. Many contradictory theories exist concerning the unfolding of God's final judgments. They all lack a crucial discovery: the mainspring of God's prophetic clock. That mainspring is found in Ecclesiastes. Once properly applied to the Bible's many prophecies, you can discover with greater precision when most of them already have or will be fulfilled - excepting the singular mystery of when Christ shall return. 

In summary, this website will share glimpses into an original system of eschatology, **Fractal Historicism**. The theory is painstakingly developed in the author's recent books. The articles on this site should give an idea of the system's structure and implications; for the detailed scholarship and line by line analysis of Scripture that labors to prove its accuracy, consult those books.
