## Welcome to Lady Wisdom's House

#### She is more precious than jewels,
##### and nothing you desire can compare with her.
#### Long life is in her right hand;
##### in her left hand are riches and honor.
#### Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
##### and all her paths are peace.
##### - Proverbs 3:15-17

Who is "she"? She is Lady Wisdom. Her words are not dry, boring rules that are practical but lifeless. If you seek her company, you have come to the right place.

King Solomon tells us in Proverbs 9 that Lady Wisdom built a house. Is that just a memorable metaphor? Or does the Bible offer a blueprint for her house?

The articles on this website describe that house's architecture and show how it constitutes a blueprint for an abundant life. From them you will learn how the wisdom books in the Bible are more than haphazard collections of miscellanous aphorisms. An underlying unity of structure and purpose runs through them. Understand that structure and those books will yield to you treasures hidden for long ages.

The Bible books that this site will focus on are:

  - Psalms
  - Job
  - Proverbs
  - Song of Songs
  - Ecclesiastes
  - Matthew
  - Revelation

Your guide will be an author who has spent over a decade writing on topics related to the Biblical wisdom literature. Much of the material is the fruit of original research; you will not find its key ideas presented anywhere else. The parables of Solomon, David and Jesus range over many topics, but we shall focus on two:

 1. **God's near term plan** for how He helps individuals navigate the many times of life as they grow into wise and mature adults.
 2. **God's long term plan** for how He helps civilizations navigate the many times of history to grow into great and just societies.

Between these two we shall explore both practical counsel for progressing your spiritual life and prophetic counsel to strengthen you to face the future in a turbulent world.
