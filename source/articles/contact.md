This is your author speaking. My name is Paul Chernoch. 

To contact me, send an email to this address (inserting the parts of my name where appropriate):

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>first . last @yahoo.com</p>
</div>

Please begin the email subject heading with "Wisdom:". The colon is important. Omit the double quotes.
If the subject does not start like that, your email will be swallowed up in the bottomless pit
of spam in my inbox. I get hundreds of junk messages every day. My inbox is a mess.
If I missed your note, it would make me cry. God keeps all our tears in cloud storage, 
but I am nearing my storage limit. Don't make me sign up for a larger plan!
