## <a id="Preface">Preface</a>

Do you lack power and purpose? Do you still need
to be persuaded that God’s Word is both divine
and holds the answers you need? Have you strayed
from the path to peace? This book presents a simple
progression to get you on track:

Pillars. Patterns. Prophecies. Peace.

**Pillars**. Proverbs 9 says that wisdom has built her house,
she has hewn its seven pillars. Pillars supply the power to
hold up a house. The Bible has seven pillars and by
meditating on them, those pillars will be replicated within
you, making your life strong. Those seven pillars are
Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Matthew
and Revelation. This book tackles all seven and shows how
they share a unified structure: all seven conform to two
special patterns.

**Patterns**. Like a garden, a peaceful life must be sown
with good seed and cultivated diligently if a plentiful
harvest is to be reaped. This book explores *tactics* and
*strategies* God revealed to us to accomplish such a feat.
They are drawn from the Book of Ecclesiastes, the parables
of Jesus and elsewhere in Bible. The *tactics* revolve around
a [harvest pattern](./harvest-pattern.html) of seven steps which can be applied to
individual challenges throughout life. The *strategy* is built
upon the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3 which form a
[growth pattern](./growth-pattern.html). Grouped by fours into “seven pieces of
peace”, these times plot an orderly course through life’s
different seasons from birth to maturity, from “a time to be
born” to “a time for peace”. By these patterns you can
discover God’s changing purposes for you in every season
of life. You can also see God’s sovereign plan for all of
history.

**Prophecies**. Do these ancient principles and practices
still work? That is where Solomon’s wisdom shines. God
has shaped all of human history to conform to these same
patterns. When you see hundreds of prophecies unfolding
in the pages of history you can be certain that God’s plans
for an eternal harvest have not been derailed. You will be
persuaded that God’s Word is true, miraculous, and
expertly crafted to guide you onto the path to…

**Peace**. If the Lord can keep an uncooperative world on
track, He can establish you and guide you to your own time
for peace, with Lady Wisdom as your guide.

#### Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
##### and all her paths are peace.
###### - Proverbs 3:17, ESV
