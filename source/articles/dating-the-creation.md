## Chronological Guardrails

The Lord was clever when he designed the Bible. It was written so that it is possible with ease to estimate when events
occurred, but difficult to be precise. Part of this design includes a few special statements that summarize long stretches of history. This allows one to be confused about details like the lives of the Patriarchs or the time of the Judges, where 
many conundrums exist, while at the same time being able to skip over them and get to events like the Flood and Creation.
The effects of our confusion are thus localized; one or two errors need not wreck the whole timetable.

Why would God want people to have an imprecise understanding of the Biblical timeline? It is because of this imprecision
that people must search with care to find their answers. Only a person with faith will exhaust themselves performing
such calculations. God reserves knowledge for the diligent.

So what are these special chronological guardrails?

**First**, we have the length of the Egyptian Captivity:

#### Then the Lord said to Abram, 
##### “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners 
##### in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, 
##### and they will be afflicted for **four hundred years**.
##### - Genesis 15:13

#### And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would 
#### be sojourners in a land belonging to others, 
#### who would enslave them and afflict them **four hundred years**.
###### - Acts 7:6

**Second**, we have the length of time that the people lived in Egypt.
This seems to contradict the previous statement, but they measure different 
things. The conclusion is that the people lived in Egypt for thirty years without 
being mistreated, then the rest of the period as slaves.

#### The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. 
#### At the end of 430 years, on that very day, 
#### all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.
###### - Exodus 12:40-41

**Third**, we have the time from the entrance into the land until the time of Jephthah the judge:

#### While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, 
#### and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities 
#### that are on the banks of the Arnon, **300 years**, 
#### why did you not deliver them within that time?
###### - Judges 11:26

**Fourth**, we have the time from the Exodus until Solomon began to build the temple:

#### In the four **hundred and eightieth year** after 
#### the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, 
#### in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, 
#### in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, 
#### he began to build the house of the Lord.
###### - 1 Kings 6:1

These are but a few of the mathematical constraints included in the Bible that allow us to 
spot inconsistencies in our assumptions and calculations or rule between alternate solutions and decide
which seems most sensible. In what follows, places where the plainest reading of the Bible
produces answers that are inconsistent will be highlighted. The verses that provide a correction that leads to
a mathematically sound chronology will then be noted and explained. These verses are often nowhere near the 
genealogy or other statements that they correct. That is why some of these problems endured for so long 
before they were solved.

The table that builds up the case for how many years elapsed between the Creation and the building of Solomon's Temple
has a column for corrections. Most corrections will be explained. For the first twenty generations of history, though,
there are frequent one year corrections. These correct the assumed cumulative rounding error in the Bible's 
genealogies. This rounding error is described in the section's main article, [Chronoligy](./chronology.html).
It is not an error in the Bible's genealogies, but rather in how we attempt to use those counts of years
to create an unbroken timeline. The ages were rounded down to a whole number of years. We must restore the months
that were lost between each successive pair of generations.
