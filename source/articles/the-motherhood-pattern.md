In college, I drew a picture for an art class assignment. I had hidden in the picture imagery from a novel about a murder,
*The Onion Field*, where the furrows in my field were shaped like onions, hid the outline of a buried corpse, 
and a cloud was shaped like smoke blowing from a gun.
To me it was obvious, but the professor didn't "see" it, so I got poor marks.

Most of us are like my art professor. We give God poor marks because when we read His masterpiece, the Bible, 
we don't see it. We don't see the subtlety, the power, and the glory concealed in its pages.
How do we find that glory? What can make blind eyes see and deaf ears hear?

You can't find it by reading theology books, though you may need those books on your search.

You can't find it by asking clever questions and embarking on a systematic exploration of logic, philosophy, and history,
though you will surely need those things, too.

You can't find it by asking the smartest and holiest people in the world to explain it all, even though almost none
of us can do without their guidance.

Job told us in chapter 28 of his book that no mortal can find the path to wisdom. Only if wisdom comes to visit you
will you make any headway. You must become the kind of person that Lady Wisdom wants to visit and who won't miss her
knock on the door if she calls. You must possess a searching heart that is passionate about finding her treasures.

Why did I discover the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html)? At risk of being expelled from college, 
I meditated daily on Habakkuk for eighteen months. The prophet lamented a ruined life and nation without a harvest 
but praised God nonetheless. I never once spoke or even thought the explicit words, "How do I bring in a good harvest?" 
I just felt it. I craved it. When over the course of decades after college I lost job after job, did I ever wonder, 
"What does the Bible say about how to live a productive life? What are the steps involved?" I should have, but 
it wasn't something that ever made it to the surface of my conscious mind. What did happen was that day by day, 
year by year, job failure by job failure, the urgency of finding an answer was hammered into my soul.
Like Solomon said,

#### The words of the wise are like goads, and 
#### like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings; 
#### they are given by one Shepherd.
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:11

That urgent, passionate, desperate need primed my heart to be on the lookout for clues. Eventually it made its
way to the surface after the pieces were gathered but not assembled. Only at the end was I able to put it all together.
The same goes for the [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.html). I had no clue how to plan my life. As one born with
Asperger's, my deficiency in that area was crippling. Where others could lean on natural ability or good parenting
or training, I threw myself upon the grace of God. I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my forties. I didn't know
what my problem was or why. I just stumbled though life, but I stumbled with a longing to know what it was that
could turn the disorder of my life into a good and achievable plan.

Deep need, frequent prayer and faith in God kept me moving forward. Since God delights to answer such prayers,
I found first the perseverance to press on, then the right questions to ask, and finally their answers.

None of that explains how I discovered the Motherhood Pattern. Those other questions were about things 
that mattered to me. I needed the answers so I could better understand myself, get help and grow as a person.
I only discovered the Motherhood Pattern when I paused from my study, looked up from the book I was writing and 
realized that I was blind and selfish. I had found parts of God's plan for history, such as when He would liberate slaves 
and address colonialism, racism, and other evils. It was in looking for what I had missed that my error became
clear. In all that I had discovered, there was nothing about God's plan for women.

I was cut to the heart. I immediately prayed, "God, what is your plan for the liberation of women from oppression?"
Over the course of the next week, He answered. That was December, 2020. In the years since then, I have found more.
This article extends ideas expressed in my books. I do not deserve the grace extended to me. I have no business
unraveling mysteries that my heart had not pursued. God gave me more that I could ask for or imagine.:

#### Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more 
#### than all we ask or imagine, according to his power
#### that is at work within us, to him be glory in the
#### church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations,
#### for ever and ever! Amen.
###### - Ephesians 3:20-21, NIV

## The Mother of all Patterns

The Motherhood Pattern is a feminine variation on the masculine Growth Pattern.
It is also a feminine specialization of the Harvest Pattern and the Journey Pattern.
It is anchored to the Law Pattern, whose command to Honor Fathers AND Mothers is foundational.
In addition, the lives of many of the Bible's noblest women can be used to illustrate the 
progressive infusion of the Seven Spirits of God into the hearts of the faithful.

The upshot is that only after I had discovered all those other patterns would it even be possible
to discover this one. It is the Mother of all patterns. If you take this pattern alongside
the Growth Pattern, the gross features of history make sense, not just qualitatively, but
quantitatively as well. The grand proportions of history are precise in measure and 
and in meaning they silence Solomon's ironic protests of vain futility.

The pattern is a parable. It sets forth the stages of development of an individual woman from birth
to full maturity, accounting for the trials of marriage and childbearing. Then it zooms out
and applies that pattern to the history of whole civilizations at different scales.
When one civilization begets another, the pattern begins again at a different scale.
At the largest scale, the pattern applies to all of human history, at smaller scales to the combination 
of Israel and the Church, to the birth of Rome, the genesis of the Reformation Church and the coincident
birth of modern Western Civilization. Most recently, it includes the birth of the new nation of Israel.
This article will map events such as birth, puberty, marriage, conception and childbirth to
their metaphorical counterparts in the history of each civilization.

The Motherhood Pattern does more than explain history. It explains God's purpose in requiring
Christian women to suffer so long under conditions of inequality. It offers a new model for 
ordination to service long overlooked by the Church. This last is critical.

In the Church, some stake out the traditional position that women must not serve as pastors and elders.
Others insist that in Christ, there is neither male nor female, so women should be permitted to be
ordained and serve in those roles.

Both positions are wrong! For a detailed look at this particular issue, read 
[Against Complementarianism](./against-complementarianism.html). Here is a summary of the 
main points:

  1. All priestly orders have been and must be authorized by God via an explicit divine revelation. *"And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was."* (Hebrews 5:4)
  2. The start date after which candidates for ordination may be presented is given by God as well.
  3. The qualifying characteristics of the priests or elders are given, such as personal character, sex or tribe.
  4. The nature of the authority and religious practices of each such office are spelled out by God.
  5. For a person to be ordained, they must offer a sacrifice of ordination.
  6. What is acceptable as a sacrifice of ordination is also regulated by God.
  7. That sacrifice must occur literally at some point in history.
  8. The canon of Scripture is closed.
  9. If women are permitted by God to serve authoritative roles in the church, such instructions must already be in the Bible.
  10. No unambiguous extension of the requirements for ordination to the existing offices to include women may be found in the Bible.
  11. If women are to be permitted to serve as pastor or elder, a new model of ordination must be found.
  12. That model for ordination must have been instituted by a sacrifice that has already occurred in history and identified in prophecy.

Until recently, I would not have been able to find a Biblically supportable defense of women serving as pastors 
or elders that satisfied all of those criteria. My choices would then be three:

  1. Deny that women have been so called by God on solid Biblical grounds.
  2. Affirm that women have been so called by God but admit that I cannot fully defend this position.
  3. Affirm that women have been so called by God on specious grounds using fallible human arguments.

I spent over thirty years doing the first. Then I spent about three years doing the second. 
As hinted at above, in 2020 the Holy Spirit persuaded me that women are now permitted to be pastors and elders
but only revealed part of the Biblical justification for this. By faith, I openly professed my change of heart
and continued to study what the Bible had to say. Then near the start of this year (2024), I found the missing pieces.
I discovered the missing model for women's ordination, a prophetic clock that established the time frame for
its implementation, the nature of the sacrifice and the sign that it has already been offered and accepted by God.

I would never have found all these things if I had a laissez faire attitude towards Scripture. I accepted my ignorance
and the necessity of finding a complete answer. To my knowledge, no one else has discovered this solution to the 
problem. It is impossible unless you first reflect on the Motherhood Pattern. The heart of the pattern is found
in Job and so is the model for women's ordination. You see, Job is a parable for the suffering of women.
Because of this, since Job was ordained by God to a priestly ministry of forgiveness at the end of the book,
women are also ordained by the same ordination. Furthermore, the chapters of Job form a prophetic clock (as explained 
in [Generational Clocks](./generational-clocks.html)).
That means that the passages in Job that relate to the commencement of that ordination to service are prophetically
anchored in time. Job tells us when God gave women the green light to become pastors and elders.

The above claims are substantial. Hundreds of pages in my books or in articles elsewhere on this website 
are devoted to providing the evidence to back up these claims. The rest of this article will address some of
the issues and objections that can be raised. I will begin with the biggest. 

Q: Why would God make something so important as women's equality so murky? These ideas must be wrong.

A: Once I repented of my lack of interest in the plight of women, prayed to the Lord with humility, 
and asked a sincere question, the beginning of an answer came to me over the course of a week.
That gave me the tools and motivation to search for the rest of the answer.

The core of the answer is in Job, the first book of the Bible to be written. God caused the middle chapter 
of the Old Testament to be Job 29. And what is the middle verse of that chapter?

#### The one who was dying blessed me;
##### **I made the widow’s heart sing.**
###### - Job 29:13

That means that God's daughters are close to His heart. Widows were and are among the most vulnerable of people, 
without someone to protect them from harm. God sent his greatest prophets to help widows.

Important parts of the answer also appear at the proper place (according to the prophetic clocks in those books) 
in Proverbs, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Matthew, and Revelation. Once you see the evidence,
you will realize that it is only because of the hardness of our hearts that we have for so long been unable to grasp
the plain meaning of what is written.

I wrestled with what is the logical order to present the information to follow.
Then I decided that I am tired of logic. As I meditated on the subject before sitting down before my keyboard,
one of the ideas from my books multiplied like bunnies. (There is a bunny chewing on my lawn thirty feet from 
where I am sitting on my patio.) Before, I had found a single political entity whose progress through history
followed the Motherhood pattern: the Church. Now I know of at least six! Seeing something new is exciting, so I am
going with exciting instead of logical.

## World History as the Literal Birth of Empires

<img class="wide" src="images/six-motherhood-patterns.png" alt="Table of Six Civilizations"/>

Just as a woman gives birth to a child, so does one civilization give birth to another.
Before the last few years, that truism would have been as trite and meaningless to me as to most people.
It tells you nothing about how to live, to plan, or to understand this world. 
It tells you nothing but it could tell you everything *if you look close enough*.

When I wrote *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, I discovered things that turned my view of history upside down:

  1. The poem in Ecclesiastes 3 is a parable consisting of many metaphors that describe the course of a human life from birth to maturity in twenty-eight steps constituting seven phases, the [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.html).
  2. The last few chapters of Ecclesiastes continue the pattern on through middle age to the times of physical and mental decline and death.
  3. The poem is a parable for the development of spiritual Israel into the Church, then follows the church until it reaches full maturity in the faith.
  4. The church is eternal; it will not decline and die. Only the twenty-eight times ending in "a time for peace"  affect it.
  5. The world with its many cultures and other religions is not eternal; it will decline and die.
  6. Thus the world's twenty-eight times must be extended to include another fourteen times (of shorter duration)  to bring it through middle age to its inevitable fall.

Finding Solomon's Celestial Clock (for Israel and the Church) and the Grand Father Clock (for the whole world)
was exciting. They interpreted the times as they apply to men. Many of the times have an alternate meaning
when applied to women. For example, for men, "a time to tear" is a disagreement that must be resolved 
or even a civil war. For women, "a time to tear" is the day that she delivers her child.

When I later found the Motherhood pattern, I saw that it could also be applied to the Church.
When you do this, it shows that the Protestant Reformation was a time to tear, when the 
Roman Catholic Church gave birth to the Protestant Church. It also triggered a Civil war. 
Both the masculine and feminine meanings apply.

This past week, I discovered six examples of civilizations giving birth in this way.
That is not the surprising part. What shocked me was that even though each of these parent 
civilizations began at different times and lasted different numbers of years, the numerical 
ratios between each phase of growth and the whole remains constant. God has literally stretched out the
history of these empires or cultural entities from his template and cut them to size.
This perfection in proportion proves that there is a divine ordering to history.
Knowledge if this divine ordering may only be found in the Bible, in the pages of its wisest scholar and king,
Solomon.

The table heading this section maps the historical time periods to empires, to historical events,
to Solomon's times, and by the colors in the left column, to key phases in a woman's development.
These are the empires:

  - **The World**. This encompasses all of human history.
  - **Rome**. This follows Rome through its existence as kingdom, republic and empire.
  - **Europe**. From the ashes of the Western Roman Empire rose a combative confederacy of nations, Catholic Christendom. This was a marriage of Church and state, neither pure empire nor pure church.
  - **Protestantism**. Torn from Catholic Europe's belly by Reformation and revolution, a new religio-political entity arose. This was and is a different mixture of politics and religion.
  - **Modern Israel**. The Jewish people were ripped from Europe by a Caesarian section during the Nazi Holocaust.
  - **Spiritual Israel (including the Church)**. This is the true Kingdom of God, not identified with any human political entity and composed of all true believers down through history.

Of the six entities above, five are mortal. They will come to an end. That includes the Roman Catholic Church and political Protestantism (such as what once governed the United States and many other nations). Only the true church will last for eternity. It will be fully manifested as a perfected visible and political entity only when Christ returns.

To understand the table, first a word about the most dramatic phases of a woman's life:

  - Birth (a time to be born)
  - Puberty (varies, but falls during the times to weep or laugh)
  - Marriage (often during a time to mourn)
  - Pregnancy (often during a time to dance)
  - Childbirth (a time to tear)
  - Post Partum recovery (a time to mend)
  - death

Each of those life phases maps to a critical development in the history of an empire or cultural 
entity. In the table, birth is colored green, puberty blue, marriage and pregnancy pink, 
childbirth and recovery orange, and death red. Most cells in the table are left blank, to 
emphasize the events that match these key phases. If you are curious about what goes in the missing cells, 
every one of the times of Solomon is matched to a historical event for the whole of world history 
in the chapter "A Grand Father Clock & a Silver Cord", summarized in 
[Celestial Clocks](./celestial-clocks.html). Israel and the Church are similarly treated
in multiple chapters and summarized in the same article.
