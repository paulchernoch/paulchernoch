This article shares what the author has learned about how to interpret dreams.
The main takeaways are:

  - Who sent the dream? Not all dreams are messages from God. Learn to discern.
  - Does the dream align with other sources of wisdom? No valid dream will contradict the Bible.
  - Does the dream bear good fruit? God means us good. The devil means to destroy.

## Types of Dreams

Eighteen books in the Bible speak of dreams. How are dreams regarded by the prophets and apostles?

  1. As a divine promise (Gen 28, 37, 40) or offer (1 Kings 3)
  2. As commands from God to take specific positive action (Matthew 1)
  3. As commands from God to refrain from taking action (Gen 31; Matthew 27)
  4. As warnings from God to save people in danger (Matthew 2)
  5. As predictions of future events, enabling the wise to plan ahead (Gen 31, 41; Judges 7)
  6. As predictions of future judgment, affording the humble opportunity to change course (Gen 20; Daniel 4)
  7. As predictions of unalterable future judgment (Gen 40; Daniel 2; Daniel 7, Revelation)
  8. As clear rebukes from God of past actions, affording the contrite opportunity to repent
  9. As a lesser form of communication than hearing God's direct words (Numbers 12)
  10. As a charismatic gift without regard to what is communicated (Daniel 5; Joel 2; Acts 2)
  11. As unclear nightmares sent by God to correct and rescue those going astray (Job 33)
  12. As nightmares from an unknown source, possibly Satanic (Job 7)
  13. As the day's cares and worries given new form (Ecclesiastes 5)
  14. As a metaphor for transitory, unreliable things easily dispelled (Job 20; Psalms 73, 90; Isaiah 29)
  15. As a metaphor for an impossibly good outcome (Psalm 126)
  16. As romantic longing (Song of Songs 3)
  17. As negligence, asleep on the job (Isaiah 56)
  18. As unwise speculations or leaning on actual dreams not from God (Colossians 2; Jude)
  19. As lies told by false prophets (Deuteronomy 13; Jeremiah 23, 27, 29; Zechariah 10)
  20. As deceptions sent by evil spirits (Job 4)
  21. As suppressed by God in judgment (1 Sam 28)

Dreams are dangerous. 

  - Ignore a true dream from God and you will go astray or lose a blessing.
  - Misinterpret a dream and you may make a mess of things.
  - Misuse your dreams in pride to gain status in the church and you will be judged.
  - Embrace a false dream from the enemy and you place your soul in jeopardy.

With this diversity of the possible species of meaning (or meaninglessness) of dreams, 
how can anyone safely make use of them? I know of only one person granted the ability to
correctly discern the truth from among all these types of dreams.

#### ... and Daniel had understanding in **all visions and dreams**.
###### - Daniel 1:17

I am no Daniel. I have not personally experienced all of the types of dream listed above.
I have experienced some (actually most of them). God has warned me away from folly. 
He has warned me of danger. He has prepared me for difficulty. He has disciplined me for not listening.
I have also heeded dreams that were not from God and suffered dearly for it.
Nightmares from Satan destabilized my emotional life for years. All these experiences 
have taught me that you must be careful how you interpret and act on dreams. 
The Bible offers much guidance and we should not neglect it. The most important
thing to know is that you should **never act solely on the basis of a dream**.
We are given other sources of wisdom that we must combine with our dreams in 
order to understand them aright.

## The Power of a God-given Dream

Let's start with the up-side. By God's grace, shortly after I became a Christian,
I had a powerful and positive dream that permanently changed me for the better.
This showed me the promise of what a dream from God can accomplish, but gave me a 
one-sided view of things that would need correcting later.

It was the fall of 1985. I had just started my undergrad physics thesis. A month before,
I joined a good Bible study sponsored by the United Christian Fellowship, a group
formed by the merger of several campus Christian groups, including Intervarsity (IVCF).
I was struggling as a student and suffering depression, anxiety and other emotional problems.
I felt like a failure who had not made any positive contribution to the world.
This is called the "existential fear of life", the fear of living a wasted life.
I was also afraid of death. My fear of death was closely tied to my fear of life.
If I died, my life would have been an incomplete waste of time.

That Fall I had a recurring dream. In the dream, I was in bed, shaving with my electric razor.
As I shaved, the razor shorted and I was electrocuted. As the shock passed through my body, 
I knew I was about to die. However, instead of feeling scared, incomplete or worthless, 
my last thought as the dream ended was that I was going to be with Jesus. I was filled with
peace.

Since that month, I have never been afraid of dying. Nor have I fear that my life is worthless.
My ambition was taken from me. I no longer felt the need to strive to be accepted. 
Jesus accepted me the way I was. Even if I accomplished no more in this life than I already had,
it was enough.

I knew that the dream was from the Lord. It changed me. It healed me. It was mysterious.
I never thought to question where it came from. Only decades later did I make the connection.
A month before the dreams started, my Bible study leader had us memorize a passage from Galatians:

#### I have been crucified with Christ. 
#### It is no longer I who live, 
#### but Christ who lives in me. 
#### And the life I now live in the flesh I live 
#### by faith in the Son of God, who loved me 
#### and gave himself for me. 
#### I do not nullify the grace of God, 
#### for if righteousness were through the law, 
#### then Christ died for no purpose.
###### - Galatians 2:20-21

I did understand the words that I had memorized, but they changed me.
Those words are about putting on a new identity in Christ. That new
person need fear nothing and is perfect in the eyes of God, accepted
and loved and forgiven. That dream was just my heart catching up with
what the words were doing inside my soul. 

This is the first and most important lesson of dreams:

**Does your dream align with the Word of God? Does it leap forth from that Word?**

The second lesson is that this dream brought peace. Not all dreams must bring peace.
Some are to judge, to discipline, or to warn. They lead to peace only if you heed them.

There is a special reason for mentioning this dream first. It came true twice.
It makes me choke up just thinking about it. My father and I had a difficult relationship
for decades. In the last decade of his life, things improved markedly and we became close.
Even so, I prayed many times for him to soften his anger at God and trust in Jesus.
He was raised Catholic but grew bitter in his middle years. He often ridiculed my faith.
Towards the end, when his health was failing, he told us not to revive him if anything happened.
Then he told my wife on the phone, "God isn't done with me yet." He had a heart attack,
but because of what my wife said, we told the doctors to revive him. My dad told us afterwards,
"I need to take care of Martha." His wife was in worse shape than him and he would not let go
so long as she was alive.

I continued to pray for my father and the Lord led me to the passage about the sheep and the goats.
Some of the sheep said, "When did we ever do anything for you?" But Jesus assured them that
if they did something good for the least of his brothers, they also did for him.
In the last few years of his life, my dad became a father to my wife, whose own father had been cruel. 
The change in his personality and kindness he showed us was evidence that he was a different man. 
My wife and I are Jesus' brother and sister, so my father did show the Lord kindness.
God gave me peace while reading a book on the doctrine of blessed assurance that my father would 
go to heaven.

During COVID-19, my dad's condition worsened. I visited him at the hospital. He asked me to do 
him a favor. He wanted me to fetch his electric razor from his apartment. I got it and recharged 
or replaced the batteries. I shot a video of him shaving with his razor, sitting on his hospital bed.
It is the last picture we have of him before he died a few days later.

God knew. Decades ago, when I first had that dream, God knew. He knew I would one day be in torment over
whether my father would go to heaven or not. He gave me a dream about being at peace with Jesus
at the hour of my death, with a razor in my hand. It was not enough for God to send me a dream 
to let me know that MY life was not a waste. He also used the same dream to tell me that my FATHER'S
life was not a waste.

That is the good that a dream from God can do. Now, for the bad news.
