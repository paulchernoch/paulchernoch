## Abstract

#### For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free 
#### in Christ Jesus from **the law of sin and death**.
###### - Romans 8:2

The Apostle Paul contrasts two laws. The first is the old covenant of Moses, called the law of sin and death. 
It is able to condemn but not justify. Then there is the new covenant of grace, called the law of the spirit of life.
That law is able to impart eternal life. This is a confusing topic for new believers. Paul both attacks the
old covenant and continues to insist that people not murder, steal, commit adultery, worship idols or lie.
How is that not exactly the same?

This article, originally published as the chapter "Matthew and the Law of Christ" in the book 
*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, provides a helpful guide to understanding what exactly is this "Law of Christ".
It builds upon the previous article [Which Ten Commandments?](./which-ten-commandments.html) to 
divide the Gospel of Matthew according to the Law Pattern. Each pair of chapters in Matthew corresponds
to one of the fourteen imperative statements found in the Ten Commandments. What doe this mean?
It means that there are two chapters of gospel commentary for each imperative that explain the new
way in which we are to walk according to those commandments, an expanded view of each given straight by Jesus.
So when Paul speaks of "the Law of Christ", it is not a rhetorical flourish, nor is it devoid of
significant content. Jesus did law down this new law and we can trace its shape. We do not need to be confused
any more.
