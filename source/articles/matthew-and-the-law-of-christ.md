## Abstract

#### For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free 
#### in Christ Jesus from **the law of sin and death**.
###### - Romans 8:2

The Apostle Paul contrasts two laws. The first is the old covenant of Moses, called the law of sin and death. 
It is able to condemn but not justify. Then there is the new covenant of grace, called the law of the spirit of life.
That law is able to impart eternal life. This is a confusing topic for new believers. Paul both attacks the
old covenant and continues to insist that people not murder, steal, commit adultery, worship idols or lie.
How is that not exactly the same?

This article, originally published as the chapter "Matthew and the Law of Christ" in the book 
*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, provides a helpful guide to understanding what exactly is this "Law of Christ".
It builds upon the previous article [Which Ten Commandments?](./which-ten-commandments.html) to 
divide the Gospel of Matthew according to the Law Pattern. Each pair of chapters in Matthew corresponds
to one of the fourteen imperative statements found in the Ten Commandments. What does this mean?
It means that there are two chapters of gospel commentary for each imperative that explain the new
way in which we are to walk according to those commandments, an expanded view of each given straight by Jesus.
So when Paul speaks of "the Law of Christ", it is not a rhetorical flourish, nor is it devoid of
significant content. Jesus did lay down this new law and we can trace its shape. We do not need to be confused
any more.

## Matthew and the Law of Christ

#### Bear one another's burdens, 
##### and so fulfill the law of Christ. 
###### - Galatians 6:2

#### To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. 
#### To those under the law I became as one under the law
#### (though not being myself under the law) that I might win 
#### those under the law. To those outside the law 
#### I became as one outside the law (not being outside 
#### the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I
#### might win those outside the law. 
###### - 1 Corinthians 9:20-21

In the previous chapter, we saw the Gospel process of salvation hidden in a psalm about
the Law. Now we shall uncover the Law hidden in a Gospel.

What is the law of Christ? Paul wrote extensively about the change from living under the
law to living under grace. In Peace, the chapter “Appendix I: A Clock for Timothy” shows
that 1&2 Timothy are structured according to the Ten Commandments. You can take a
deep dive into Pauline theology to figure out this “law of Christ”. Alternatively, you can
head to the Gospel of Matthew.

When I began crafting the conclusion to this book, I pulled together the patterns from
*Peace* and this book (*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*) and other fruits of my research. I scribbled notes on many pieces of
paper then stood back to see if I could distill all I had learned into a compact description
of the heart of wisdom. In doing so, when I got to the heart of Matthew, I noticed passages
that matched the heart of the Ten Commandments expressed as fourteen imperative
statements. The two central imperatives are to not work on the seventh day and to honor
your father and mother. Lo and behold, the middle chapters of Matthew call Jesus the
Lord of the Sabbath and then discuss the fifth commandment. I hoped it was a
coincidence because this book is already twice as long as I planned for. No dice.

(At the start of *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* was a chart that you can use to compare 
the several patterns developed in the book. It is reproduced below. 
The last pattern to be explained appears in the chapter “Epilogue: The Fifth Commandment”. 
That is the Motherhood Pattern.)

<img src="images/patterns-correlated.png" alt="Many wisdom patterns correlated" width="800" height="600" />

The next day I dissected Matthew and all doubt was removed. In addition to the Harvest
and Growth Patterns, Matthew also conforms to the precise structure of the
commandments. Each pair of chapters matches one imperative, fourteen pairs in all. Some
matches are direct, with commentary framed to discuss that commandment. Others
expand the scope of the command. Yet others speak of the opposite of the command, the
positive sense of how to do right instead of avoid wrong. 
Lastly, there are examples of Jesus or others obeying the command through righteous acts, 
or disobeying the command through sin.

So many patterns! Matthew is far more complex than I ever knew. With this addition,
the larger story of the gospel comes into view. The most granular pattern is the Growth
Pattern of Solomon’s twenty-eight times. The path to mature obedience and fruitfulness
takes time. The next level is this new Law Pattern of fourteen steps. As we mature we are
able to follow God’s laws with greater sincerity, perseverance, and fidelity. We are learning
to obey God. The next level is the Harvest Pattern of seven steps, where we learn to be
fruitful. Then the top level returns to the most important commandments, to love God
and neighbor, which in Jesus become one.

Mature, obedient, fruitful, loving.

28, 14, 7, 2.

Reinterpreting Matthew in the light of the Law Pattern could be the subject of an entire
book. The following will identify which passages match each imperative but only provide
extended discussion for connections that are not obvious. Then by combining what is said
in Peace about the Harvest and Growth Patterns in Matthew and what this book says about
the Law Pattern, you will be able to see three intersecting lines of thought as they touch
each chapter. Every chapter can then be seen in relation to the whole, making connections
and trends of thought clear that are easily overlooked.

In the sections below, the commandments are divided into fourteen parts, corresponding to the 
fourteen imperative statements. Each imperative statement is addressed by Jesus in two chapters
of Matthew. By this logic, Matthew will devote six chapters to the sabbath, as it comprises three parts.
This is significant.

  - 1: Np other Gods
  - 2a: No Making idols
  - 2b: No worshiping idols
  - 3: No vain speech
  - 4a: Keep the Sabbath holy
  - 4b: Work six days
  - 4c: Don't work on the sevenh day
  - 5: Honor father & mother
  - 6: No murder
  - 7: No adultery
  - 8: No stealing
  - 9: No lying
  - 10a: No coveting neighbor's house
  - 10b: No coveting neighbor's wife

## 1: (Matthew 1-2)

#### **I am the Lord your God,** 
#### **who brought you out of the land of Egypt,**
#### **out of the house of slavery.**
#### **You shall have no other gods before me.**

Both the preamble and first imperative find expression in the first two chapters of
Matthew. The Egypt connection between preamble and gospel is clear in chapter 2:

#### Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord 
#### appeared to Joseph in a dream and said,
##### **“Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt**, 
##### and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about 
##### to search for the child, to destroy him.” 
#### And he rose and took the child and his mother by night
#### and departed to Egypt and remained there until the 
#### death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had
#### spoken by the prophet, 
##### **“Out of Egypt I called my son**.” 
###### - Matthew 2:13-15

Prior to this, when the angel spoke to Joseph, the connection to the imperative is made:

#### “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
#### and they shall call his name Immanuel”
#### (which means, God with us). 
###### - Matthew 1:23

This introduces the great controversy. We are not to worship anything “on the earth
beneath”, yet now God has come upon the earth in the form of a man. His deity is
reinforced later, when the wise men visit:

#### And going into the house they saw the child with Mary
#### his mother, and **they fell down and worshiped him**. 
#### Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, 
#### gold and frankincense and myrrh.
###### - Matthew 2:11

We are only permitted to worship God. Jesus is God.

## 2a: (Matthew 3-4)

#### **You shall not make for yourself a carved image,**
#### **or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above,**
#### **or that is in the earth beneath,**
#### **or that is in the water under the earth.**

The word idol does not crop up in these chapters. However, one troublesome form for
an idol and two materials commonly used to make idols are described in a mysterious way
by John the Baptist:

#### But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees 
#### coming to his baptism, he said to them, 
##### "You brood of **vipers**! Who warned you to flee from 
##### the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
##### And do not presume to say to yourselves, 
###### ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ 
##### for I tell you, God is able from these **stones** to raise up 
##### children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the 
##### root of the **trees**. Every **tree** therefore that does not bear 
##### good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
###### - Matthew 3:7-10

Concerning the viper, the Jews once worshiped the image of a snake, but Hezekiah
destroyed it:

#### He removed the high places and broke the pillars 
#### and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the
#### bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days 
#### the people of Israel had made offerings to it 
#### (it was called Nehushtan). 
###### - 2 Kings 18:4

Likewise, pagan altars were often built from stones and topped with wooden Asherah
poles. The irony in John’s words is sharp. People are not supposed to worship lifeless
things of stone and wood, yet John says that God can turn those lifeless stones into
children of Abraham, while those who are technically children of Abraham are like idols
made of wood, trees fit only to be burned.

In the next chapter, when Jesus is tempted by the devil (4:1-11), stones make another
appearance. Jesus refuses to turn stones into bread. By doing this, Jesus is refusing to turn
his appetite and divine power into an idol that will serve him. Jesus came to serve, not be
served. As for refusing to jump off the temple, Jesus refused to allow even the temple to
become an idol to be worshiped. Finally, Jesus refuses to bow down and worship the devil,
who qualifies as a being from “heaven above”.

## 2b: (Matthew 5-6)

#### **You shall not bow down to them or serve them,**
#### **for I the Lord your God am a jealous God,**
#### **visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children**
#### **to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,**
#### **but showing steadfast love to thousands of those**
#### **who love me and keep my commandments.**

Chapters 5 and 6 do not focus on not worshiping idols, they focus on true and
acceptable worship. The attitude of acceptable worship is revealed via the Beatitudes
(5:3-12). The actions of acceptable worship are itemized in both chapters. That includes
taking oaths (5:33-37), alms giving (6:1-4), praying (6:5-15), and fasting (6:16-18).

Jesus does address the worship of idols, but indirectly, by shining light on the heart
attitude behind that idolatry. Humanity’s number one idol is money. Jesus urges us to
store up treasures in heaven (6:19-24) instead of things that moth and rust destroy. He then
extends the scope of such idolatry to anxiety over food and clothing (6:25-34).

Jesus’ most startling claim is how he defines his relationship to the law:

#### **Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets;** 
#### **I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.** 
#### For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, 
#### not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until 
#### all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the 
#### least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same 
#### will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever 
#### does them and teaches them will be called great in 
#### the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness 
#### exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never 
#### enter the kingdom of heaven.
###### - Matthew 5:17-20

As we continue to march through the gospel, keep this in mind. Jesus’ words are not
rhetorical hyperbole. With Jesus’ life, ministry and teaching conforming explicitly to the
Ten Commandments, he really does fulfill the law.

## 3: (Matthew 7-8)

#### **You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,**
#### **for the Lord will not hold him guiltless**
#### **who takes his name in vain.**

Taking the Lord’s name in vain encompasses more than swearing. When we manipulate
others by claiming our words come from God when they do not, that is vain speech. Jesus
here warns of false prophets. (7:15-20)

When we call “Lord, Lord” to request help but habitually break God’s law in secret, that
is vain speech. (7:21-23)

When we call on God for help but doubt His love and ability to help us, that is vain
speech. (7:7-11)

Stepping into chapter eight, Jesus transitions from teacher of the law to doer of the law.
After cleansing a leper, he directs the man to follow the law:

#### And Jesus said to him, 
##### “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, 
##### show yourself to the priest and offer the gift 
##### that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” 
###### - Matthew 8:4

Then Jesus is astonished at the faith of a centurion (8:5-13). That man unwaveringly
believed that the Lord had the authority and ability to heal his servant. When he asks,
seeks and knocks, and calls “Lord, Lord”, the Lord answers.

## 4a: (Matthew 9-10)

#### **Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.**

## 4b: (Matthew 11-12)

#### **Six days you shall labor, and do all your work,**

## 4c: (Matthew 13-14)

#### **but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.**
#### **On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son,** 
#### **or your daughter, your male servant, or** 
#### **your female servant, or your livestock,**
#### **or the sojourner who is within your gates.**
#### **For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,**
#### **and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day.**
#### **Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.**

The Sabbath commandment, being distributed among three imperatives, finds
expression in six chapters of Matthew. When Jesus performed miracles on the Sabbath, the
religious authorities interpreted this as disobedience to God’s law. These chapters tackle
holiness, work and rest in a perplexing sequence consistent with Christ’s controversial
stance.

The Jewish leaders considered Sabbath observance to be the most important ritual in
Judaism. Some modern Jewish commentators assert that shabbat is mentioned more often
in the Tanakh than any other Jewish religious practice. Even some Christian
denominations, like the Seventh Day Adventists, consider the Sabbath commandment to
be the most important. Most Christians look at what Jesus said and did and come to the
opposite conclusion. The irony is that this six chapter focus shows that Jesus agreed with
the teachers of the law! A fifth of this gospel is devoted to the controversy over how to
keep the sabbath holy. Jesus disputed not its importance but the spirit in which to observe
it.

What does it mean to keep the Sabbath holy? It means that holy people congregate in a
holy place at a holy time to worship a holy God. Jesus showed a new way to satisfy all these
requirements and it got him in trouble. Jesus met with unholy people, like Matthew the
tax collector and his tax collecting friends (9:9-13), a sinful, paralytic man whom Jesus
both forgave and healed (9:1-8), and a demon-oppressed man (9:32-34). How was this okay?
Because Jesus made them holy!

When Jesus met in an unholy place (Matthew’s house), he sanctified it by his presence.
Sadly, he reported on the unholy things that would soon be done in supposedly holy
synagogues by saying, *“Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their
synagogues.”* (10:17)

The other gospels make much of the fact that some healings Jesus performed on the
Sabbath, offending the Pharisees’ sense of time. Matthew does not specify for most of
these healings if they occurred then, but he does address the issue of understanding when
God’s timing for special seasons in salvation history override convention. Jesus was
questioned about why his disciples did not fast like the Pharisees did (9:14-17). Now we
know that when he was tempted by the devil, he fasted forty days, then later taught about
the proper way to fast. Jesus is showing that we have liberty in how we structure our time
in service and worship.

More importantly, Jesus was not working on the Sabbath to satisfy his own need for
food or money. Jesus was working to set people free from bondage to disease and sin so
that they might for once enter into the peace of God from which they had long been
excluded. He makes the startling declaration that he is the Lord of the Sabbath (12:1-8).
One example of Jesus exercising this authority is the restoration of a man’s withered hand
(12:9-14). This was explicitly stated as occurring on the Sabbath. When challenged about
this, Jesus shames them by showing that they care more about sheep than people:

#### He said to them, 
##### “Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls 
##### into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it 
##### and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man 
##### than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” 
#### Then he said to the man, 
##### “Stretch out your hand.” 
#### And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, 
#### healthy like the other.
###### - Matthew 12:11-13

Jesus calls this great work of setting people free the harvest. He called for people to pray
to the Lord of the Harvest to send workers into the harvest field (9:35-38). Do not
overlook this! Jesus did not arrogate the right to change the times set in the law. He prayed
for God to authorize people to work extended hours to accomplish this compassionate
task. Then in the next chapter, Jesus actually sends his disciples out into the harvest field
(9:1-42). This identifies Jesus as the Lord of the Harvest.

Since he is both the Lord of the Sabbath and Lord of the Harvest, he is lord of both the
six days of work and the one day of rest. Since he is the recipient of prayers and the one
who by offering forgiveness makes people holy, Jesus is the Holy God that we are to
worship on the Sabbath. That makes any house where he stays a synagogue or temple.

With heavy taxes, occupation by Rome, and disease and oppression of every kind, the
people needed rest. In chapter 11, corresponding to the command to work six days, Jesus
says the opposite, calling the people to rest, because the people needed rest today, not
tomorrow:

#### Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, 
#### and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, 
#### and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, 
#### and you will find rest for your souls. 
#### For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
###### - Matthew 11:28-30

Then when we get to chapter 13, corresponding to the command to do no work on the
seventh day, Jesus gives the Parable of the Sower and others related to the great work of
harvesting souls for the kingdom.

Finally, chapter 14 gives examples of Jesus working so that others may have peace. He
feeds the 5,000 (14:13-21) and heals the sick (14:34-36). In between these two miracles Jesus
performs an essential service. The afflicted are not the only ones who need a savior. The
faithful who answer the call to the mission field are subject to persecution and hardship.
Like the disciples, afraid of the waves and terrified at the sight of Jesus walking upon the
sea (14:22-33), we need our anchor in the storm. Any day, any hour, can usher in our
sabbath rest.

## 5: (Matthew 15-16)

#### **Honor your father and your mother,**
#### **that your days may be long in the land**
#### **that the Lord your God is giving you.**

Chapter 15 gives precept and example. Jesus rebukes people for using religious rules to
allow them to wiggle out of fulfilling responsibilities that they had toward their parents
under this commandment (15:1-9). When I was a new believer, I was guilty of this. It is
easy for a son or daughter to clothe ordinary resentments in the religious garb of perceived
persecution and justify isolating themself from family gatherings and chores.

Backing up a chapter, we have the example of Salome “honoring” her mother by
demanding of her father the death of John the Baptist (14:1-12). Yes, Herod was a great
sinner, but his daughter dishonored him by making such a wicked request.

Contrast this with the Canaanite woman who begs Jesus to heal her daughter (15:21-28).
She made a dangerous journey, endured the scornful looks of the Jews who despised all
such pagans as well as the sharp answer from Jesus: “It is not right to take the children's bread
and throw it to the dogs.” This mother endured dishonor to save her daughter. For this, the
remembrance of her great faith and honor as a mother are preserved for all eternity in this
gospel story. By this, Jesus calls all mothers and fathers to be honorable parents by risking
all to care for their children.

In chapter 16, Jesus honors his Father in Heaven. He does this by acknowledging two
things: a blessing received from the Father in the present and a blessing anticipated by
faith that He trusts the Father will bestow in the future. The present blessing is upon Peter
and would lead to the founding of the Church:

#### Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, 
#### he asked his disciples, 
##### “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” 
#### And they said, 
##### “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others
##### Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 
#### He said to them, 
##### “But who do you say that I am?” 
#### Simon Peter replied,
##### “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” 
#### And Jesus answered him, 
##### **“Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah**! For flesh and blood 
##### has not revealed this to you, but **my Father who is in heaven**.
###### - Matthew 16:13-17

The future blessing is upon Jesus and all whom he shall reward with grace and vindicate
by justice on the day he returns:

#### For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels 
#### in the **glory of his Father**, and then he will repay
#### each person according to what he has done.
###### - Matthew 16:27

Due to the interplay between the Harvest, Growth and Law Patterns, there are two
important examples related to honoring Jesus’ mother which are slightly out of place, in
chapters 12 & 13. There is a reason for this. Back in “Which Ten Commandments”, Jesus
was specially identified with the center imperatives of resting on the Sabbath day and
honoring Father and Mother. Thus chapters 12 & 13 show the vital unity of these two
commandments which define Jesus as both God and Man. These chapters declare Jesus as
the Lord of the Sabbath and Son of Man (12:8; 13:37). Consider then how his humanity
was regarded:

#### While he was still speaking to the people, behold, 
#### his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak
#### to him. But he replied to the man who told him, 
##### “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
#### And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, 
##### “Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does 
##### the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and 
##### sister and mother.”
###### - Matthew 12:46-49

In *Peace*, this was shown to be an emotional riddle. An emotional riddle is a Bible
statement whose true meaning is hidden behind the negative emotional response that the
statement evokes. Only a person who perseveres in faith, refuses to throw away the
Scripture by calling it errant or uninspired, and implores God to explain it will find its
true meaning. Thus Paul’s command that women be silent and not teach in 1 Timothy was
a riddle pointing to a later time, “a time to be silent”, which would immediately precede “a
time to speak” when women would be permitted to speak as leaders and teachers in the
church. That verse was a test of men, to see if they would ever treat women as equals. It was
a test of women, to see if they would obey in submission for over a millennium. It remains
a test of the church to see if they would exegete it with integrity. It is a test of unbelievers
to see if they will trust a savior whose words they do not understand.

In the present emotional riddle, the emotion is either anger that Jesus is insulting his
mother or umbrage that his family expects special status. A typical Protestant might be
happy with this as on the surface it contradicts Roman Catholic teachings about the
unique role of Mary. However, being adjacent to the chapters about honoring one’s father
and mother, it is intentionally provocative.

We can take this statement as a put down of Mary or an elevation of all who obey the
Father’s will to like status with Mary. The fifth commandment receives special mention by
Paul:

#### “Honor your father and mother” 
#### (**this is the first commandment with a promise**), 
#### “that it may go well with you and that you may 
#### live long in the land.”
###### - Ephesians 6:2-3

Do you see what Jesus has done? The Ten Commandments are mostly about what we
should not do, with no explicit blessing for obedience except this solitary command.
(There is an implicit blessing of continued freedom from slavery.) By doing this thing,
equating the faithful with his mother and brothers, Jesus is free to extend his love and
honor to all. Now when he honors his mother, having made all believers into his mothers,
sisters and brothers, that honor overflows to the whole church. He has turned the Law into
Grace! All this springs from our being adopted into God’s family. It is as John said:

#### But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, 
#### **he gave the right to become children of God**, who were born, 
#### not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of 
#### the will of man, but of God.
###### - John 1:12-13

In *Peace*, the other side of this question was examined. We are called to do more than
change our view of how faith affects the status of our earthly relationships. If ordinary
believers are elevated to like status with Jesus’ family, what is the status of that family? For
we know that Mary obeyed the angel and the Father when she undertook the difficult
mission of becoming the mother of our Lord. So the Bible challenges us to ask concerning
Mary, “Who is my mother?”

As related in *Peace*, during the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church began to ask
that question in earnest. Saint Anselm, Eadmer, and other theologians posed the question
and began to formulate an answer. They sought to understand who Mary is, what her role
in the church is, and how they might honor her. During that era, the food supply doubled,
life expectancy increased from 25 to 35 years, and the population doubled. By this and
other prophetic connections related in that book, it is clear that there is something special
about Mary, and honoring her releases blessings from Heaven. In the Magnificat, Mary
said that all generations shall call her blessed. As a loving, compassionate believer in the
Savior, surely she shares that blessing with Christians in need throughout all generations!

As a counter example, consider not Jesus’ words but those of neighbors from his
hometown:

#### And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went 
#### away from there, and coming to his hometown he taught them 
#### in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, 
##### “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? 
##### **Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary?**
##### And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? 
##### And are not all his sisters with us?  
##### Where then did this man get all these things?” 
#### And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, 
##### “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown 
##### and in his own household.” 
#### **And he did not do many mighty works there, because of**
#### **their unbelief.**
###### - Matthew 13:53-58

Like Job’s friends, they discounted the possibility that anyone born of woman could be
Messiah. Like all people, they judged Jesus according to his social status. Carpenter’s son.
Mary’s child. Fatherless. Brothers and sisters of no account. Galilean. Average looking.
Human. They are rejecting the possibility that God can become incarnate in a form both
human and divine. That is part of the unbelief that prevented Jesus from working many
miracles. It is not its source.

The source of this unbelief in Jesus springs from the first two pieces of evidence cited by
the people for mistrusting him: his father and mother. The people dishonored Jesus’ father
Joseph and mother Mary. No honoring of Jesus’ parents means no promised blessing. I am
a Baptist, a Calvinist Protestant, but logic, history and Scripture compel me to accept that
there is something about Mary that we do not understand. So have you ever prayed, “Who
is Jesus’ mother?”

## 6: (Matthew 17-18)

#### **You shall not murder.**

If someone wishes to dispute the present structured categorization of Matthew by the
commandments, this would be a good place to start. Murder shows up everywhere. Herod
tried to kill Jesus in chapter 2. The devil tried to get Jesus to jump off the temple in
chapter 4. Jesus likened anger to murder in the Sermon on the Mount (5:21-26). The
Romans crucified Jesus in chapter 27.

What sets these two chapters apart is that they describe what Jesus is going to do about
murder. Adding to what he said in chapter 5, Jesus condemns in 18:1-9 all who lead
children or anyone else astray. This will fall heavily on public school teachers and college
professors who proclaim lies that contradict the Bible. Since the end state of a person who
is lured away from the truth is eternal damnation, corrupt teachers are to be punished the
same as murderers.

Yet God in his mercy will not stand idly by as these deceivers spread corruption. In the
Parable of the Lost Sheep (18:10-13), Jesus promises to seek out the lost and bring them
back to the truth. Then he proclaims a message of forgiveness in 18:14-19. Of course this is
tempered by a requirement that those who are forgiven also forgive others, as told in the
Parable of the Unmerciful Servant (18:20-34).

If chapter 18 holds Jesus’ plan, chapter 17 describes the obstacle Jesus had to overcome to
get the spiritual authority and power to accomplish that plan. At the close of the scene
where Jesus was transfigured upon the mountain, he says this:

#### And as they were coming down the mountain, 
#### Jesus commanded them, 
##### “Tell no one the vision, **until the Son of Man is raised** 
##### **from the dead**.” 
#### And the disciples asked him, 
##### “Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?” 
#### He answered, 
##### “Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.
##### But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they 
##### did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. 
##### **So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands**.” 
#### Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them 
#### of John the Baptist.
###### - Matthew 17:9-13

To reinforce this, he soon after said this:

#### As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 
##### “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the
##### hands of men, **and they will kill him**, and he will 
##### be raised on the third day.” 
#### And they were greatly distressed.
###### - Matthew 17:21-22

To rid the world of murder, Jesus had to let himself be murdered. That is how hard it is
to stop us humans from killing each other. That is how heavy a price had to be paid.
When Jesus said he would fulfill the law completely, he did not exaggerate. He follows that
law so that we may receive grace.

## 7: (Matthew 19-20)

#### **You shall not commit adultery.**

In chapter 19, Jesus speaks out against adultery (19:18) and divorce (19:1-12). When he
does this, he connects these sins to some of the evil effects they cause, like harm to
children (19:13-15). Altogether, Jesus is reinforcing the necessity of healthy families in
promoting a healthy and happy life.

The next chapter seems at first blush not to have anything to do with adultery. This is a
case where having a commandment framework adds value. If Matthew 20 addresses
adultery, then what kind? The first clue is in the story of the mother of two disciples
soliciting Jesus for top positions in his kingdom. Jesus answered, 
*“You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to **drink the cup that I am to drink**?”* 
*They said to him, “We are able.”* (Matthew 20:22) Drinking a cup can mean several things in Scripture, 
but the connotation here is suffering. Jesus is righteous, so his suffering is undeserved persecution; 
he again predicts his death in 20:19. In Revelation, we have the cup of God’s wrath against the
adulterous false religion of Babylon:

#### For all the nations have drunk
#### the maddening wine of her adulteries.
#### The kings of the earth committed adultery with her,
#### and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”
###### - Revelation 18:3, NIV

When Jesus drinks the cup, his motive is pure. The two disciples and their mother,
however, walk this road for pride, the core sin of Satan’s religion.

With the insight that this chapter concerns the adultery of false religion, another story
make sense. The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard is not about just any old workers.
They are evangelists, missionaries and pastors. The attitude of entitlement pitting the early
workers in a mission field against those who complete the task is also pride, but tinged
with greed. As Paul observed, many see Christ as a means for earthly gain.

The remaining story on the surface is about two loud mouthed blind men whose bold
faith leads to their receiving their sight. The underlying religious story is that the
bystanders were annoyed at the men for disrupting Jesus’ teaching. Are propriety, order,
tradition, comfort and manners more important than love? Not to Jesus. He refused to let
religion get in the way of welcoming people into the Kingdom of God.

## 8: (Matthew 21-22)

#### **You shall not steal.**

Chapter 21 starts off with a peculiar introduction to theft. Roman soldiers could compel
a person to carry their gear, which is a theft of services, but authorized by Roman law. In
the first story (21:1-11), Jesus has his servants borrow a donkey and its colt to be used to
bear Jesus on his entrance into Jerusalem. Jesus instructs his disciples, “If anyone says
anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” (21:3) By
this, he shows that though he is the commander of the heavenly host, he obtains
permission from its owner even to borrow a beast for a day. In this way, Jesus sanctifies
property ownership.

The next pericope attacks legalized theft in a religious context.

#### And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all 
#### who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the
#### tables of the money-changers and the seats of those 
#### who sold pigeons. He said to them, 
##### “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ 
##### **but you make it a den of robbers**.”
###### - Matthew 21:12-13

When a person offers a sacrifice at the temple, it is often to atone for guilt and receive
forgiveness. God’s purpose in this is to remove the burden of sin from their heart. The
money changers, by taking their cut and jacking up the prices for purchasing animals for
sacrifice, added to the penitent’s burden. By making religion a business, they rob God of
His glory and attach a financial obligation to His grace.

This grace is then expressed ironically when Jesus, after condemning the religious, offers
a place in his kingdom to the biggest thieves of all, tax collectors for Rome.

#### “… Jesus said to them, 
##### “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and 
##### the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. 
##### For John came to you in the way of righteousness, 
##### and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors 
##### and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, 
##### you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.” 
###### - Matthew 21:31b-32

There are surely people today who enjoy words like this where Jesus sticks it to the
religious people. Their pride rises up inside them, thinking that they get a free pass. I can’t
help thinking about the man who wrote these words down. I doubt that Matthew felt
pride as he dipped pen in reservoir and made each careful stroke. Every few seconds he
had to wipe tears from his face with his sleeve, lest they drip upon the parchment and ruin
his calligraphy. He had been one of those tax collectors. He knew how undeserving he was
to receive such a gift. Now the Lord was entrusting him to render an account of all these
marvelous deeds, to be slotted in first place in the New Testament. The weight of such a
blessing who can bear?

The Parable of the Tenants (21:33-45) shows us where theft leads: to murder. The tenants
rob the landowner first of their rent, then they kill his servants (the prophets) and finally
his son (Jesus). The immediate context for the vineyard is Israel, but by now it extends to
our whole world. We want to seize ownership from God and be our own masters. This will
not end well.

Chapter 22 steps back and shows there are two kinds property, matching two sources of
authority and obligation, earthly and heavenly.

#### Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to 
#### pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” 
#### But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, 
##### “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? 
##### Show me the coin for the tax.” 
#### And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, 
##### “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 
#### They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, 
##### “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, 
##### and to God the things that are God's.” 
#### When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him 
#### and went away.
###### - Matthew 22:17-22

We live in a world in which claims upon our time, talents and resources come from all
directions. We must sort them out. We must learn from Jesus how to prioritize them. The
reality that we cannot use religion, political philosophy or our worldview to get a pass
from any of them is infuriating. Jesus called it malice. We can grow to despise the people
and institutions that have legitimate claims upon us. This is a great burden and a great test
of faith.

## 9: (Matthew 23-24)

#### **You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.**

The whole of chapter 23 is devoted to one pernicious form of lying: religious hypocrisy.
Hypocrisy is revealed in its many facets:

  - Public observance of rules to hide private lawlessness
  - Missionary activity that reproduces the same deceptive lifestyle in new converts
  - Narrow focus on rule keeping at the expense of justice, mercy and faithfulness
  - Making oaths into lies by excusing people for breaking ones that do not involve money

Recall the third and ninth plagues on Egypt? They were the plagues of gnats (a minor
plague) and of darkness (a major one, which renders people blind). Darkness is symbolic
of lies, which conceal the truth, just as light is symbolic of truth.
Jesus connects those plagues to hypocrisy by these words:

#### You blind guides, straining out a gnat 
#### and swallowing a camel! 
###### - Matthew 23:23

A balanced faith does not focus on one area of morality and ethics at the expense of the
others. As James wrote,

#### **For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point** 
#### **has become accountable for all of it**. For he who said, 
#### “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” 
#### If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have 
#### become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act 
#### as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. 
#### For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. 
#### Mercy triumphs over judgment.
###### - James 2:10-13

Throughout Matthew, Jesus prefaces statements with “Truly, I say to you…” Moving on
to chapter 24 is no exception. Jesus countered the pleasant lies of false prophets with
devastating truths, like the coming destruction of the temple (24:1-2). Then he warned of
false prophets who speak religious lies (24:3-14). Some people will react to this by ignoring
all prophets, but that is equally dangerous, because the only way to endure calamity is to
accept and act on the truth: 

#### “And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed 
#### throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, 
#### and then the end will come.”
###### - Matthew 24:14

From verse 15 on, Jesus gives true details of what is to come to enable us to distinguish truth
from lies. The truth of these words is so monumentally important that Jesus attached to
them the highest level of assurance:

#### From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes
#### tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. 
#### So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, 
#### at the very gates. Truly, I say to you, this generation will not 
#### pass away until all these things take place. 
#### **Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.**
###### - Matthew 24:32-35

Of all the lies to be told by false prophets, Jesus saves this one for last: *“But if that wicked
servant says to himself, ‘**My master is delayed**’…”* (Matthew 24:48)

When the time set by the Father (24:36) and known only to him arrives, so will Jesus. He
will not be delayed.

As they say down under: Struth!

## 10a: (Matthew 25-26)

#### **You shall not covet your neighbor's house;**

There are far more things that we can covet beyond those listed in the commandment.
In these chapters, if you combine the surface and inner meanings, you get relationships,
religious status, real estate, money, and reputation, to name a few.

The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins (25:1-13) is about preparation, whether in
our normal work responsibilities or our role as Christians preparing the world for Christ’s
return. Why were some virgins not prepared for the bridegroom to arrive? We can call it
laziness, but what produced that laziness? Somebody else was getting married. If it was her
own wedding, every virgin would have been prepared. Jealousy towards the bride who was
getting married, instead of them, undermined their dedication to their work.

Some who have been entrusted with an important responsibility do not have feelings of
humble gratitude. In the Parable of the Talents (25:14-30), the third servant buries the
talent entrusted to him. Envy, anger, resentment and fear cripple him, so he refuses to take
a risk for his master to try to obtain a good return on the investment. He believes that all
the results of his labor should belong to him, not the man who staked him with the talent.
He covets the investor’s rightful share of the profits. God gave us everything we have,
starting with life. The obedience he commands and the return he expects of us are not
theft, they are the gift of purpose and significance. If we do not covet our master’s share
but industriously increase it, he will allow us to enter into his joy (25:21,23). The joy of
heaven is superior to all the wealth on earth. It is a spiritual treasure. Covetousness is built
upon a faulty appraisal of the value of things. The greedy are greedy for the perishable.
Their greed would be virtue if they craved the eternal pleasures of Heaven:

#### You make known to me the path of life;
#### you will fill me with joy in your presence,
#### with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
###### - Psalm 16:11, NIV

The separation of the sheep and goats (25:31-46) switches to the opposite of
covetousness, which is generosity.

#### For I was hungry and **you gave me food**,
#### I was thirsty and **you gave me drink**,
#### I was a stranger and **you welcomed me**,
#### I was naked and **you clothed me**,
#### I was sick and **you visited me**,
#### I was in prison and **you came to me**.’
###### - Matthew 25:35-36

The only way to overcome covetousness is to give. The joy of giving will displace the
empty satisfaction of merely keeping what is yours. Yet even that joy may be met with
derision and that generosity with opposition:

#### Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, 
#### a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very 
#### expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as 
#### he reclined at table. And when the disciples saw it, 
#### they were indignant, saying, 
##### “Why this waste? For this could have been sold for a large sum 
##### and given to the poor.” 
#### But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, 
##### “Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done 
##### a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the 
##### poor with you, but you will not always have me. 
##### In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it 
##### to prepare me for burial. **Truly, I say to you, wherever** 
##### **this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has**
##### **done will also be told in memory of her.**”
###### - Matthew 26:6-13

Matthew fingers all the disciples, but John 12:1-8 narrows it to Judas Iscariot. Judas kept
the group’s money bag and was skimming from it. On the surface, he was concerned about
charity. Underneath, it was greed. If the other disciples grunted their agreement with
Judas, it may have been because they coveted not the money but the good reputation that
comes from making a big contribution to the temple or to charity.

Decades ago, I composed a worship song about the woman who anointed Jesus. Her
story moved me and challenged me. Are you keeping her memory alive by emulating her
example? Is your love for Jesus extravagant enough for people to insult you for being
wasteful?

## 10b: (Matthew 27-28)

#### **You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant,**
#### **or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey,**
#### **or anything that is your neighbor's.**

In Matthew 27, we see how covetousness gave root to a money laundering scheme
(27:1-10). When Judas returns the blood money for betraying Christ, the chief priests had a
conundrum. That money was accursed, so it could not be added to the temple treasury.
But oh, how they coveted that money! They found a loophole that enabled them to do
something “charitable” with the funds: buy a field to bury foreigners in. Covetousness is
oh, so clever.

The jealousy towards Jesus over performing all those miracles and winning over the
crowds is expressed elsewhere in Scripture, but the fruits – the arrest, trial, and execution
of Jesus – are on full display in these chapters. However, Matthew does not dwell on their
covetousness, but on the Christ’s generosity. He gave his life as a ransom for many.

And what was the fruit? Despite danger, scorn and grief, women cared for his body. A
rich man donated his tomb (27:57-61). Soldiers coveted their lives and money, so they lied
about the body being stolen (28:11-15). Then Jesus gave us a gift so generous, we do not
deserve it.

#### Then Jesus came to them and said, 
##### “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
##### Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, 
##### baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son 
##### and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything 
##### I have commanded you. **And surely I am with you always,** 
##### **to the very end of the age.**”
###### - Matthew 28:18-20, NIV

He gave us the most important job in history and promised to always live up to that
blessed name, Immanuel. God is with us, our eternal life. Why should we covet anything
else?

## Coincidence?

Matthew has many references to the commandments. Couldn’t the preceding pattern
that matches each of the commandments to chapters be a coincidence? If every chapter
mentioned every commandment, it would absolutely be a coincidence. Then you could
walk though each chapter and pick the command you wanted to highlight and construct
any sequence of commands you wanted. However, this is not the case. Murder is a topic in
six chapters and adultery four. The word mother occurs in twelve. Father appears in
twenty-three, but only twelve are in the context of honor or dishonor.

Assume that each imperative may be found in half the chapters (fourteen), which
overstates things in favor of the possibility of the pattern being a sheer coincidence. What
would be the odds be of assembling a complete sequence of imperatives ordered by
chapter if references to each of the fourteen imperatives were sprinkled
randomly among the twenty-eight chapters? The formula for that probability is simple:

**Probability = (14/28)28 = 3.7253 / 1,000,000,000**

The odds that the Law Pattern in Matthew is a random coincidence are less than four in
a billion! It is not illusory. It is real.

## The Law of Christ

Paul may have named the Law of Christ, but now we see that Matthew enumerated every
statute, like Moses with the original tablets of the law. Jesus fulfilled each statute of the
law, which it is useful to summarize. Before that, let’s revisit the association of each
imperative with a member of the Trinity from [Which Ten Commandments](./which-ten-commandments.html).
To the list of fourteen we shall add the corresponding chapters of Matthew.

  - Father (1-2).
  - Father (3-4), Spirit (5-6), Son (7-8).
  - Spirit (9-10), Father (11-12), Son (13-14).
  - Son (15-16), Father (17-18), Spirit (19-20).
  - Father (21-22), Son (23-24), Spirit (25-26).
  - Spirit (27-28).

The question is, if each command has a special affinity to one member of the Trinity in
Exodus, does that association hold up when we look at Matthew? It does! Here is the
evidence. Each imperative goes with two chapters. At least one of each pair matches the
relevant person of the Trinity. Four chapters in all do not match the expected person.

  - **Chapter 6** matches the Father, not the Holy Spirit
  - **Chapter 12** matches the Holy Spirit, not the Father
  - **Chapter 17** matches the Son, not the Father
  - **Chapter 28** matches all members of the Trinity, not the Holy Spirit alone

The deviations from pattern do not look accidental. Chapter 6 mentions the Father nine
times, including Jesus teaching the Lord’s Prayer. Chapter 12 addresses the blasphemy
against the Holy Spirit, possibly the strongest statement in the Bible about the importance
of the Holy Spirit. Chapter 17 shows the Transfiguration of Jesus, which prefigures the
fullness of the glory in which he will one day appear. Lastly, the concluding chapter of
Matthew, chapter 28, holds the central verse in the Bible revealing the Trinity. Thus each
person of the Trinity receives one out-of-place chapter to reveal something special about
him, followed by one chapter that emphasizes their cooperative unity. This is on top of
seventeen instances of the Harvest Pattern described in Peace, a pattern rich in Trinitarian
structure. Matthew is shouting Trinity with so many poetic and rhetorical devices that it
boggles the mind how some continue to dispute this!

We have established that not only do the commandments match the structure of
Matthew but the person of the Trinity inferred as having an affinity for each imperative
also matches Matthew. Thus we can be sure that Jesus’ life and ministry and his
relationships with the other two persons of the Trinity are a complete and complex
incarnation of the law in all its fullness. What does that law look like now?

The Growth and Harvest Patterns are vectors. That means they have a direction, moving
from beginning to end through time. Both conclude with peace. The Law Pattern,
structured as it is by the Trinity and divided into human and divine relationships (love
God and love neighbor), does not at first seem to have a direction. It seems to represent
eternal, static ideas, not a dynamic process. The difficulty is that the commandments do
not constitute a one-dimensional vector. They form a field with two-dimensions. One is
time, the other, space. The unsurprising surprise is that this third pattern also points to
peace.

## As Above, So Below

The fourteen imperative statements may be divided into two levels. The first seven are
about actions and attributes of the upper level, the eternal, heavenly realm. The second
seven are about the lower level, the temporal, earthly realm. Each imperative in the upper
level has a corresponding match in the lower level. The conventional view is that the two
levels divide commands to love God from those to love your neighbor. However, if you
consider that Christ is all and is in all, then all the imperatives are also about something
Jesus is doing for us.

The phrase “as above, so below” and its Latin and Arabic antecedents have unfortunate
occult connections. This phrase also appears in the Bible paraphrase The Message in its
rendering of the Lord’s Prayer. It is used in place of “on earth as it is in heaven”. The
philosophical idea is that all that happens in this world is an outworking of something
happening in Heaven. That is the motion from above to below. In addition, there is a
process in Heaven from beginning to end, concluding in peace. As this process proceeds
in Heaven, the parallel process on earth moves forward towards its conclusion. On earth,
it seems as though all the cause and effect relationships are entirely in our realm. It is our
blindness to what transpires up there that deceives us.

This schematic shows the direction of flow from above to below and start to finish for
the Ten Commandments:

<img src="images/as-above-so-below.png" alt="As above, so below" width="800" height="287"/>

Looking at the horizontal sweep of seven steps, you can see hints of both the Growth
and Harvest Patterns, but the fit is less precise than correspondences found elsewhere in
Scripture. The beginning of the story (God as creator and parents as having children)
makes sense as the preparation or security phase. The end of the story makes sense, with
the seventh day of rest sharing the same spirit as peace and contentment, the opposite of
covetousness. The story behind the middle imperatives is fuzzier. One thing can be said. It
describes a plan for delivering peace to a broken world.

First, let us look at the clearer explanations of the vertical “as above, so below” links
from the previous diagram.

**1 to 5: Creator**. We are to have no other gods because He is our creator, and no one else
can claim that title. Mothers and fathers imitate God by their activities in procreation.
Many people think of the first commandment as the most important. I would put it
second, but only by being combined with the fifth. The two essentials of God’s plan for
peace are a channel for blessing and the blessing itself. The fifth commandment is the
channel of blessing. It is the only commandment that comes with a promise, 
*“that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.”* (Exodus 20:12)

How does the blessing for honoring parents become a channel for infinite blessing
entering into our world? Remember what we discovered in Psalm 19 in the last chapter?
The answer is **adoption**. Here is the chain of events:

  - Jesus honors his Father (God) and his mother (Mary), calling forth God’s blessing for keeping the fifth commandment.
  - Jesus on the cross pays for our sins, performing the work that empowers faith in him to accomplish a person’s **adoption** into God’s family.
  - John said *“But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God…”* (John 1:12) Our faith in Jesus gives us the right to be **adopted** into God’s family.
  - Jesus said, *“For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”* (Matthew 12:49) This enables all believers, having now been **adopted**, to participate in the honor that Jesus bestows upon his parents and to receive that blessing.
  - The blessing is entering into God’s eternal sabbath rest, defined in the fourth commandment.

An important dimension of that channel of grace is that it enables an eternal, heavenly
peace to be poured into a finite, temporal world of time-bound people. This is only
possible because the eternal Word of God took on the nature of a finite human, bridging
the chasm between time and eternity.

All the work of God is essential, no step being superfluous, but the end goal is the most
important: eternal rest and peace in God’s presence. That is why the fourth commandment
is the most important. It channels the grace that is being delivered to the saints.

**2a to 6: Incarnation & Sacrifice**. The direct, negative connection between the
command against making idols and murder is the evidence from pagan rituals.
Cannibalism, human sacrifice and child sacrifice make murder into a religion. Today’s
religion of human sacrifice is the abortion industry, which enables the flourishing of
adultery by hiding its consequences.

The positive side of not making idols is what God did: He begat his Son, Jesus Christ.
We are not to make idols in the form of anything in the heavens above or on the earth
below. The Father, however, caused Jesus to take on the form of sinful man. That means he
resembles the image of something on the earth below, but he was not made by human
hands, so he is not an idol. Also, he is eternally begotten of the Father (John 1:18),
meaning he was never “made”. The incarnation is the Father’s legitimate, sinless solution
to mankind’s need for a God that we can see and relate to on a human level.

The sixth commandment is the opposite of incarnation; murder is the destruction of the
image of God in another person. The positive side of murder is Jesus’ voluntary sacrifice
of his life to pay for our sins and give us his eternal life.

Together these two commands speak of the incarnation and the crucifixion of Jesus.
One speaks of his descent to earth, the other begins his return journey to heaven.

**2b to 7: Worship**. The opposite of worshiping an idol as in the second part of the
second commandment is worshiping the true God. The seventh commandment forbids
adultery, which the Bible uses as a parable for false worship. False worship destroys the
church and harms or ruptures our relationship with God, breaking up our spiritual family.
Literal adultery destroys our earthly families. The two commands are one.

**3 to 8: Faith & Grace**. The third commandment forbids using the name of the Lord in
vain. One way to do this is to pray without faith, asking God for things we don’t believe
he can or will give us. We are told by Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount to ask, seek and
knock and by James to not doubt. The prayer of doubt is vain speech.

A second way to use the name of the Lord in vain is to be a false prophet or teacher.
Such a person says words that are not from God, makes promises that God has not said he
will keep, and arrogates authority to themself that is not rightfully theirs. The evils that
spring from such false prophets are greater than what proceeds from material thieves,
because even the righteous are often caught up in such wickedness.

The eighth commandment against theft would seem not to match the third. Stealing
God’s authority for yourself is worse than stealing money directly. Corrupt religious
leaders are notorious for fleecing the flock for tithes and spending it on their own selfish
desires. False visions have started wars.

The opposite of these two is the Lord’s generosity. We tried to steal his life but he gave
his life willingly. He asked the Father again and again for miracles of healing and
deliverance and countless thousands were blessed.

The Lord did steal something: he bound the strong man and stole back souls in bondage
to Satan.

**4a to 9: Holiness and Truth**. The second and third parts of the sabbath
commandment tell us what to do when it is not the sabbath and what not to do when it is
the sabbath. This first part tells us what to do on the sabbath: keep it holy. What does that
mean? The ninth commandment forbids lying. This gives us a clue about what to do on
the Sabbath: tell the truth to God. It means to talk to him and listen to what he prompts
your heart to do. The ninth plague was of darkness. Jesus is the Light of the World, so
keeping the Sabbath holy means letting the light of Christ as found in the gospel shine
into your soul.

**4b to 10a: Purpose and Place**. Ecclesiastes tackles the challenge of finding purpose in
our work. The second part of the fourth commandment is the command to work six days.
If God commands it, it is not vain and futile.

The first part of the tenth commandment calls on us to not covet our neighbor’s house.
If you combine this with the upper half, that means each person must build their own
house. In Peace, chapter ten of Ecclesiastes was shown to be a parable of how to build a
house, which is more than a building; it is a strong family. That is our temporary abode. If
you trust Jesus, you know that he has promised to build something permanent for his
family of faith:

#### Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God,
#### believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions:
#### if it were not so, I would have told you.
#### I go to prepare a place for you.
#### And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
#### and receive you unto myself;
#### that where I am, there ye may be also.
###### - John 14:1-3, KJV

In Revelation, this place of many mansions is revealed in all its splendor:

#### Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, 
#### for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, 
#### and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, 
#### coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride 
#### adorned for her husband. 
#### And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 
##### “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. 
##### He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, 
##### and God himself will be with them as their God. 
###### - Revelation 21:1-3, ESV

The opposite of covetousness is waiting for the closing date to pass papers on a house
without a mortgage. The closing date is the Day of the Lord. The papers are the heavenly
scroll, unsealed by the Lamb. The house is the heavenly city. The check is drawn on God’s
treasury, Jesus Christ. And there is no quarterly water bill to pay the MWRA, because the
river of life is free.

**4c to 10b: Eternal Rest and Wedding Banquet**. The final part of the sabbath
commandment is to rest on the seventh day. Do we rest alone? No, because God said, “It is
not good for the man to be alone.” Eve was made for Adam to be his bride, but the
Church was made for Christ to be his. We are not to covet our neighbor’s wife or husband
because our heavenly union will far exceed in joy and peace anything that we could find
in an illicit affair.

And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the
Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” (Revelation 19:9)

## Growth along the Lower Level

One reason that the horizontal links between the commandments are fuzzy is that the
pattern makes more sense on the lower level of commands to love our neighbor than the
upper level level related to loving God. Thus we shall first address the seven imperatives of
the fifth through the tenth commandments.

The seven imperatives form a Growth Pattern, but most imperatives match two
consecutive growth phases, not one. This complication was unexpected and made
discovering and verifying the pattern difficult. Thus the commandments overlap each
other, yet still proceed to the same goal.

  - **Security (5)**. The 5th commandment to honor parents identifies parents as the source of a child’s security and matches “a time to be born”.
  - **Ability (5,6)**. Parents (of the fifth commandment) train children to develop their mental and physical abilities. Then the sixth commandment against murder matches “a time to kill”, one of the four times that goes with this growth phase.
  - **Stability (6,7)**. The sixth commandment is against murder, which springs from anger, an emotion teens must master during the stability phase. The seventh commandment is against adultery, which springs from lust and other emotions that must also be mastered.
  - **Amity (7,8)**. Amity is about friendship, romance and marriage. Adultery destroys marriages. The eighth commandment gainst theft concerns unequal partnerships where a selfish friend or lover pursues their own interests exclusively, like a leech or an abuser.
  - **Opportunity (8,9)**. The eighth commandment against theft in this case is usually literal. It can include stealing intangible opportunities from others but most commonly means stealing tangible goods or money. The ninth commandment against lying can mean falsely claiming responsibility for a good idea or accomplishment, blaming a colleague for a mistake or cheating people in a business venture by lying about the quality or quantity of the goods delivered. The Lord hates lying scales.
  - **Community (9,10a)**. Community is built upon open, truthful communication, as
in “a time to be silent” and “a time to speak”. Breaking the ninth commandment
against lying destroys community, as in “a time to tear”. So does the enmity that
springs from a covetous heart. The first part of the tenth commandment forbids
coveting your neighbor’s house. A house can be a building, but it can also represent a
family, clan, church or larger group of people. In that case, coveting means desiring
the power and prestige that another person enjoys in the community.
  - **Loyalty (10a,10b)**. Finally, our chief loyalty should be toward Christ and his
church. The house we should desire is the house of God and the person we should
desire with our whole heart is Jesus. Covetousness in this case is false religion. The
opposite of covetousness is the contentment of “a time for peace”.

The above concordance demonstrates that the second half of the commandments
provide guardrails that foster growth. This is further evidence that the pillars of wisdom,
which conform in greater detail to the Growth Pattern, fit into forms carved from the
foundation of Lady Wisdom’s house, the Law.

## The Upper Story Harvest

Can we replicate our success of matching the lower level of commandments to the
Growth Pattern? The pattern we should expect for the upper level is a Harvest Pattern.
Why expect this? Jesus was called “something greater than Solomon”. Solomon’s Growth
Pattern concerned affairs “under the sun”, which means it must be the inferior “so below”
pattern. If Jesus’ Harvest pattern is greater, it must go with the “as above” upper level.
(Recall that the Seven Pillars are sequenced according to the Harvest pattern, symbolizing
its superiority over the pillars’ internal Growth Patterns.) Here is the concordance between
the first seven imperatives and this pattern:

  - **Preparation (Preamble, 1)**. “I am the Lord your God…”. The defining aspect of preparation is acknowledging that God is your Lord; it is the Fear of the Lord, the heart of the preamble and the first commandment.
  - **Plowing (2a)**. The beginning of the second commandment forbids making idols. This connection is profound. Solomon tells us that the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of feasting and pleasure. We short circuit God’s purpose for us in mourning if we seek an illegitimate way out. The common shortcuts are alcohol, drugs, sex, and the pursuit of wealth. These are our idols, which we make to save us from our sorrow.
  - **Planting (2b)**. The end of the second commandment forbids worshiping idols. That is the rooting in our minds of the false ideas that our idols are teaching us.
  - **Pouring (3)**. The third commandment is about using the name of the Lord in vain. It sounds like speaking, which is verbal and belongs with the planting phase. Instead, the key word is “vain”. Meaninglessness and futility are an affliction of the heart. Vain prayer is faithless prayer. It has no seed so sprouts no shoots. False prophecy and religious manipulation of others is a fruit of pride, another blot upon the heart.
  - **Plucking (4a)**. The first sabbath imperative is to keep the sabbath holy. It is about making your relationship with God a priority. Plucking is God disciplining us to adopt sane priorities by removing the weeds of distraction. The main distraction is our work and the worries that attend it.
  - **Producing (4b)**. The second sabbath imperative is to work. To produce a harvest at the end of the season requires hard work. Laziness is the enemy here.
  - **Peace (4c)**. The final sabbath imperative is to rest on the seventh day. Without question, this is a call to peace.

Now we can see that the Law is an indispensable support for both producing a harvest
and promoting spiritual growth. The commandments show how the spiritual harvest in
the upper level, which yields spiritual treasures, funnels those treasures down to earth to
trigger spiritual and material growth in the world “under the sun”. Jesus said, “But seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”
(Matthew 6:33) He meant it.

## Altogether Now

After examining all these commandments, it should now be clear why the fourth
commandment (and its mirror in the ninth and tenth) is the most important
commandment. It is the goal, the consummation of our faith, the eternal rest delivered
into our temporal world at last and celebrated at the wedding feast. If you look at the forth
commandment closer, you will notice that it is the only command with three imperatives,
and there is one imperative for each member of the Trinity. This commandment shows
that eternal peace consists in living in harmony and communion with all three persons of
the Trinity.

Introduced in Peace and recapped in this book, Ecclesiastes enumerates the types of
prophetic clocks. They are also hidden in the commandments. The preamble speaks of
liberation from Egypt, followed by Ten Commandments to preserve liberty. That points to
the Empire Clock of ten empires, found earlier in Job. The second commandment then
evokes a Generational Clock:

#### You shall not bow down to them or serve them, 
#### for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, 
#### visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children 
#### to the **third and the fourth generation** of those who hate me, 
#### but showing steadfast love to **thousands** of those who love me 
#### and keep my commandments.
###### - Exodus 20:5-6

The two groupings of seven imperatives suggests a Spiritual Clock as well as the sabbath
regulation’s use of seven. Then, the fourth commandment suggests a Celestial Clock, by
reference to the creation of the heavens, which includes the heavenly timepieces:

#### For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, 
#### the sea, and all that is in them, and rested 
#### on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed 
#### the Sabbath day and made it holy.
###### - Exodus 20:11

The numbers three, four, six, and thousand describe salvation history. God works for six
thousand years to prepare for the delivery of eternal peace, which happens in the seventh
millennium. The other division of history is four thousand years from creation to Christ
and three more thousand years (one abbreviated) from Christ to consummation.
(Alternately, it is three thousand years from the creation to King David and another four
thousand years until the unending reign of David’s son, Jesus.)

Taken together, the Ten Commandments describe God’s Trinitarian nature, His plan of
salvation and spiritual growth, how peace shall be communicated from Heaven to Earth,
and how long the process will take. Truly, the Law of Christ is a marvel of compactness
and mystery. It is complete, with no holes in it. Not so our hearts…
