This article draws upon results from several prophetic clocks to show that the Millennial Kingdom of Christ
began in 380 AD and ended in 1380 AD. It argues that during this period, Satan was bound for a thousand years
and then released to "deceive the nations" and gather them for war. The solutions to several interpretative difficulties
that are offered conform to a system called **Fractal Historicism** and defined on this website.

## The First Resurrection

There is no theory of eschatology that can explain Revelation 20 without difficulty. 

<em>
<p>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.</p>

<p>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</p>

<p>And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.</p>

<p>- Revelation 20:1-8</p>
</em>

Some end times theories argue that there will be two physical resurrections for believers, the first at the 
start of the millennium and second after the final battle with Satan. In **Fractal Historicism**, the first resurrection, when many Christian martyrs were raised up to reign with Jesus, was not an event anyone could see on Earth. Christ ruled over the Millennial Kingdom from Heaven through his agents,
the visible church. The resurrected martyrs remained with Christ, wherever he is.

Consider the alternative. Any system that expects a literal thousand-year kingdom that begins with a resurrection
visible on earth has a problem. It is self evident that this first resurrection has not occurred yet. If it 
occurred tomorrow and ushered in Christ's kingdom, then that kingdom would end in 3024 AD. The year 3024 is 
more than 7,000 years after the Creation, which occurred between 4100 and 4000 BC. 
Over the course of church history (and including ancient Jewish philosophers), many theologians have 
expressed the conviction that the world will not exceed 7,000 years of history before the end comes. 
All literal systems that posit a visible first resurrection and literal millennium must therefore allow for 
history to extend beyond 7,000 years. May it be so, but I am not prepared to sacrifice an
idea proposed by people wiser and holier than I.

## To Deceive the Nations

In 2020, I began to tackle the problem of assigning dates for the millennium. The answer did not
come via the avenue one might expect. Instead of studying what God has been up to, the answer came from 
studying what Satan was doing. I worked backwards from the present and then forwards from the Creation to
narrow the timing for these events down.

**Working backwards**. Instead of first figuring out when the millennium began, I worked backwards from
today to find when it ended. It was the writings of Ellis Skolfield that made it clear how important are verses 20:7-8.
*"Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations."* We live in a time when one by one, 
nations that once formally acknowledged Jesus as their Lord have turned away. That means that for many years 
Satan has been deceiving the nations and causing them to renounce their former loyalty. When did this trend begin?
Skolfield proposed a year, but I pushed it farther back in to the past. I initially settled on 1453 AD, when
Constantinople fell, but another line of reasoning made me push it farther back, to 380 AD. Here is
the logic that led me to my first guess of 1453 AD, from "The Final Countdown" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*:

#### When did this great deception begin? 
#### When did Satan begin whispering 
#### “ditch Christianity” in the ears of rulers
#### and revolutionaries?
##### When India gained independence (1947)?
##### After Hiroshima (1945)?
##### During the Bolshevik Revolution (1917)?
##### How about the Mexican Revolution (1911)
##### or Mexico’s earlier adoption of an 
##### anti-clerical constitution in 1857?
##### Maybe further back, with the American
##### constitution (1787) that disestablished
##### religion and the French Revolution (1789)
##### that waged war on the Catholic Church 
##### in that country?

#### If you walk back further in history, you get
#### to the Ottoman conquests, which forced many
#### Christian kingdoms, like Bulgaria, Serbia and 
#### Romania, to renounce Christianity and become
#### Muslim. Tracing this back to its source, 
#### history made a sharp turn in 1453 AD, when
#### Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire and
#### the Byzantine Empire – called also the
#### Eastern Roman Empire – was no more.

#### Was that the year Satan began to deceive the nations?

**Working forwards**. It was mathematics and not Scripture alone that supplied the next clue. 
In this approach, I worked forward from the Creation to discover when Satan was released. 
When I was a child, I loved the puzzle books sold at the grocery store. One of my favorites was a 
book of number sequence puzzles. They gave you part of the series and you had to figure out the rule 
and guess the next numbers in the series. The Bible provided me with such a puzzle.

Almost ten years ago, I tried to find a pattern in history, what I called a "cosmic chiasm" based on the genealogy 
in Matthew. This exploration is related in detail in [Generations Come and Go](./generations-come-and-go.html) 
and [Two Patterns in History](./two-patterns-in-history.html). A result from this was that history might
last 42 generations of 119 or 120 years, excluding the first two of Adam and Methuselah, who lived much longer.
This yielded an approximate time for the end of 2283 AD.

After that, I studied Job for several years. Part of that research yielded an approximate date for the events in
that book in the range 1800-1700 BC. When I turned my attention to Ecclesiastes, I began to develop the 
[Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.html). Insights from the story of the temptation of Jesus in Matthew were
important in developing this pattern. to understand that temptation. I looked for all the places where Satan
tempts people. My initial search found three: Eve, Job, and Jesus (ca 29 AD). Jesus alludes to another: Satan has asked 
to sift Peter like wheat, but that event happened near in time to when Jesus was tempted. Later on, I added
Satan going out to deceive the nations as prophesied in Revelation 20 as representing a fourth tempting by Satan.
Paul then supplies a fifth prophesied example of Satan's temptation in the accounts of the strong delusion: *"Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false."* (2 Thessalonians 2:11)

In *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, in the chapters "Three Appointments with Satan" and "The Final Countdown", 
I worked my way from an approximate number series to a precise one. Here are the initial, imprecise numbers:

  - **4004 BC**: Temptation of Eve (near the Creation according to Bishop Ussher)
  - **1750 BC**: Temptation of Job
  - **29 AD**: Temptation of Jesus
  - **1453 AD**: Satan begins to deceive the nations
  - **2283 AD**: Satan's strong delusion

As a child, I would have given up on this sequence. It is not regular. The intervals between the dates
keep getting less, and there is no obvious rule for how:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>2254, 1778, 1424, 869</p>
</div>

I was no longer a child. I plotted the numbers and fit a curve to them. It was close to a declining
quadratic sequence, in which each difference is the same as the previous difference with a 
constant factor removed. An example of an ascending quadratic sequence would be:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>1, 5, 8, 10, 11</p>
</div>
 
The first change adds 4, the next adds 3, then 2, then 1. Each change is one less than the previous change.
What if I adjusted the dates to force them into a quadratic sequence? The 29 AD date for Jesus' temptation 
is the most accurate one; I shifted it to 30 AD, another accepted year for the event. 
What was the original step size and how should the step size change? 
The closest round number for the first step was 2,250 with a decrease in step size of 450.
This led to the following intervals between events:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>2250 ➛ 1800 ➛ 1350 ➛ 900</p>
</div>

Applying those intervals backwards and forwards from 30 AD yields these years. (We ignore the missing 
year zero to make the dates round numbers. This doesn't matter because the uncertainties in the earlier 
dates exceed one year anyway.)

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>4020 BC, 1770 BC, 30 AD, 1380 AD, 2280 AD</p>
</div>

This shifted the date of the Creation back 16 years, Job back 20 years, and the time of the end 
back three years. Since this bit of estimation I have found solid solutions to chronology problems
to back up this Creation date. This includes dealing with the rounding errors inherent in the Genesis chronology, 
as reported in [Dating the Creation](./dating-the-creation.html).

The largest change was to the time when Satan was unbound and set out to deceive the nations, shifted by 74 years.
It was this analysis that focused my attention on the next question. When was Satan bound?
If he was ubound in 1380, then he must have been bound in 380 AD. What happened in that year?
That was the year that Rome became a Christian empire as a result of Theodosius I's Edict of Thessalonica.
That was the backwards way that I discovered the year when Satan was bound and the Millennial Kingdom began.

## Why expect a pattern of years?

The entire chain of reasoning above flowed from my expectation that God structures history in a regular way
such that the intervals between key events happen at round, predictable intervals. My mathematical bent
predisposed me to look in that direction. That is not the way that most scholars conduct theology.
Numerical elegance does not carry much weight with them. They consider it a trap for fools who lean
on ideas that cannot support weight. What is the point? The point is that I now had a theory about when
important events occurred or will occur. Having a theory, I could test it. Inspiration may spring from
strange impulses, but its source should never be used to rule an idea out. Logic and evidence are the proper tools
for that.

Over the next several years I uncovered over forty [Prophetic Clocks](./prophetic-clocks.html).
This required that I synchronize all the clocks, otherwise the same prophesied event would be assigned to
disjoint eras, producing an temporal inconsistency that would undermine everything. Part of that effort
was expressed in the chapter "Let's Synchronize Our Watches" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
The difficulty with synchronization is the sheer number of combinations involved. If the range of dates
for the Creation is 100 years, for Job another 100 years, for the Unbinding of Satan another 100 years,
then you have a million permutations right there (100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000). Add more clocks
with more uncertainties for additional events and the combinatoric explosion will overwhelm you.
They cannot all be tested. My math skills reduced the problem to a single solution to test.
If a poor guess then the large set of constraints supplied by the collection of clocks could not
all be satisfied at once. Instead, I was able to harmonize all the clocks to assume those key dates,
like 4020 BC for the Creation and 380-1380 AD for Millennial kingdom. Because all the clocks use
ranges of dates for each era, there is a little wiggle room. Some dates could be off by a decade or so
and still mostly work, but no more than twenty years in most cases. In other cases the overlaps
constrain the dates to no more than four years error.

The preceding is how an engineer approaches theology. Beginning with rough estimates, I slowly applied
additional constraints to sharpen the result. When the numbers did not add up, I checked my assumptions
and if necessary changed them. There are many ways to solve some chronology problems; I had to research 
the range of solutions proposed by others and pick ones that worked together without contradiction. 

## Clock by Clock

With the preceding as prolog, it is time to look at several prophetic clocks from my books
and see what they have to say about Satan being bound and about Christ's rule over the nations.
Many of the clocks are introduced in the several articles in this section of the website: [Prophetic Clocks](./prophetic-clocks.html). We will not define those clocks or prove their existence here.
Instead the clock will be named, the passage with the prophecy identified, and the year range that the clock
assigns to that event given.

In progress...
