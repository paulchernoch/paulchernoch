#### **The law of the Lord is perfect**,
##### reviving the soul;
#### the testimony of the Lord is sure,
##### making wise the simple;
###### - Psalm 19:7

## Beginning at the End.

When I began to pour my energies into unraveling the mysteries of the Bible's wisdom, I did not begin with 
the Ten Commandments. I began with Job, detoured through Matthew, then plunged into Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, before
finally settling upon the Psalms and the tablets of Moses. A wiser person than I would have taken a more direct route.
The Law of Moses, and in particular the Ten Commandments, are the foundation of Lady Wisdom's house.
My clever mind reveled in what I perceived to be the subtle, sweet richness of those other springs.
I did not credit Moses with setting before us ideas so elevated that those other books in comparison are mere 
stepping stones up to its heights, puddles besides its sea.

To the modern reader, the metaphorical mazes of the wisdom lore are literary sugarcoating on simple analogies.
The mystery is that the parables tell you exactly what they mean, so directly and purely that the eyes of
our shallow, contorted hearts can't see the sense of them. All the talk of seven pillars, of a house with a 
foundation, of growing crops and harvesting them seems to us mere surface style. The reality is that they precisely
define ideological constructs and their interrelationships. The words reveal patterns and whole books of the Bible
conform to those patterns, realizing and elaborating upon them.

The first article in this section will explain the Law Pattern: [Which Ten Commandments?](./which-ten-commandments.html)

The second article will explore how that pattern is realized in the Gospel of Matthew: [Matthew and the Law of Christ](./matthew-and-the-law-of-christ.html)

## Time and Eternity

The majesty of the Law Pattern is that it serves as a true ideological foundation to Lady Wisdom's House. 
The first tablet of the commandments matches the Harvest Pattern of Jesus, point point for point. 
The second tablet matches the Growth Pattern of Solomon. Had I not discovered those two patterns first, 
I never would have decoded the commandments. Thus the Ten Commandments comprise all the richness and power
of both of the patterns that govern the pillars of wisdom.

**Time**. In Matthew 12:42, it says *"something greater than Solomon is here."* 
That was the clue that the Harvest Pattern of Jesus is greater than the Growth Pattern of Solomon. 
Solomon's pattern governs life "under the sun". It defines the normal course of life for people, nations like Israel, 
the Church, and all of human civilization. Solomon's pattern is about *time*. 

**Eternity**. On the other hand, Jesus' pattern is about spiritual growth and the acquisition
of spiritual treasures. Jesus' pattern is about *eternity*. How marvelous then was my realization that the 
Harvest Pattern matches the commandments to love God, the things above. Contrarily, the Growth Pattern matches 
the commandments to love your neighbor, the things below. Together, we have commandments and patterns for both time 
and eternity.

**Ten or Fourteen?**. The Ten Commandments are used as a template in many places in the Bible. 
Sometimes they divide things into ten parts, such as the ten verses of Hannah's prayer in 1 Samuel 
(see the article [Hannah's Song](./hannah-s-song.html) ) or the ten chapters that comprise 1 & 2 Timothy. 
Sometimes the commandments are divided into fourteen parts, for the reasons given in the article
[Which Ten Commandments?](./which-ten-commandments.html). The premier example of that is Matthew, where
each pair of chapters matches one of the fourteen affirmative statements of the commandments.

## The Decalogue

**I**

#### 3 “You shall have no other gods before me.

**II**

#### 4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, 
#### or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, 
#### or that is in the earth beneath, 
#### or that is in the water under the earth. 
#### 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, 
#### for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, 
#### visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the 
#### children to the third and the fourth generation 
#### of those who hate me, 
#### 6 but showing steadfast love to thousands 
#### of those who love me and keep my commandments.

**III**

#### 7 “You shall not take the name of the Lord 
#### your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold 
#### him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

**IV**

#### 8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
#### 9 Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, 
#### 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. 
#### On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, 
#### or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, 
#### or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. 
#### 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, 
#### the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. 
#### Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

**V**

#### 12 “Honor your father and your mother, 
#### that your days may be long in the land 
#### that the Lord your God is giving you.

**VI**

#### 13 “You shall not murder.

**VII**

#### 14 “You shall not commit adultery.

**VIII**

#### 15 “You shall not steal.

**IX**

#### 16 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

**X**

#### 17 “You shall not covet your neighbor's house; 
#### you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, 
#### or his male servant, or his female servant, 
#### or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.”

Those are the commandments. They are not dry rules that restrict. They are not static, like scalars in mathematics. 
They are dynamic liberating vectors that point us in a new direction. These words guide us towards the 
eternal sabbath rest. For a complete exposition on how they are a beautiful and liberating
guide towards the savior, read my book, *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. 
The following articles are two of the chapters from that book:

  - [Which Ten Commandments?](./which-ten-commandments.html)
  - [Matthew and the Law of Christ](./matthew-and-the-law-of-christ.html)

In them, you will learn that buried in the Ten Commandments is a clue to one of the most revolutionary
truths of Christianity: the incarnation.
