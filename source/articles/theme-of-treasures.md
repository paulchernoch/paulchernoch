title: The Theme of Treasure in the Pillars of Wisdom
quote: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, <br/> where neither moth nor rust destroys <br/> and where thieves do not break in and steal. <br/> - Matthew 6:20
---
## Treasures

Early in my Christian walk it was the desire to know
what are the treasures in Heaven that animated my search
for wisdom. My craving for such treasure was kindled by
Jesus’ words in the Sermon on the Mount. When I began to
uncover them, I learned that treasuring the things God
treasures is synonymous with worship. Doing the opposite
is idolatry. That is treasuring the impermanent or the
unclean. This connection to worship makes more sense
now that I know that the Spirit of Understanding is the
spirit of worship. This tension between true and false
worship expressed as true and false treasure is made
repeatedly in the books that constitute the Pillars of
Wisdom.

## Treasures in Psalms

The first stop on this treasure hunt is Psalm 115.

#### Their idols are **silver** and **gold**,
#### the work of human hands.
##### \[A\] They have mouths, but do not speak;
##### \[B\] eyes, but do not see.
##### \[C\] They have ears, but do not hear;
##### \[D\] noses, but do not smell.
##### \[E\] They have hands, but do not feel;
##### \[F\] feet, but do not walk;
##### \[G\] and they do not make a sound in their throat.
#### Those who make them become like them;
##### so do all who trust in them.
######  - Psalm 115:4-8

Like Ecclesiastes 12 and the words of the prophets, this
psalm lists for us the ill effects of idolatry. The idols cannot
do things like see and hear and so idol worshipers become
like the things they worship! Sometimes it is the virtues that
are compared to silver and gold, but not here. If you
consider that leprosy can cause loss of smell (and even loss
of the nose itself ), then the above lists conditions all of
which Jesus healed: the mute, the blind, the deaf, lepers,
those with withered hands and the lame. Since speaking is
twice disabled, it is likely that one is a physical disability
while the other is a mental one.

The LORD appears twelve times in this Psalm. Thus, this
key Psalm about treasure also points to Psalms as the Book
about "The LORD” or accepting the Spirit of Lordship. To
demonstrate our respect of His authority, we are exhorted
to trust in the LORD, fear the LORD, extol or bless the
LORD and praise the Lord.

## Treasures in Job

Job is the pillar associated with the
spirit of Wisdom as well as the suffering of plowing. In
chapter 28, a hymn about searching for wisdom compares
that quest to the human search for precious metals and
stones. The numbering of the treasures here is added for clarity.

#### “Surely there is a mine for **(1) silver**,
##### and a place for **(2) gold** that they refine.
#### **(3) Iron** is taken out of the earth,
##### and **(4) copper** is smelted from the ore.
#### Man puts an end to darkness
##### and searches out to the farthest limit
###### the ore in gloom and deep darkness.
#### He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives;
##### they are forgotten by travelers;
#### they hang in the air, far away from mankind;
##### they swing to and fro.
#### As for the earth, out of it comes bread,
##### but underneath it is turned up as by fire.
#### Its stones are the place of **(5) sapphires** (or *lapis lazuli*),
##### and it has **(6) dust of gold**.
#### “That path no bird of prey knows,
##### and the falcon's eye has not seen it.
#### The proud beasts have not trodden it;
##### the lion has not passed over it.
#### “Man puts his hand to the flinty rock
##### and overturns mountains by the roots.
#### He cuts out channels in the rocks,
##### and his eye sees **(7) every precious thing**.
###### - Job 28:1-10

Seven precious materials are named (with the last being
the generic “every precious thing”). Gold appears twice.
The first mention of gold is in position two, which is Job’s
position in the harvest pattern and matches the Spirit of
Wisdom. Gold refined points to suffering. The second
mention of gold is in position six and matches the Spirit of
Knowledge. Together gold matches wisdom and
knowledge. This is another instance where the treasures of
Colossians are singled out, for 
*“in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”*.

The treasures can dazzle us so much that we miss other
details. Interspersed between references to treasures are
other images that are given in a special order: light, rope,
food, the bird of prey, the falcon, proud beasts, and the
lion. If you look closely, these images are references to Job
39-41 given in reverse order.

  - Man “puts an end to darkness” by bringing light, which matches chapter 41 where Leviathan snorts fire and has glowing eyes
  - People “hang in the air” and “sway to and fro” by using a rope, which matches chapter 41, where a rope leash is suggested as useless to bind Leviathan
  - “the earth, out of it comes bread” matches the food offered as tribute in chapter 40 to Behemoth
  - The bird of prey matches the eagle of chapter 39
  - The falcon matches the hawk of chapter 39
  - The proud beasts match chapter 39’s menagerie of donkey, ostrich and horse
  - Lastly, the lion appears in chapter 38

In *Job Rises*, I observed that Elihu’s speech formed a
chiasm with God’s, with the key themes given in opposite
orders. This chiasm between Job’s speech and God’s I
overlooked. It is not the themes that are reversed but
something else. It is the journey. In God’s speech, the
Almighty descends from heaven to the sky with its birds, to
the land with its beasts, then to the battlefield to face
Behemoth, who guards the gateway to the grave. Finally,
God descends to Hell to face Leviathan and bring judgment
and justice. That is God’s journey. It is not ours.

In his poem in Job 28, Job describes our journey, and it
is glorious. All those years spent dissecting Job and I missed
this! Job is describing the rapture of the church!

  - What light shall “put an end to darkness”? It is the glory of Christ’s coming, for he is the Way and the Truth and the Light.
  - Who are the people who “hang in the air”? They are the blessed Christians who never die, who rise to meet the Lord in the air at the blowing of the last trumpet on the day he returns.
  - What is the bread that comes out of the earth? Those are the righteous dead who will be resurrected into glorious bodies to join the others in the air.
  - What is “it” that resides “underneath \[and\] is turned up as by fire” (ESV)? The NIV might be more helpful here, as it says, “transformed below as by fire”. If it said “destroyed” I would think of the judgment of Hell. Instead, this makes me think of our being purged of sin following death when “we shall be changed” as Paul says in 1 Corinthians. Whether this change is instantaneous, as many Protestants believe, or after a lengthy stay in Purgatory, as Catholics and some other do, I cannot say.
  - What of the bird of prey and the falcon? That reference is less certain, but it seems to indicate that the raptured and resurrected will fly with Christ to the battlefield to witness his great victory over the proud beasts of the earth.
  - Who then is the lion? Satan is called by Peter a prowling lion, seeking people to devour. Jesus is called the Lion of Judah. These two lions shall meet and only one walk away. That signifies Christ’s final victory and capture of the earth from Satan and his followers.

Job 28 says that no one knows the way to where wisdom
may be found. Then it goes and illustrates the day when the
church finds the way and follows it to heaven. The way is Jesus.

## Treasures in Proverbs

Comparing wisdom to treasure is a central theme in Proverbs. It is particularly strong in
Proverbs 3:13-18 and Proverbs 8:10-19. The latter passage
repeats an emphasis we have seen before, also with seven
treasures.

#### Take my instruction instead of **silver**,
#### and knowledge rather than **choice gold**,
#### for wisdom is better than **jewels**,
#### and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
#### ...
#### **Riches** and honor are with me,
#### enduring **wealth** and righteousness.
#### My fruit is better than **gold, even fine gold**,
#### and my yield than choice **silver**.
###### - Proverbs 8:10-11,18-19

Again, we see gold in second and sixth position. Now it
is “choice gold” and “gold, even fine gold”. Once more,
Jesus’ possession of wisdom (the second spirit) and
knowledge (the sixth) is trumpeted, just as it was in Job,
Song of Songs and Colossians. Note also that the sixth
treasure comparison speaks of “My fruit”, signifying the
harvest, the sixth phase of the Harvest Pattern.

## Treasures in Song of Songs

Dividing the book into seven parts, each with four consecutive speeches, allows us
to match the seven spirits of God. Each section also has one
or more references to treasure.

**1:1. 1:11. 2:2. 5:1. 5:10. 6:11. 8:8.**

1. Ornaments and a string of jewels are in 1:10. In 1:4-5, references to King and Solomon indicate **Lordship**.
2. In SS 1:11, earrings of gold with silver studs indicate the spirit of **Wisdom**. Gold emphasizes this spirit, because it is one of the two treasures associated with Jesus in Colossians 2. Myrrh in 1:13 symbolizes Christ’s suffering in this plowing phase.
3. In SS 2:3, "sit in his shade" has the Bride putting herself in a receptive position, "standing under". The reference to firstfruits (a Jewish religious festival) connects the passage to worship, hence the spirit of **Understanding**. This section includes verses 3:6,10, which have silver but also gold, frankincense and myrrh, the items brought by the three wise men when they went to worship baby Jesus.
4. In SS 5:1-9 there is going back and forth about being patient about love. SHE is offering her friends **Counsel**. Myrrh appears three times in this section, in 5:1,5. How sweet the aroma of wise counsel!
5. In 5:10-6:10, SHE describes the appearance of her Beloved. Giving only the precious items, there are seven:

   1. finest **gold**
   2. myrrh
   3. rods of **gold**
   4. jewels (or topaz)
   5. polished ivory
   6. sapphires (or lapis lazuli)
   7. alabaster (or marble) pillars on bases of **gold**

The Bride says of these qualities that "they overwhelm
me". SHE is overawed by his **Might**. The analogies to parts
of her lover’s body given in this passage are eight, but the
hair, eyes and cheeks are not matched to precious things,
but instead doves, milk, spices, and the like. The
description goes from head to toe, in a linear sequence.
The mention of raven, dove, and streams of water suggests
the flood of Noah, a time when God displayed his might.

Given other arrangements of treasures where gold was
used to mark the second and sixth of a series, this passage
baffled me. Also, the count of body parts and treasures
differ. Which details were significant in defining the
number and structure? Only when I reflected on another
Bible prophecy with a head of gold did I find a possible
interpretation. In Daniel is found a dream of a statue with a
head of gold, shoulders and chest of silver, belly and thighs
of bronze, and legs of iron. Each metal stood for a different
empire. The progression from most to least precious
showed a steady decline in quality from the first empire to
the last. Not so in this picture. The head is gold. The arms
are gold. The legs are gold. And the chest? Sapphire or lapis
lazuli, symbolizing God’s Law, his Word. The lover is
precious from top to bottom and inside his jeweled chest,
his heart is filled with God’s Word. So, what does this all
mean? Jesus, the eternal Word, is our treasure and he also
treasures within his own heart the same eternal Word.

6. In the sixth section, 6:11-8:7, we see jewels, ivory, crowns & wealth. The intimate details show that the lovers know each other. Thus, this speaks of **Knowledge**. In reflecting upon this section, I pondered whether there was some common feature to set off the second and six sections and so highlight wisdom and knowledge. There is. It is the crown. Song of Songs 3:11 uses the word crown three times. This reminds me of the old hymn “Crown him with many crowns”. Then this section has these marvelous words:

#### Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel.
##### Your hair is like royal tapestry;
###### the king is held captive by its tresses.
###### - Song of Songs 7:5

This is the Lover speaking of his Bride. What knowledge
can be greater than the Lord telling us, his church, that we
shall reign with him!

7. In 8:8 to the end, the talk is about who is entitled to
how much of the produce from the vineyard. SHE promises
not the required rent from her vineyard to her lover and
king, but her entire income (apart from the worker's share).
This demonstrates total surrender and reverence, thus 
**The Fear of the Lord**.

As a final word on Song of Songs, I offer God my
apologies. Of all the books in the Bible, I have read this
book the least often and until this year, studied it the least.
Many people ask why it is even in the Bible. It stands apart.
As a parable and prophecy, it is the most subtle of all
works, defying the efforts of many people to find any
spiritual value besides, “You should wait to get married.” I
know enough now to conclude that I barely know anything
about its message, but at least I now know that it has a
message.

## Treasures in Ecclesiastes

In the pages of this book, the Teacher is not content to merely decorate his poetry
with metaphors to treasures. He fairly shouts the
connection between each treasure and the seven spirits of
Wisdom.

1. Ecclesiastes 1:1-2:11. Here Solomon demonstrates that he is in control. He is the lord of his kingdom, to the point of boasting about owning slaves, a treasure of which no one should boast. A further indication is given in this verse: *“I also gathered for myself **silver** and **gold** and the **treasure** of **kings** and provinces.”* (Ecclesiastes 2:8a) Consequently, this first section is animated by the spirit of **Lordship**.
2. Ecclesiastes 2:12-2:21. Solomon next turns to the spirit of Wisdom.

#### “So I turned to consider **wisdom** and madness and folly…
#### So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair 
#### over all the toil of my labors under the sun, 
#### because sometimes a person who has toiled
#### with **wisdom** and **knowledge** and skill must leave 
#### **everything** to be enjoyed by someone who did not 
#### toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
###### - (2:12,20-21)

The first treasure mentioned here is implicit. It is the
“everything” that Solomon laments he must leave to
those who did not toil for it. Everything includes all his
material treasures. If only he esteemed the second
treasure more! Wisdom and knowledge are joined again,
marking the treasures of the second and sixth spirits as
special.

3. Ecclesiastes 2:22-4:6. This section is graced by the poem about the times. The words that follow that poem are about the worshipful heart, hence are animated by the spirit of **Understanding**.

#### For to the one who pleases him God has given **wisdom** 
#### and **knowledge** and joy.
###### - Ecclesiastes 2:26a
#### ...
#### He has made everything beautiful in its time. 
#### Also, he has put **eternity into man's heart**,
#### yet so that he cannot find out what God
#### has done from the beginning to the end.
#### ...
#### I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; 
#### nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it.
#### God has done it, so that **people fear before him**. 
#### That which is, already has been; 
#### that which is to be, already has been; 
#### and God seeks what has been driven away.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:11,14-15

Note that verse 2:26 speaks of “wisdom and
knowledge”. Once again, we see the pairing from
Colossians, the two treasures most closely identified
with Jesus. I would consider it pure joy to leave such
treasure to those who follow me. Verse 2:26 continues
with words about the *“business of gathering and collecting”*. 
This focuses our attention not on the
treasures themselves, but on the labor and skill that
goes into acquiring them. The section ends in 4:5 by
addressing the poison fermented within our craving for
treasure: envy.

4. Ecclesiastes 4:7-5:20. A summary of the fourth section would be, “Don't go it alone.” Seeing the word “advice” in verse 4:13 tells us that this is surely the spirit of **Counsel**.

#### Two are better than one... 
##### a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
###### - Ecclesiastes 4:9-12

#### Better was a poor and wise youth 
#### than an old and foolish king 
#### who no longer knew how to take **advice**. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 4:13

Solomon continues by giving advice about wealth and
riches in 5:8-20. They are about not embracing
(worshiping) money. His only positive statement about
lasting treasure is to clarify its source: God’s grace, not
our human effort.

#### Everyone also to whom God has given 
#### **wealth and possessions** and power to enjoy them, 
#### and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—
#### this is the gift of God.
###### (5:19)

5. Ecclesiastes 6:1-8:14. The fifth section (in 6:1-2) describes the paradox of possessing but not enjoying one’s possessions. The trials deepen in chapter 7:2,4, which announces the House of Mourning. Which is worse, not enjoying what we have or losing it altogether and being forced to mourn the loss?

If we suffer loss, it may because someone stronger than
us took what belongs to us, as with Job whose
possessions were carried off by bands of thieves. That
cause is addressed in this section from multiple angles.

#### Whatever has come to be has already been named, 
#### and it is known what man is, and that he is 
#### not able to dispute with one stronger than he. 
###### (6:10)
#### ...
#### For the protection of wisdom is like the 
#### protection of money, and the advantage of knowledge 
#### is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
###### (7:12)
#### ...
#### Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than 
#### ten rulers who are in a city.
###### (7:19)
#### ...
#### No man has power to retain the spirit, 
#### or power over the day of death.
###### (8:8)

What do all the above verses have in common? They are
about our need for the spirit of **Might**.

6. Ecclesiastes 8:15-9:8. In this section we come to the
spirit of **Knowledge**.

#### For the living know that they will die, 
##### but the dead **know** nothing, 
#### and they have no more **reward**, 
##### for the memory of them is forgotten.
###### (9:5)
#### ...
#### Whatever your hand finds to do, 
##### do it with your might,
#### for there is no work or thought or 
##### **knowledge** or **wisdom** in Sheol, 
###### to which you are going.
###### (9:10)

The pairing of wisdom and knowledge shows here as it
did in two previous sections of Ecclesiastes. Christ’s
greatest wisdom was that he knew he would die and yet
obtain a great reward, an inestimable treasure. Though
Jesus had what we lack – the power to escape death – he
knew that his death would set the world free from death
and – contrary to Solomon’s words – the memory of this
would never be forgotten. On another point Solomon
was only partly correct. There WAS no thought or
knowledge or wisdom in Sheol. That ended the day that
Christ descended into the grave and brough God’s
thoughts with him. He brought the knowledge of how to
save sinners and the wisdom to rejoice when anyone
else would mourn, for it is written:

#### “and let us run with endurance the race that is 
#### set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and
#### perfecter of our faith, **who for the joy that**
#### **was set before him endured the cross**, 
#### despising the shame, and is seated at the 
#### right hand of the throne of God.” 
###### - Hebrews 12:1-2 ESV

7. Ecclesiastes 9:9-12:14. These words speak of the end,
of when we die. Concluding as it does with the dictum,
“Fear God and keep his commandments”, this section
belongs to the spirit of **the Fear of the Lord**. Solomon’s
words drip with irony when he speaks about the
magical power of mankind’s greatest treasure: money.

#### “Bread is made for laughter, 
##### and wine gladdens life, 
###### and **money** answers everything.” 
###### (10:19)

What we treasure and what God treasures are poles
apart. God does not mourn the loss of money or its
equivalents. He shows His valuation in the last chapter:

#### “before the **silver** cord is snapped,
##### or the **golden** bowl is broken…” 
###### (12:6)

The silver that is silver and the gold that is gold is the life
of His children. In Song of Songs, the Lover is compared
to gold. According to the Teacher, in such terms does
our Creator also think of us.

If you look for a progression in Ecclesiastes, a change in
how Solomon regards material wealth, you will find it.
He first possesses it, then fears losing it, then discovers
he lacks the grace to enjoy it or strength to hold onto it.
In the end, two things become more precious to him
than money: human life and time.

## Treasures in Matthew

Jesus’ words in the Gospel of
Matthew were the impetus for my entire search for the
spiritual treasures. To discover the importance of the
metaphor of treasure in Matthew, I counted words like
gold, silver, money, talents, treasure, frankincense, myrrh,
riches, coin, denarius and pearl and put them in a
histogram. Then I appraised the strength and length of
passages that deal with wealth, anxiety, and goals of the
heart to find places where the importance of treasure was
underestimated by mere word counts. After that, I
summarized the counts by the harvest pattern and growth
pattern phases.

To interpret the results, we must decide whether the
growth pattern or the harvest pattern is dominant. This
raises the question of how to weigh the two patterns in
each of the seven pillars.

  - In *Psalms*, the overall structure is unclear. This book (*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*) has restricted itself to critical subsets. The historical psalms encase a growth pattern but their larger structure is the harvest. Other Psalms, like Psalm 23, are solely patterned after the harvest.
  - In *Job*, the growth pattern only appears in the latter twenty-eight chapters. The whole of the book is governed by the harvest pattern.
  - In *Proverbs*, **Song of Songs**, and **Ecclesiastes** – all written by Solomon – the growth pattern is the dominant pattern structuring each book.
  - *Matthew* is chaptered according to the growth pattern, yet contains at least seventeen instances of the harvest pattern, making that its major one.
  - *Revelation* is subtle. The order in which I discovered the patterns in Revelation may not be decisive, but it informs my assessment. First, I spotted the seven thunders, then was able to split the book by the thunders into a harvest pattern. Only after that pattern was clear did the growth pattern come into focus. Conversely, after those discoveries, I noted that the seven signs in the Gospel of John form a chiasm with Revelation. The structure they reveal matches the growth pattern clearly but the harvest less distinctly. Taken altogether, the themes of growth and harvest are blended so well, I cannot choose a dominant one. Revelation describes the end of time, the completion of all growth and the final harvest.

(NOTE: When I wrote *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I discovered and disclosed much more of the structure of Psalms.)

From the above, it seems that three pillars emphasize
the harvest, three growth, and one blends them seamlessly.
Matthew, however, has the clearest focus, so to the harvest
pattern we turn. By this standard, two phases of the harvest
pattern deal with treasures more than the others: the
second (plowing) and sixth (producing). This matches the
other books, which pointed to the second and sixth spirits
of God, Wisdom and Knowledge. These link to the two
comings of Christ, as suffering servant and as conquering
Lord of the Harvest.

How decisive is the analysis? The sixth section has as
many mentions of treasure words (twenty-seven) as the rest
of the gospel! And the second section holds the Sermon on
the Mount, where all who search for spiritual treasure find
their first clue, to “lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven”.
Even so, every section has at least one mention of treasure,
and none are insignificant.

1. The gifts of the Magi are an act of worship that respects the lordship of Jesus Christ.
2. Christ’s temptation in the wilderness shows that material wealth and power is not the animating force in his heart. Then the Sermon on the Mount begins with the Beatitudes, where the poor in spirit and those who mourn are promised something better than riches. Jesus hits his stride by proposing to conquer anxiety not with riches, but with faith. We rightly call the heart of this message “The Golden Rule”, a gem among his teachings. The key thing to note is that all references to riches in this section concern people who don’t have them, just like Job. The poor, mournful and anxious, who fear for food, clothes and shelter, are told how to build a strong house and fill it with good things.
3. When Jesus prepared his disciples to go on their first missionary journey, he told them to leave seven treasures behind:

#### “Do not get any
##### (1) gold or
##### (2) silver or
##### (3) copper to take with you in your belts –
##### (4) no bag for the journey or
##### (5) extra shirt or
##### (6) sandals or a
##### (7) staff,
#### for the worker is worth his keep.
###### - Matthew 10:9-10

The fact that the number of things to leave behind is
seven signifies total dependence upon God’s provision,
though assigning each item a spiritual meaning is
currently beyond me. Jesus is at his best as a teacher,
providing a succinct message for his disciples to share.
Their obedience shows they possess understanding,
insomuch as they are “standing under” Jesus in
obedience to his teachings and authority.

4. **Pouring and the Spirit of Counsel**. After the second and sixth sections, this one has the most references to treasure. The heart attitude of what people treasure is in focus. Jesus says in 12:11-14 that people are more important than sheep (possessions). He speaks in 12:29 of the binding of the strong man so that you can plunder his possessions. He says in 12:34-35 that, *“out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good person out of his good **treasure** brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil **treasure** brings forth evil.”* The deceitfulness of riches is then associated with one of the unfruitful soils in 13:22. Next, in 13:44-46, Jesus uses the parables of the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great price to show the lengths people will go to in pursuit of their heart’s desire. With the parable of the net speaking of the final judgment, Jesus ties all of this to the **counsel** of the prophets, which is a warning to turn away from evil. However, in Matthew 13:53-58, many people reject Jesus’ teachings. Conspicuously, they acknowledge his wisdom (the planting phase) and his mighty works (the pruning phase) but reject him because of unbelief (the watering phase). They reject his counsel. Jesus in 13:52 “\[brought\] out of his **treasure** what is new and what is old.” The old was okay; they could not accept the new. This section ends with a dark sentence: *“And he did not do many **mighty** works there, because of their unbelief.”* (Matthew 13:58) The key word is “mighty”, because the spirit of Might awaits the next section.
5. **Plucking and the Spirit of Might**. This section has two parables concerning treasure, the search for a lost sheep and the parable of the unforgiving servant. If being locked up in prison until you pay your debts is not a picture of God exercising his **might** in pursuit of discipline, nothing is.
6. **Producing and the Spirit of Knowledge**. In ten stories drawn from Matthew 19-25, whether parables, woes, or other forms, Jesus addresses our use and misuse of treasure. The spirit of Knowledge gets down to the implementation details of life, so these stories address many facets of how our attitude toward money and possessions corrupts our judgment.

  - **Rich young ruler**. Material treasure becomes spiritual
treasure when we give it to the poor. It is better to lack
money than to lack generosity.
  - **Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard**. How much is my
labor worth?
  - **Cleansing the Temple**. Prayer is of greater value than the
coin of the money changers.
  - **Parable of the Murderous Tenants**. The tenants valued
their plot of land and its crops more than the life of the
master and his son.
  - **Paying taxes to Caesar**. In our minds there is a conflict
between our financial obligations to God and to country.
We can use what we view as an insoluble problem as an
excuse to neglect one or the other duty. Jesus can lead us
to the proper resolution of this tension.
  - **A Woe concerning oaths**. Oaths to God involving money
were viewed as more important than other types of
oaths. “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, If anyone
swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears
by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.”
(Matthew 23:16 ESV) That means that money was viewed
as more important, too.
  - **The Faithful and Wise Servant**. Wicked servants mistreat
those put under their charge. Faithful servants show
mercy and fairness in how they manage God’s people
and liberally provide food and other resources to sustain
them. Merciful stewardship is more to be prized than the
privileges of leadership.
  - **Parable of the Ten Virgins**. The five foolish virgins are
urged to rush to the merchants to purchase oil but do not
make it back to the wedding in time. Their money – their
material treasure – cannot gain them admittance to the
wedding celebration. It seems that the real treasure was
time, and theirs ran out.
  - **Parable of the Talents**. For excuses, the unprofitable servant cited fear and charged the master with unfairness. Thus, he lacked two more treasures: courage and faith.
  - **Prophecy of the Sheep and Goats**. In the final tale, people are judged on whether they use their treasure to help the poor, the sick, the oppressed, and the prisoners. Mercy is the final treasure to be lauded here. We show that we possess that mercy when we make our neighbors our treasures, thus fulfilling the Golden Rule.

Giving, working, praying, religious vows, loyalty,
authority, stewardship, preparedness, mercy…
money touches on every aspect of our religion.
These stories tie Matthew to the other pillars. For
example, the Rich Young Ruler could have gotten the
same advice from Proverbs: 

#### “Whoever gives to the poor will not want, 
#### but he who hides his eyes will get  many a curse.” 
###### - Proverbs 28:27 (ESV) 

As for making wise oaths, the Scribes and Pharisees could have
benefitted from Ecclesiastes 5. Don’t forget the
foolish virgins, either. They should have imitated the
industriousness of the “daughters of Jerusalem” who
helped prepare the palanquin and other wedding
decorations in Song of Songs. Lastly, any modern
unprofitable servants can read Revelation to see the
glorious reward in store for all who believe. Our
master is not fair – he is generous, giving us more
than we ask for or can imagine.

7. There are only three treasures in this final section: the temple silver, the money paid to the tomb guards, and one other. What was Judas’ treasure? Thirty pieces of silver for a betrayal. What did that same silver become to the temple officials after Judas discarded it? Their greed made them experts at money laundering, converting blood money into real estate and treachery into charity. The guards took a bribe to lie that they were outsmarted by body snatchers. Disloyalty, greed, jealousy, power and deception. Tarnished silver and hush money are humanity’s treasure. The real treasure was the body and blood of Jesus, our souls’ ransom. Sadly, the spirit of the Fear of the Lord is not found in these acts. Judas became afraid, but instead of repenting, took his own life. The Jewish leaders were afraid, but of Rome, not the Father, so they surrendered Caesar’s rival. The soldiers were afraid of being executed by men, not cast into Hell by God. Jesus, however, filled with holy fear, lay down his life in obedience. This sacrifice by a suffering servant finds its closest analog among all the Pillars of Wisdom in the sufferings of Job and the account of Leviathan in Job 41. That connection binds the second pillar to the sixth more than all the whispers found in patterns previously described involving gold or crowns.

## Treasures in Revelation

We come now to the last of the clues that identify the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
Revelation is too full of treasure to perform a complete
analysis here. We shall focus on the sections with the least,
most, and last mentions of treasure. As before, Revelation
is divided into pieces by thunder.

  - **The Least**: Section 2, Chapters 6 & 7, spirit of Wisdom. Like the other pillars of wisdom, the second section stands apart as special, having the fewest mentions of treasure. Recall how Job corresponds to the second spirit of Wisdom and represents plowing, mourning, persecution and loss. Also recall how the second section of Matthew speaks to the poor in spirit, the mournful, the persecuted and people anxious for food and clothes. This section shares the same spirit. Chapter seven has no references to treasure; it has the Great Tribulation. Chapter six has only three references to treasure, but in each case negates that treasure by lamenting its scarcity. *“And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, 'A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!' ”* (Revelation 6:6 ESV) This chapter speaks of scarcity, not plenty. It also speaks of persecution (6:9-11). The only mention of the rich is to describe how they go into hiding (in 6:15).
  - **The Most**: Section 6, Chapters 16-18, spirit of Knowledge. Knowledge is about knowing the details of how complex systems function and are maintained. Here the economic system is in view:

#### lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone, 
#### and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, 
#### and scarlet, and all thyne wood, and every vessel of ivory, 
#### and every vessel of most precious wood, 
#### and brass, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon, 
#### and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, 
#### and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, 
#### and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, 
#### and of **bodies and souls of men**.
###### - Revelation 18:12-13, YLT

A wise person said in Proverbs something that ties
together the second and sixth spirits:

#### Two things I ask of you;
##### deny them not to me before I die:
#### Remove far from me falsehood and lying;
##### give me neither poverty nor riches;
#### feed me with the food that is needful for me,
##### lest I be full and deny you and say, 
###### “Who is the LORD?”
#### or lest I be poor and steal and 
##### profane the name of my God.
###### - Proverbs 30:7-9

The spirit of wisdom is what we need to master poverty.

The spirit of knowledge is what we need to master riches – and not be mastered by them.

Jesus mastered poverty during his first coming. When he returns, he shall distribute 
all the wealth of heaven to his children.

  - **The Last**: Section 7, Chapter 19-22, spirit of the Fear of the Lord. The last section of Revelation has the second greatest number of references to treasure, though none are found in chapter twenty (about judgment) or twenty-two. The beauty of the new Jerusalem is described in terms of precious gems and gold, but it is the treasure-free chapter twenty-two that has the best word of all:

#### The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” 
#### And let the one who hears say,
##### “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come;
##### and let the one who wishes take the
##### **free gift of the water of life**. 
###### - Revelation 22:17, NIV

Free! The water of life is free! That is the end to all
treasure, because all will be treasured, all free, and all
need for comparison, for calculation, for acquiring,
saving, and spending will be gone.

Isaiah put it best.

#### O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted,
##### behold, I will set your stones in antimony,
###### and lay your foundations with sapphires.
#### I will make your pinnacles of agate,
##### your gates of carbuncles,
###### and all your wall of precious stones.
#### All your children shall be taught by the LORD,
##### and great shall be the peace of your children.
###### - Isaiah 54:11-13 ESV

The prophet lists seven treasures, but the two most
precious are the two he lists last: children and peace. With
all that we have seen, it is finally possible to identify the
seven treasures in Job 28, if we draw on several of the
pillars, thus tying them all together:

  - **Silver** is *the Lord*, because Jesus our Lord was sold for thirty pieces of silver in Matthew.
  - **Gold** is *Wisdom*, because the Lover in Song of Songs is described as gold, from head to toe, and Daniel in his prophecies links the head of gold to wisdom. *“How much better to get wisdom than gold!”* (Proverbs 16:16a)
  - **Iron** is *Understanding*, because it was the Iron empire, Rome, that God placed under the control of his church. And in Proverbs we have this gem: “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.” (Proverbs 27:17 ESV) Many times in Revelation, Psalms and other places is iron associated with forced submission, because the wicked refuse the voluntary worship that flows from understanding.
  - **Copper** is *Counsel*, because of Solomon’s bronze pillars, Jachin and Boaz, and his authorship of Proverbs, which names and numbers the Pillars of Wisdom. (Bronze is copper alloyed with tin.)
  - **Lapis Lazuli** is *Might*, because it was Issachar's stone, and Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds (Genesis 49:14). Also, the Ten Commandments may have been carved in Lapis Lazuli, God's mighty throne rests upon lapis lazuli, and Isaiah 54:11-13 says that the foundations of the new Jerusalem will be made from this stone. The chest is also the part of the body associated with strength with all its muscles and the heart that beats there, and in Song of Songs, the chest of the Lover is described as decorated with Lapis Lazuli.
  - **Gold dust** is *Knowledge*, for Job 22:22-25 and Isaiah 54 treasure 6 compare gold to being “taught by the Lord”. As for Proverbs, it says, *“Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.”* (Proverbs 8:10 ESV)
  - **All its treasures / Every precious treasure**. This must match *the Fear of the Lord*, because the end of Revelation has the most glorious listing of treasure and Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms and all the prophets agree that the Fear of the Lord is the primary cause that leads to every good thing.
