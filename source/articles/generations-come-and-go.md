## The Mystery of Matthew's Genealogy

In Ecclesiastes 1:4, Solomon declared, *“Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever."*
Those words compelled me to write this book. This is why.

About seven years ago, while reading Matthew’s
genealogy of Jesus, the idea showed up. I researched it,
took notes, and proved to myself that the pattern I hoped
to see in history was there. That pattern also had forty-two
generations, but was not tightly tethered to Scripture like
the frameworks for Psalm 119, Ecclesiastes and Job
presented in this book. What stopped me from pursuing
this idea further? Nowhere in the Bible could I see a hint
that one should find such a structure hiding in its pages.

As I studied Job, I found many prophecies. On a lark, I
slotted those prophecies into my old forty-two generation
time grid and was shocked. Job had something to say to
every generation from the creation on up to Jesus, plus a
few for the end times. The ordering of the smaller set of
prophesies I spotted then was not chronological. Thus I
viewed Job as expressing a comprehensive view of history,
but not an ordered, tightly structured one.

The results of that research became Appendix B in Job
Rises. The generations in that appendix are 120 years long,
not 119. The start and end years for each generation vary by
a few decades compared to this book. Besides that, I still
stand behind most observations made in that appendix.
The only exceptions are a few events that moved forward
or backward one generation, muddying the pattern. The
new structure sharpens things.

This idea did not jump fully formed into my imagination,
but grew and metamorphosed into its current form
following years of study and tinkering. Part of the challenge
is that religions have different ways of looking at time.
Some see time as cyclical, others as linear. The Bible shows
both, as Ecclesiastes 1 attests. Cycles within cycles lead to a
single linear progression at the largest scale. Because of this
scaling issue, it is hard to know at which level any given
pattern sits. We cannot see the end from the beginning.

Thus we had Daniel’s and John’s empires, each lasting
longer than the one before it. We had seven church ages,
each longer than the previous. This stretching enables God
to fit in additional smaller cycles as time goes on. It appears
to widen out to infinity, permitting our earthly existence to
go on forever. Is there a feature of history that unveils the
opposite? Is there a correspondence between the earliest
days and our current time that points to the end? Or after
this forty-two generations will there be forty-two more?

No, the end draws near. Yes, there is in history a grand
correspondence. A mirror. A chiasm. But to discover that
correspondence, we need need to detect the characteristic
frequency behind God’s dealings with man. When God’s
voice thunders, like a singer in the heavenly choir, we need
to match His pitch.

<span id="2"/>
## Autocorrelation

During college, I worked briefly at General Electric.
There I learned a signal processing technique called pitch
detection. Some people speak at a higher pitch than others.
Deduce the pitch and you can distinguish one speaker from
another, or track their emotional state. One autocorrelation
algorithm for doing this – average squared mean difference
– is simple.

**First**, pick a pitch (a frequency). This is your guess of the
amount of time “t” between amplitude peaks of a recorded
voice. A higher pitch has a shorter time period.

**Second**, run through a section of the recording and pick
out two amplitude values, one at time “x” and a second at
time “x + t”.

**Third**, subtract amplitude values and square the difference.

**Fourth**, add that square difference to a running total.

**Fifth**, advance to the next audio sample. Continue until you
process all amplitude pairs.

**Sixth**, record the sum for “t”.

**Seventh**, pick another “t” and repeat.

**Eighth**, after you run through many values of “t”, choose
the value of “t” with the smallest sum. The inverse of that
period is your pitch.

What does autocorrelation have to do with acts of
creation? *First*, it offers an approach different from ones
employed earlier in this book. When studying Psalm 119, we
correlated images from each stanza of the psalm to history.
When studying Job, we compared images from each
chapter to historical events. With autocorrelation, we
compare history to history. It is easier: no tricky parables
and metaphors to decipher. It is also harder: the Bible
focuses our attention, whereas history is vast in the
number of events available for comparison.

*Second*, if history consists in ever lengthening cycles of
events, you will not find a characteristic frequency; there
will be no definite pitch. Applying an autocorrelation
algorithm to history can help us decide one way or the
other. If there is a strong signal, it will identify its
frequency. That will tell you how long each generation
should be.

Using this analogy, what are the amplitude differences?
They would be comparisons between historical events. If
the key events in two generations match well, the
“distance” between them is small. For example, if one
generation saw the beginning of slavery and another its
abolition, or both generations had a big plague, that would
be a match.

<span id="3"/>
## A Cosmic Chiasm

If history is cyclic, the autocorrelation function described
earlier would detect that. If instead we apply our matches
by mirroring across a central time, we can detect if there is
a single pattern that spans all of time, a linear pattern. We
can detect a *chiasm*. Recall that in a *chiasm*, the first section
matches the last, the second matches the next to last, and
so forth.

Why a chiasm? Because that is what we see in Matthew:

#### Thus there were **fourteen** generations in all from Abraham to David,
#### **fourteen** from David to the exile to Babylon, 
#### and **fourteen** from the exile to the Messiah.
###### - Matthew 1:17, NIV

#### A. Abraham
##### B. David
##### B’. Jeconiah (sent into exile)
#### A’. Jesus

**How do Jesus and Abraham match**? Abraham offered his
son as a sacrifice, but God told him to stop; He would
provide the sacrifice, and presently a ram showed up. Jesus
would be that lamb.

**How do David and Jeconiah match**? David began life full
of faith, but later committed adultery and murder. Jeconiah
began life weak in faith. God pronounced a curse on him
that he would die young and have no descendants sit on the
throne. He went into exile, but there he humbled himself.
The enemy king treated him kindly and he lived long. One
of his grandchildren, Zerubbabel, became not king, but
governor of Judea. God showed clemency. At the end of
Jeconiah’s line comes Joseph, adoptive father of Jesus.

The peculiar thing about the genealogy is that it repeats
the number fourteen three times. Three times fourteen is
forty-two, but in the direct line from Abraham to Jesus,
only forty-one are named! Should we count Jeconiah twice
because he was a changed man? Should we count Mary,
because Joseph was only Jesus’ legal father, by adoption,
not his biological father? Or should we count Jesus twice,
coming once as a mortal in humility (like Jeconiah in exile),
but a second time as a conquering king, like David?

I chose the latter. That gives us forty names of sinful men
needing a savior from Abraham to Joseph, followed by one
savior who battled sin and death on the cross, followed by a
conqueror bringing peace to his subjects at the end of time.
The first forty-one happen inside normal time, while the
last ushers in eternity. (Alternately, the Church is his
spiritual offspring, his 42nd generation.)

Why is that breakdown important? Some chiasms have a
dual center where two parts match, while others have a
single center, a part with no match. If our chiasm has an
odd number of parts (forty-one), it will have a unique
center. If an even number of parts (forty-two), then a dual
center. Job Rises argued for a chiasm with forty-one parts.
Does that decision also need to be revisited?

<span id="4"/>
## The Optimal Solution

How do we know we have chosen the optimal starting
years for our generations, the values that give the truest
interpretation? Four things could ruin our chiasm:

  - We placed the wrong events and generation at the center. This will completely break the symmetry.
  - We chose the wrong number of generations (steps) for the chiasm. This will cause the timeline to stop short of Christ’s return or overshoot it.
  - We chose the wrong length for a generation. Ditto for the consequences.
  - God didn’t plan history to follow that pattern.

When I began this research, Matthew 1 was all I had to go
on for counting the number of generations. Genesis 6:3
(where God says he will shorten the maximum human
lifespan to 120 years) was all I had for picking the length of
generations. After drawing on Ecclesiastes, Psalm 119 and
Revelation 2-3 for additional evidence, I improved the time
grid by shifting the date of creation and changing the
period to 119 years. Could we do better?

Let’s assume a few things as given and see what happens
if we vary the length of each generation.

  - Assume our chronology is correct, so that generation 3 starts in 2361 BC (after the flood). This insulates us from errors in the date for creation.
  - Assume the number of generations is correct (42), with the first two occurring before 2361 BC and the 42nd happening after the “end of times”. That leaves thirty-nine to play with.
  - Assume history won’t exceed 7,000 years.
  - Assume Jesus was born “in the end times”, meaning no earlier than the midpoint of history.
  - Assume that Jesus has not yet come again!

## Generation Count: In your Dreams

Assuming what you hope to prove is dirty pool, or in
Latin, *petitio principii*. Instead of begging the question, I
will beg for your indulgence. Earlier chapters offered a
numerological defense of forty-two plus a reference to
Matthew’s genealogy which is not obviously prophetic.
There is one methodical prophecy that can be adduced as
support, where forty-two elements are explicitly identified
with years. In this prophecy, as with Matthew, the forty-two
symbols are divided in three groups. The matter is life and
death and touches on slavery and freedom, increasing its
relevance. The prophecy is Pharaoh’s dream.

#### Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, 
##### “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
##### when out of the river there came up seven cows, 
##### fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 
##### After them, seven other cows came up—scrawny and 
##### very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows
##### in all the land of Egypt. The lean, ugly cows 
##### ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 
##### But even after they ate them, no one could tell 
##### that they had done so; they looked just as ugly
##### as before. Then I woke up.
##### “In my dream I saw seven heads of grain, 
##### full and good, growing on a single stalk. 
##### After them, seven other heads sprouted—
##### withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
##### The thin heads of grain swallowed up the 
##### seven good heads. I told this to the magicians,
##### but none of them could explain it to me.”
###### - Genesis 41:17-24

In the narrative, the dreams are described once as they
happened, then told to the magicians without being
repeated in the text, then told in detail to Joseph, who
recaps them with the interpretation. Thus the two dreams
are repeated in the text three times. (Each telling is
different. Joseph summarizes, including fewer details than
the initial account, whereas when Pharaoh speaks, he
includes more details than the initial account. We analyze
Pharaoh’s account.)

#### Then Joseph said to Pharaoh,
##### “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. 
##### God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do."
###### - Genesis 41:25#

In the space of minutes, Joseph rises from prison inmate
to second in charge of all Egypt, in charge of storing up
grain from an expected seven years of plenty to provide for
the nation during the famine to follow. During those years
Joseph had two sons and named one Ephraim, 
*“because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.”* (Genesis 41:52)

The circumstances connect tightly to our harvest pattern:
harvest, famine, and the blessing of a wife and children.
Seven sleek and fat cows are named three times, as are
seven gaunt and sickly cows, another three times, for forty-
two cows in all. In Joseph’s interpretation, each cow stands
for one year, with seven years of plenty followed by seven
years of want.

Could those cows (and the parallel heads of grain) also
stand for forty-two generations? Instead of one event
repeated three times, could they speak of one long
sequence? Does anything about the phrasing add additional
details beyond just a number to connect cows and sheaves
with the history of the world?

Before we tackle that question, let’s ask another. Is this
singular calculation of counting cows a convincing way to
get to forty-two? A closer look shows that the number
appears throughout Joseph’s story by reference to its prime
factors of two, three and seven **(42 = 2 x 3 x 7)**.

Joseph interprets dreams on three occasions, in Genesis
chapters 37, 40 and 41. Each time, there are two dreams.
The first time, they are Joseph’s dreams, the second time,
the dreams of the cupbearer and baker to Pharaoh, and the
third time, of Pharaoh himself. This sequence of dreams
shows a progression. In all of them you see the number
two: two dreams. In the second pair of dreams, the number
three appears: one servant will be restored (the cupbearer)
and the other executed (the baker) in three days’ time.
Three also is a factor in the third set of dreams: they are
repeated three times and have other features related to
three which we will see shortly. Finally, the third pair of
dreams adds the number seven, for the seven years of
plenty and seven years of famine.

The first pair of dreams alienates Joseph from his
brothers, when he prophesies that they will bow down to
him. The second set helps the cupbearer, but the man
forgets Joseph, who sees no immediate benefit and remains
in prison. Only with the complete set of two, three and
seven in Pharaoh’s dreams do we see Joseph’s fortunes turn
around.

The details of Pharaoh’s dreams contribute to the idea
that forty-two is important. The healthy cows are “fat and
sleek”: two adjectives are used. When Pharaoh describes
the sickly cows to Joseph he uses three adjectives: “scrawny
and very ugly and lean”. Then there is the number of each
type of cow: seven.

This counting of adjectives would seem a stretch, until
you compare it to the second dream, about the heads of
grain. Again, when Pharaoh describes them to Joseph, the
healthy grain is called “full and good”, while the unhealthy
grain is “withered and thin and scorched by the east wind”.
Both cows and grain are described first with two and then
with three adjectives for the good and bad respectively.

If the two is God the Son, then this is the mercy of good
blessings up front. Three is the judgment of God that waits
until the mercy has been exhausted. Finally, seven is the
wisdom of the Holy Spirit that combines the mercy and
judgment into a plan that can save the people through the
famine.

Now let’s look at history to see if we have more than
numerical symbolism to stand on. The first inclination is to
see if history had seven bright generations followed by
seven dark ones, repeated thrice. Oh dear: history doesn’t
look that way at all! It is the other way around. Bad
generations are followed by good.

  - 1-7 (4020-1766 BC) – Fall, Flood, Babel, Sodom & Gomorrah, Job
  - 8-14 (1766-933 BC) – **Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon**
  - 15-21 (933-100 BC) – Civil war, Assyria, Babylonian Exile, Four Beasts
  - 22-28 (100 BC-733 AD) – **Jesus, Paul, Constantine, Battle of Tours**
  - 29-35 (733-1566 AD) – Schism, Black Plague, Fall of Constantinople
  - 36-42 (1566 AD - ?) – **Great Awakening, World Missions, Abolition**

The bolded events indicate that the high points in God’s
plan to redeem the world occur in the second, fourth and
sixth groupings of seven generations. Why is this inverted
from the progression in the dreams? Egypt was a beast.
When times are good for beasts, they are bad for God’s
people. The first seven generations culminated in Egypt, a
powerful and pagan beast. The third seven saw five more
beasts arise: Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome
overran the Holy Land. Then the fifth seven during the
Dark Ages produced new empires, like the Islamic
Caliphates and the Mongols.

Joseph lived at the beginning of the eighth generation, at
the head of a good “week” of generations that culminated
in the dedication of the temple in Jerusalem and the reigns
of David and Solomon. In the fourth “week”, Jesus lived
and died and rose again and the church arose to conquer
the Roman Empire. Then in the current “week”, following
the Protestant Reformation, the church spread the gospel
to the ends of the earth, abolished slavery and made its
mark.

If you take it all in, the pattern fits. History has
progressed in six stages, alternating between good times for
tyranny (the years of plentiful harvests) and good times for
freedom, the times of suffering. Egypt used its grain surplus
to subjugate the starving, who sold all they had and became
slaves just to live. However, those who have the faith of Job
prosper more from suffering than from plenty. During the
years of famine, when Joseph saw his chance to get revenge
on his treacherous brothers, his heart changed and he
forgave them instead. In the same way, Job forgave his
persecutors and Jesus forgave the whole world.

What does this mean for our day? The church will suffer,
the church will be purified, and the church will overcome.
We live in a time of sick cows and shriveled grain, the true
condition of the hearts of all who do not know God. We
must believe that God’s storehouse of love is full or else we
will never be able to meet such desperate need.

Thus we have good justification for thinking that forty-
two is the number of generations in God’s eternal plan.
However, recall that Solomon’s clock started ticking during
his life. Should not the starting point of some of Joseph’s
prophesies likewise be anchored when he lived? He was
born near the beginning of a favorable week, near the start
of the eighth generation. He had his early dreams at age
seventeen, which would make it ca 1733 BC.

It is believed that Joseph was thirty years old when he
interpreted Pharaoh’s dream and became vizier of Egypt,
ca 1720 BC. Our peculiar prophetic end date of 2280 AD
falls exactly 4000 years from this date. That is forty
centuries and forty is associated with suffering. Also,
Joseph was reunited with his father after the second year of
famine passed, at the age of forty. Lastly, when Jacob died,
they spent forty days embalming him, according to
Egyptian practice. These numbers will drive you mad trying
to decipher them!

What happens if you count forty centuries from the
Creation? According to Bishop Ussher, Christ was born
exactly 4,000 years from the Creation. In the revised
chronology used in this book, Christ was born 4,000 years
after another event. Adam and Eve were created with no
genetic defects, so it is likely that Cain and Abel were born
one and two years after the Creation, respectively. When
do people have the most trouble with their emotions? As
teenagers. Thus it is likely that Cain slew Abel when he was
sixteen, putting that sacrifice exactly 4,000 years before
Jesus was born.

So we have a type of Christ’s sacrifice (Abel’s death)
falling 4,000 years before Christ’s birth and another type of
savior, Joseph, becoming a type of savior 4,000 years
before the end of the era in 2280 AD. Thus we have
symmetric events placed forty centuries from the
beginning and the end of history.

We have the same thing with generations. At the end of
forty generations we will begin the time of war, then reach
the time of peace. Counting backwards from eternity, after
forty generations elapse, the forty-first generation has war
(the flood) followed in the forty-second by peace (Eden).
Counting back forty generations from 2280 AD, you reach
Noah. Recall that the rain at the beginning of the flood
lasted forty days and forty nights, and forty also popped up
in the story of the raven that Noah sent out from the ark to
see if it was safe to exit. Noah then sent out a dove three
times, with seven days between each attempt.

Thus the story of Noah begins the definition of important
numbers related to time: seven, forty, one hundred twenty,
and one hundred nineteen (as explained in an earlier
chapter). Since Noah’s new life after the flood began after
the first two generations ended, adding forty gives forty-
two.

Returning to Joseph, it is not surprising that multiple
significant numbers spring from his life: forty-two for the
elements of the dreams versus forty years old when he was
reunited with his father, forty days for embalming Jacob,
and forty centuries remaining until the end of the era in
2280 AD.

One last observation ties together both forty-two and one
hundred nineteen. It springs from Joseph’s dreams.

#### Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers,
#### they hated him all the more. He said to them, 
##### “Listen to this dream I had:
##### We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field
##### when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, 
##### while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down
##### to it.”
#### His brothers said to him,
##### “Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?”
#### And they hated him all the more because of his dream a
#### nd what he had said.
#### Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers.
##### “Listen,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time
##### the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down 
##### to me.”
#### When he told his father as well as his brothers, 
#### his father rebuked him and said,
##### “What is this dream you had? **Will your mother and I**
##### and your brothers actually come and bow down to 
##### the ground before you?”
#### His brothers were jealous of him, but his father
#### kept the matter in mind.
###### - Genesis 37:5-11, NIV

When do you think Joseph’s brothers first bowed down to
him in fulfillment of his childhood dream? In Genesis
chapter forty-two! In two other chapters they bow to him
again. Yet Jacob was right! He and Joseph’s mother Rachel
never bowed down to Joseph. Regarding Rachel, she died
before the family reunion. Regarding Jacob, we have the
touching scene where he blesses his grandchildren:

#### Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, 
#### and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons
#### close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
#### Israel said to Joseph,
##### “I never expected to see your face again, and now
##### God has allowed me to see your children too.”
#### Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and
#### bowed down with his face to the ground.
###### - Genesis 48:10-12, NIV

It is Joseph who finally learned humility and respect and
bowed down to his father! But if Jacob and Rachel did not
bow, who are the sun and the moon? And if they are not
the sun and moon of Joseph’s second dream, might the
eleven stars be something besides his brothers?

In the story of Creation, in Ecclesiastes, and in many
other prophecies, what are the sun, moon and stars? They
represent time. The interpretation is not certain, but here
is a possible association. Jewish scholars argue about how
long Joseph was in prison, with common views being ten or
eleven years. Thus it is plausible that the time of the sun
was Joseph’s first year serving Potiphar, when he had the
favor of his master. Then the second year was spoiled by
the moon, Potiphar’s wife, who lusted after him and
slandered him into prison. After that came eleven years in
prison until he was freed. Those years bowed down to him
because though they seemed to harm him, they positioned
him for a great destiny. Alternately, you could reverse the
years. There were eleven years from Joseph’s dreams until
the dreams of the cupbearer and baker, then two more
years until Pharaoh’s dreams.

Two other numbers from this story are significant. He
was sold into slavery in Egypt at age seventeen and Jacob
began his sojourn into Egypt with seventy people
(according to the count in Genesis 46:27). One way to factor
seventy is: 70 = 7 x 10. If you take these numbers as
bookends, you have 17, 7 and 10. Amazing! **119 = 17 x 7**. 
The length of our characteristic generation appears.

Do we have any warrant to multiply 17 by 7? What
happens if we multiply 17 x 70? Taking Joseph’s 17th
birthday of 1733 BC as -1733:

**-1733 + (17 x 70) = -543 => 543 BC**

The Babylonian captivity ended in 537 BC and Cyrus’s
edict permitting the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild
was broadcast in 539 BC. The error bars for our dates for
events in Joseph’s life exceed four years, so this agreement
is good. The timing of Joseph’s dream (when he began
Israel’s exile in Egypt), his age and the number of men
entering exile in Egypt with Jacob combine to form a
prophecy of when the next exile would end. Furthermore,
that prophecy uses a unit related to the generational
scheme, the generation length (119) and an accurate count
of generations (10).

Why should we accept that there is a prophecy of the
later Babylonian captivity when the earlier Egyptian
captivity was just about to begin? It is because the dreams
come in pairs that look alike but aren’t. The cupbearer was
saved but the baker was impaled. Joseph’s first dream was
about his brothers, but his second dream was not about his
dominating his family; it was about sovereignty over time.
Which brings us to the third pair. Pharaoh’s dreams were
both about the coming famine, and both predicted seven
years of plenty and poverty, but they were directed at
different peoples. The dream about grain concerned Egypt,
who was growing the grain, but the dream about cattle was
about the children of Israel (aka Jacob). The story makes a
special point about describing the Hebrew people as
herdsmen and the Egyptians as being disgusted by such
people (Genesis 46:34). The famine would affect both and
bring them together for a time.

So after all these dreams, we are primed to expect a
double meaning when we get to the final supernatural
communication in Genesis:

#### And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said,
##### **“Jacob! Jacob!”**
##### “Here I am,” he replied.
##### “I am God, the God of your father,” he said. 
##### “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will 
##### make you into a great nation there. I will go
##### down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you
##### back again. And Joseph’s own hand will close your eyes.”
###### - Genesis 46:2-4, NIV

God reassured Jacob that it was safe to enter Egypt, for
He would safely bring his descendants back out of Egypt.
Did you notice how God called Jacob’s name twice? Only
seven times in Scripture does God address a person by
calling their name twice and it always indicates a significant
change in identity and responsibility. (The others are
Abraham, Moses, Samuel, Martha, Peter, and Saul.) That is
our clue that this is a two-fold message. God would bring
His people out of captivity a second time.

With the matter of the number of generations settled, we
can move on to additional support for the generation
length of 119 years.

<span id="6"/>
## Generation length

Simple arithmetic shows that if generations are 112 years
long, the “end of times” would have fallen in 2007. We are
still here and Christ has not yet returned; that is too short.

More arithmetic shows us that if generations last 137
years, history will exceed 7,000 years. That is too long.

Further calculations show that for Jesus to be born on or
after the midpoint of history, the length must be less than
128 years. This leaves us with a range for generation lengths
from 113 to 127 years.

My initial choice for analysis was 120 years, which
exhibited a strong pattern. When I repeated it for 119 years,
the pattern was stronger. With autocorrelation, if you are
near the optimal “pitch”, movement toward the optimum
will improve the metric, while movement away from it will
worsen the metric. From this we can conclude that the
correct value is in the range 113 to 119 years.

If you took the center point of history as a given and had
your generations go backwards and forwards from that,
then changing the length of generations would not affect
the quality of the matches due to symmetry, but it would
throw off the estimate for the “end of history”. However,
our generations are anchored by the end of the flood. Each
year added to the generation length shifts the midpoint of
history by 39/2 = 19.5 years. Moving the midpoint has a
strong effect on the autocorrelation. You lose an extra one
sixth (19.5/119) of all matches for each additional year
difference between your estimate of generation length and
the true length. Given that 119 and 120 yield good results,
this rules out 113 to 115 years. Thus the viable range is 116 to
119 years.

Based on concordance with the other prophetic clocks,
119 seems the best choice. However, repeating the analysis
for 118 years would be fruitful. I leave that as an exercise for
the reader.

<span id="7"/>
## The Midpoint of History

Having settled on 119 year long generations, what does
that yield as the center point of history? It depends on
whether we choose a chiasm with forty-one or forty-two
steps. Which of those two possible center points yields the
best pairs of matching historical events? Which tells a
better story?

**Forty-one steps**. For this many steps, the center
generation of history falls between 219 and 100 BC, during
the time between the testaments. The center of that
generation was 160 BC, five years after the cleansing and
rededication of the temple in 165 BC (necessitated by its
desecration by Antiochus IV in 167 BC). That event is
commemorated as Hanukkah.

Lest the Samaritans (rebellious descendants of the tribes
of the Northern Kingdom of Israel) think their religion
vindicated, they suffered a similar fate. In 125 BC, John
Hyrcanus destroyed the Samaritan temple on Mount
Gerazim. Fifteen years later, his sons destroyed its
replacement.

This was the lowest point in the history of the world. No
new prophets had spoken for about 250 years (since the
death of Malachi). The messiah would not come for another
165 years. The world was dark indeed, with only a few
guttering candles on a menorah holding back eternal night.

**Forty-two steps**. For this count, the center of history
falls at the boundary between the 21st and 22nd
generations, in 100 BC, the year of Julius Caesar’s birth.
Antipater, father of Herod the Great, rescued Caesar in
Alexandria, thereby gaining Rome’s favor. Antipater rebuilt
the walls of Jerusalem that had been destroyed by the
Roman general Pompey earlier in this generation. Then his
son, Herod the Great, became king of Judaea and built the
second temple in Jerusalem.

The book of 2 Maccabees was written near the year 100
BC. Some Christians (such as the Roman Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox Churches) accept it as canonical, while
most Protestants do not. This book is remarkable because it
contains in chapter 7 one of the earliest direct and
unambiguous expressions of faith in a physical bodily
resurrection. According to Henry Morris of ICR, only three
religions believe in a bodily resurrection: Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.

Meanwhile, in 97 BC, Rome passed a law outlawing
human sacrifice. This put them in a pickle. The Romans
believed they were successful because they pleased the
gods, but some of those gods required human sacrifice to
be placated. Therefore they created a special category of
“ritual killing” that they supposed met with their gods’
approval but was not human sacrifice. The distinction
shows how deceitful is the human heart. And the Romans
considered themselves superior to other peoples because
of this!

Combine these events from the last century BC, and you
have a new king of Judaea, a rebuilt wall in Jerusalem, a
new temple, a prohibition against human sacrifice, a
recognition that sometimes a person has to die to placate
God, and a faith in the resurrection from the dead. But who
would be such an acceptable sacrifice that this resurrection
could be purchased? King Herod and the Caesars were no
paragons of virtue. Who could be the righteous king that
would set the world right? That would be the man born
near the end of this 22nd generation: Jesus Christ.

## Choose your Ending

Some authors write interactive books where the reader
makes a few key decisions and chooses their own ending.
We have two midpoints: one dark and one light. Which
story is God intending to tell? (Hint: I think He already
chose the ending.)

For the *dark* midpoint, Matthew’s genealogy carries us
via overlapping generations from Abraham to the savior, a
“short” period of time. That span of forty-two generations
is short to show that **God is abounding in love**. God
wanted to send a savior as fast as possible. This new
pattern of forty-two longer, scarcely overlapping
generations is long to show that **God is slow to anger**. It
runs from Adam to the second coming, to the judgment
day. God wanted to give humanity as much time as possible
to repent. The two genealogies – one real and one
conceptual – tell two halves of one story.

For the *bright* midpoint, it is all about love. The short
genealogy from Abraham to Jesus is about how long it took
to prepare a savior for Israel. The long genealogy from
Adam to the Second coming is about how long it will take to
take the Gospel message to the world. Judgment is
unavoidable and present in both stories, but judgment is
not the goal. Finding lost sheep and carrying them home is
the goal. The tale ends with a banquet in heaven, not a
billet in hell.

The Appendix in *Job Rises* settled on the dark midpoint
and a forty-one generation, single-centered chiasm. Why?
Several prominent connections between generations only
appear if you structure things so. This time around I
repeated the analysis for a forty-two generation chiasm.
This produced other striking connections that only appear
when you structure history that way. Arrrrgh! How do you
decide?

I reflected on Job, reread the seven seals of Revelation
(with fresh insights to be covered in a few chapters) and
chose love.

That opened my mind to see a second pattern. In
Matthew’s genealogy, out of forty-one names, he focused
on just four: Abraham (#1), David (#14), Jehoiachin (#28),
and Jesus (#41 and #42, since he is coming again). In my
forty-one generation pattern, generations one and forty-
one match and generations fourteen and twenty-eight
match. As it turns out, generations seven and thirty-five
also matched well. Those are the main matches that go
away if you switch to a forty-two generation pattern.

Those pairs of generations form a seven-part spiritual
clock. If we accept two patterns for history, a forty-two
generation chiasm and this seven-part pattern, we can tell
two stories, not one.

Let’s tell those stories.
