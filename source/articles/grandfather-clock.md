title: A Grand Father Clock & a Silver Cord
---
This article originally appeared as the chapter "A Grand Father Clock & a Silver Cord" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
It describes a prophetic celestial clock hidden in the pages of Ecclesiastes.
This clock not only identifies key developments in the history of Western Civilization, it assigns them to the correct century.

## Before the Silver Cord is Severed

The Apostle Paul pronounced one of the greatest
pare same message can produce the
opposite response, depending on who hears it.

#### For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among 
#### those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
#### To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, 
#### an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task?
###### - 2 Corinthians 2:15-16, NIV

During the past year I sniffed the pleasant aroma in
Ecclesiastes as God’s plan opened up to me. He is
shepherding His church to full maturity and peace, to a
happily ever after. That is not how everyone sees it; it is not
how I used to see it. Like a fractal built from many copies of
the same pattern repeated at larger and larger scales, the
times of Ecclesiastes 3 tell another story. They tell the story
of a world that is perishing. They spread an aroma of death.

Ah, those verses we long to avoid! When I thought this
book was complete, I stepped back to see if I missed
anything important in Ecclesiastes. I saw my omission.
Short shrift was given to the first half of chapter 12. Those
lines poetically tick off the failing of our faculties and the
wearing out of our bodies, one organ at a time.

#### Remember him—before **the silver cord is severed**,
##### and the golden bowl is broken;
#### before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
##### and the wheel broken at the well,
#### and the dust returns to the ground it came from,
##### and the spirit returns to God who gave it. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:6-7, NIV

Scholars agree on the meaning of many of the analogies,
but the silver cord tantalizes. Is it the spinal cord? That
would mean numbness, spasms, uncontrolled pain and
ultimately paralysis. Is it the cord tied around the neck of
the bride and groom at an ancient wedding ceremony, but
buried when one spouse dies? Ecclesiastes 4:12 did speak of
the threefold cord not easily broken. However, the one that
resonates with me is the invisible thread tethering soul to
body, an image I used in one of my novels. When it is cut,
our time is up.

## A Tripartite Life

In “Rightly Dividing the Words”, the Grand Index looked
at every occurrence of the phrase “under the sun”. Then it
was claimed that the phrase divided the book into
intelligible pieces and exposed the structure. However, the
last use of that phrase is in the fifth verse of chapter ten!
Using that phrase as sole guide only works if you only want
to follow a person from birth to maturity. The teacher
doesn’t stop. He marches us all the way to the grave.

What is the larger structure? It is not so tidy as twenty-
eight times of equal length. From experience and from
chapters ten though twelve, a solution arises. Life is divided
in three sections:

  - *Ascending Years* (birth to maturity, in twenty-eight times, up to age 49)
  - *Productive Years* (age 50-61)
  - *Declining Years* (62+)

Chapter ten is all about work, promotions, hiring
subordinates, and dealing with your boss and prominent
rich people. That captures our productive years nicely as
we rise in status in our careers. Chapter eleven moves on to
managing investments, a preoccupation of people nearing
retirement. It then judges the results of those years like a
P&L statement. Finally, chapter twelve confronts old age,
senility, failing health and death. Life divides into three
parts: growth, work, and decline.

The twenty-eight times of Solomon’s Sundial have been
well substantiated and are clearly delineated with the
phrase “under the sun”. We shall see that the final years are
also well marked. The latter part of chapter eleven and the
bulk of chapter twelve are divided in three by the word
“remember”. It is a time for looking back, reflecting, and
preparing one’s heart for the end. That leaves the middle
section, chapter ten. Dividing that into coherent pieces
challenged me for days.

Why set the age ranges as above? Partly because that is as
I found them in the text. One could hope for nice round
numbers, but those age ranges are what we got. This writer
hoped that the timetable would match the measure from
the Psalms:

#### Our days may come to seventy years,
##### or eighty, if our strength endures;
#### yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow,
##### for they quickly pass, and we fly away. 
###### - Psalm 90:10, NIV

Delving deeper, the “unroundness” of the numbers
explained itself: it was measuring not the average life of
seventy, nor the blessed life of eighty, nor Genesis’ life-limit
of one hundred twenty. Like Methuselah, whose life
measured the delay before the Great Flood, the pattern in
Ecclesiastes measures a particular life. It marks out the
years of Solomon.

Solomon was promised a long life if he remained faithful.
He failed. As his life ended abruptly at an odd and
unsymmetrical length, so shall our world. How long did
Solomon live? Trust me: we need to know.

## Solomon is the Measure of All Things

hornton, D. “When was Solomon born?” (2020) Referenced on
April 6, 2021 from https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/51218/how-old-was-solomon-when-he-became-king

Counting the years of Solomon’s life is a puzzle that has
confounded many historians. Estimates range from the
fifties on up to Josephus’ eighty. Pastor D. Thornton made a
commendable effort, so we will go with his analysis 
from [When was Solomon born?](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/51218/how-old-was-solomon-when-he-became-king).
Thornton’s chronology takes as a given that David and
Solomon each reigned forty years. The question then
becomes one of discovering in which year of David’s reign
Solomon was born.

  - **(7)** David reigned seven years in Hebron before conquering Jerusalem and moving the Ark there.
  - **(3)** David defeated the Arameans, then “in the course of time” (2 Samuel 10:1) battled the Ammonites. Thornton estimates this period between battles as a minimum of three years.
  - **(1)** “In the spring” (2 Samuel 11:1) David cohabited with Bathsheba. Thornton argues that this happened the following year, the eleventh year (7 + 3 + 1) of David’s reign.
  - **(1)** The first child died as a baby the following year, or later.
  - **(4)** Four more children were born (Shammua, Shobab, Nathan and Solomon, according to 1 Chronicles 3:5), with Solomon being the last. If they were born a year apart, that makes four years, and Solomon was born in the 16th year of David’s reign or later: 
  - **16 = 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4**

Thus, since David reigned 40 years, Solomon would be
40 – 16 = 24 years old or younger when he became king.
Adding his reign of forty years leads to an estimate of sixty-
four years for the span of Solomon’s life. Since Thornton’s
estimates are conservative, if any of the events were spaced
out further, then Solomon would have been born later,
hence lived fewer years. We shall adopt an age at death for
Solomon of sixty-three years and several months.

Where has the number sixty-three popped up before?
Oh, yeah. There will be sixty-three hundred years from the
creation to the end of the age. If a man of wisdom died after
sixty-three years, shall a world that thinks itself wise come
to an end after sixty-three centuries?

Ecclesiastes has more to tell us.

## A Tripartite Book

When speaking about the seven pieces of peace (the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.md) ), 
six years were assigned to each set of four times, which brings us to
maturity at age 42, not 49. This agreed well with the
number forty-two that popped up throughout the book.
However, cultural bias played a part. In America, students
graduate high school and can vote at age eighteen, so
ending the “emotional control” phase at 3 x 6 = 18 years
made sense. Nevertheless, age 21 is when we permit young
people to drink. Our culture tried other arrangements, but
legislation cannot not change certain human behaviors.
Impulse control needs a few more years.

For similar reasons the third phase was said to begin at
age 12, before puberty. It might be better to put the crisis
that propels a person into the next phase at the end of one
phase and not the beginning of the next. Moving backwards
further, age seven is called the age of accountability, when
the moral sense begins to sharpen in children.

Different people mature at different rates, so we have
latitude. Let us recast the seven stages of life to each last
seven years. (Fortunately, no earlier prophetic structures
relied on the stages lasting six years.) That brings the
loyalty stage and the time of peace to a close at age 49. That
is a significant number, the number of years in a jubilee
cycle. In ancient Israel, every forty-nine years all debts
were to be cancelled and all slaves freed. Such an event
would breathe new life into a person, giving them strength
to advance to the next phase of life.

Once mature, the next phase of life lasts a dozen years,
the most productive years of a person’s working life,
bringing us to age 61. The three phases that follow are
fungible: fortunate and well-prepared people can stretch
them out, while others see their trials multiply rapidly. On
Solomon’s schedule they came in rapid succession:

  - Days of darkness, crisis and fearful trials (age 62)
  - Rapid decline in mental and physical abilities (age 63)
  - Death (just before age 64)

These life segments break Ecclesiastes into pieces like so:

  - **Beginning**
    - 1:1–9:18. Birth to Maturity.
    - 10:1-4. Comparison of where the foolish and wise person stand at midlife.
  - **Middle**
    - 10:5–10:20. Activities of the Established worker.
    - 11:1-6. Assessment of the fruitfulness of the foolish and wise person late in life.
  - **End**
    - 11:7-10. Remember the days of darkness.
    - 12:1-5. Remember your creator, as your health declines.
    - 12:6-8. Remember him before the silver cord is severed. Prepare to die.
    - 12:9-14. Final exhortation to fear God.

Our earlier clock started the twenty-eight times in 960
BC, when Solomon dedicated the temple in Jerusalem. That
clock stopped in 2280 AD, at the end of the 27th era, the
time of war, though possibly extending into the beginning
of the time of peace. That clock showed Israel and the
church being raised up from infancy to full maturity, ready
for what God has prepared next. That story ends on an up
note. If Ecclesiastes is also to tell the story of a world aging,
losing its faculties, declining and dying, it must conceal a
clock that runs on a different schedule. This clock starts at
the beginning.

<span id="5"/>
## Tripartite Time

How long are the the divisions on this clock? If Solomon
lived a few months past sixty-three and our other clocks
run out in 6300 AM (2280 AD), then each year of Solomon’s
life corresponds to a century. How fitting! One hundred
years is 10 x 10, and ten is the human number of
completeness. By our decimal numbering system we have a
fondness for thinking of history in units of centuries. It
explains why finding the other patterns is hard. Regular
periods of 119, 120, or 240 years or the irregular periods
found in the other clocks do not synch well with how we
learned history from our textbooks.

Since we love to think in centuries, the Lord saw fit to
make it challenging to fit centuries to Ecclesiastes. Only by
recognizing that the twenty-eight times form seven groups
and each group covers seven years of a person’s life can we
make headway.

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>28 times -> 7 stages of life -> 49 years -> 49 centuries</p>
</div>

By this logic, one “time” on this clock lasts 4,900 years
divided by 28, or 175 years. How does that factor?

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>175 = 5 x 5 x 7 </p>
</div>

With [five](./5-is-for-grace.md) representing the harvest, repeating it twice
means a complete harvest, and multiplying that by [seven](./7-is-for-the-holy-spirit.md)
(divine completeness) conveys the idea of all the harvests
coming in. The only appearance of the number 175 in
scripture is as the length of Abraham’s life. The main
confirmation that it is a meaningful length of time is in the
prophecies it reveals, which we shall get to shortly. The
number’s main utility is in providing a rationale and a
name for the clock. Abraham is the father of many nations.
He is a type of God the Father, prepared to offer his son for
the life of the world. Thus we shall call this Solomon’s
Grand Father Clock.

The former clock in Ecclesiastes started with the
construction of the Temple of Solomon. The temple was a
place for sacrifice. Since Jesus was the greatest and final
sacrifice, that clock centered on the life of the Son of God, a
veritable Son-dial. That clock stops with the completion of
the twenty-eight times; it ends when Christ’s body, the
church, reaches maturity. This one is different. As we shall
later investigate, if Ecclesiastes has a Grand Father Clock
that starts when God fathered creation (at the beginning of
time) and a Son-dial (that begins when the temple was
dedicated), does it also conceal a clock centered on the
Holy Spirit starting from a third historical event? Time will
tell.

As we age, our sense of time changes. The years seem to
pass faster. Thus it is with this final clock. The “times” of
youth last 175 years, but the times that follow last but a
century. The outline is:

  - **Growth Years**: 28 periods of 175 years (4900 years total)
  - **Middle Years**: 12 periods of 100 years (1200 years total)
  - **Declining Years**: 2 periods of 100 years (200 years total)
  - **Death**: 1 period of less than a century (likely 30-50 years)

Note that we have [forty-two](./42-is-for-the-journey.html) complete periods followed
by a partial period. (How I love that number!)

This book has already sifted through history, selected
events that are prophetically significant and described
them. There is no need to repeat that. This walk through
history shall stop only to explain events or trends not
previously noted. See now how Solomon stretched out his
mind and reached all the way to the edge of eternity, but
not into it...

<span id="6"/>
## Growth Years (4020 BC – 880 AD)

In the Bible, the early years of history are sparse in
details. Thus for the first two stages of life (existence and
function) we shall match historical events to the entire 700
year period for the stage instead of to individual
corresponding 175-year times. After that, we match each
time to its 175-year period.

One implication of this is that for the period from 960 BC
to 880 AD, each year can be slotted into two “times”, one
from the earlier Solomon’s Clock and one from this Grand
Father clock. If there are two times tugging at the world,
might that not cause the friction and confusion we
experience when we try to decipher history? One time is
applied to the Body of Christ coming of age and the other is
applied to a world aging and dying. Birth and death are
intermixed.

To use an analogy from data science, you might propose
that the facts of Ecclesiastes present a Gaussian mixture
model. Two bell-curves with different centers are
superimposed upon one another. In its tangled form, such
a curve looks like a camel with two humps. The challenge is
to untangle the data points and cluster them into one or the
other of the two camel humps. The first hump is the world,
which peaks earlier and falls off. The second hump is the
church, which peaks later.

<br/>
<img class="center" src="images/mixed-gaussians.png" alt="Plot of mixed Gaussian functions" />
<br/>

We already identified the features relevant to the
church’s maturation. Now let’s do it for the world.

### Security / Existence (4020–3320 BC)

**A time to be born**: Adam & Eve created, Cain & Abel
born.

**A time to die**: Adam & Eve died spiritually, Cain slew
Abel – the first human to die physically.

**A time to plant**: Cain planted the crops he offered as
sacrifice, and following his exile, built the first city.
(Genesis 4:17)

**A time to uproot**: Adam & Eve expelled from Eden.
Cain becomes a “restless wanderer” in the land of Nod,
which means wandering. (Genesis 4:14-16)

This was the age when humanity came into existence.
The assignment of these four “times” is incontestable as
all four were manifest for the first time in history.

### Ability / Function (3320–2620 BC)

**A time to kill**: Lamech boasts of killing a young man in
a spirit of vengeance. (Genesis 4:23-24)

**A time to heal**: Noah was born during this time. His
name means “to bring relief” or “to comfort”.

**A time to tear down**: Genesis 6:1-4 describes the
corruption of the righteous line of Seth in a baffling
passage about the Nephilim, heroes of renown thought
by some to be the giant offspring of demons.

**A time to build**: Lamech’s sons are credited with
inventions such as tent making, bronze and iron
working, and musical instruments and advances in
animal husbandry. (Genesis 4:20-22)

This time is one of irony. The purpose of this stage of life
is to grow in one’s mental and physical capabilities.
However, it was the evil line of Cain whose minds grew
sharpest. And it was the products of mixed marriages
between the good and evil peoples that corrupted the
morals of the line of Seth. Whatever the Nephilim were,
they were strong in body, strong in courage, admired by
men but about to be torn down by God.

### Stability / Emotions (2620–1920 BC)

**A time to weep** (2620–2445 BC): 
*“The LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.”* 
(Genesis 6:6, NIV) In this era, it is the Lord that wept.

**A time to laugh** (2445–2270 BC): God destroyed the
earth by flood. It is written that the Lord “laughs at the
wicked” (Psalm 37:13), so surely he laughed as he
destroyed his enemies. Sadly, another man’s laughter
provoked a terrible curse. Ham mocked his father’s
nakedness and so Noah cursed him and his offspring
with a life of slavery. (Genesis 9:20-27)

If you consult the corresponding “under the sun”
passage for “a time to laugh” (as per the “Son-dial”), this
is what you find:

#### And I saw something else under the sun:
##### In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,
##### in the place of justice—wickedness was there.
#### I said to myself,
##### **“God will bring into judgment**
##### **both the righteous and the wicked,**
##### for there will be a time for every activity,
##### a time to judge every deed.”
#### I also said to myself,
##### “As for humans, God tests them so that they
##### may see that they are **like the animals**. 
##### Surely **the fate of human beings is like that**
##### **of the animals**; the same fate awaits them both:
##### As one dies, so dies the other. All have 
##### the same breath; humans have no advantage
##### over animals. Everything is meaningless.
###### - Ecclesiastes 3:16-19, NIV

The striking thing is that this word of judgement applies
to both man and beast. The Flood of Noah is the only
judgment by God that is intimately concerned with both
human and animal life.

**A time to mourn** (2270–2095 BC): We mourn when
we lose something precious. Mankind lost its unity. God
ruined the Tower of Babel, confused the tongues of
men, and scattered the peoples, bringing about many
races and cultures that would henceforth war against
one another in distrust and enmity.

**A time to dance** (2095–1920 BC): Out of all those
peoples, God found a man of faith and called to Abram
to leave his home and go to the land that He would show
him. Dancing is about expressing joy. We rejoice at the
end, when at last we possess what we longed for. God
rejoices at the beginning, because He can see the end
from the beginning. When Abraham believed God and it
was credited to him as righteousness, surely the angels
danced! David, Christ, apostles, church – all became
possibilities when Abraham’s faith gave birth to Isaac.

### Amity / Relationships (1920–1220 BC)

**A time to scatter stones** (1920–1745 BC): These were
the years of the wandering of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
Abraham separated from Lot, Isaac from Ishmael, and
Jacob from Esau. The family was scattered.

**A time to gather stones** (1745–1570 BC): Joseph rose
to leadership in Egypt and aided by God’s providence as
expressed in a seven-year famine, gathered Jacob and
his brothers to join him there.

**A time to embrace** (1570–1395 BC): Finally, in Moses
and Joshua, the people of Israel find leaders whom they
could embrace, men who wholeheartedly embraced
God. In the “Son-dial”, the corresponding “under the
sun” passage includes these verses:

#### The sleep of a laborer is sweet,
##### whether they eat little or much,
#### but as for the rich, their abundance
##### permits them no sleep.
#### I have seen a grievous evil under the sun:
##### wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
###### or wealth lost through some misfortune,
#### so that when they have children
##### there is nothing left for them to inherit.
###### - Ecclesiastes 5:12-14, NIV

Two groups of people are contrasted. The laborers (the
Hebrew slaves) can sleep well, because God rescues
them from bondage. The rich (the Egyptians), cannot
sleep for fear of retaliation by the people they oppress.
When Moses led the people out of Egypt, it says that
they plundered the Egyptians, who gave them gifts of
gold and other precious things out of fear of the God
who had ravaged their nation. This wealth given away
was then not available to be inherited by their children,
many of whom had already died in the plague on the
firstborn.

**A time to refrain** (1395–1220 BC): During the time of
the Judges, relationships between the tribes were
strained once more.

The first lesson God was teaching Abraham and his
descendants during this stage was forgiveness, without
which all relationships fray and break. It is the climax of
Genesis, when Joseph forgave his brothers. It is the
climax of Job (who lived in this era), when he forgave his
friends. It was what saved Israel from God’s
unrestrained wrath in the desert, when Moses pleaded
with God to spare the people after they disobeyed.

The second lesson was shared suffering, which bound
the people together. It was the years in Egypt and the
desert that made them a nation even before they owned
an acre of land.

### Opportunity/ Resources (1220–520 BC)

**A time to search** (1220–1045 BC): From the period of
the Judges through the disastrous reign of Saul, the
people searched desperately for a strong leader.

**A time to give up** (1045–870 BC): They gave up their
search when David was anointed by Samuel. Sadly, the
nation would later give up their unity in a civil war.

**A time to keep** (870–695 BC): Israel was lost to
Assyria, but God kept Judah, under the godly reigns of
Hezekiah and Josiah.

**A time to throw away** (695–520 BC): Judah threw
away their last chance so God threw them away, into
exile.

These were the years when first Israel and then Judah
possessed the greatest opportunities and material
resources. What did it avail them?

### Community / Communication (520 BC–180 AD)

**A time to tear** (520–345 BC): Jews like Esther had been
torn away from their homeland, yet played their part in
preserving the people in exile.

**A time to mend** (345–170 BC): The fallout from
Alexander’s conquest was the more benign rule of the
Ptolemies, which permitted Judah to rebuild and
recover. They began to translate the Old Testament into
Greek and Jewish culture spread.

**A time to be silent** (170 BC–5 AD): These were the
years of silence between the Testaments, when there
were no prophets in Israel. The Septuagint was
completed, giving more people access to the words God
had already spoken. They studied them hoping to
understand what God was up to. Many of the people
became thirsty to hear again from God.

**A time to speak** (5–180 AD): The Word of God became
flesh and sent his apostles to spread his message to the
world.

When I saw how these four times of communication
aligned with history, my doubts concerning the validity
of this clock vanished. If you compare this clock to the
former one, the progression is clear. Here we have Jesus
presenting the Gospel to the Jews. In the Son-dial, it was
the era when Christian missionaries shared the Gospel
with the greater part of the world.

In the “Son-dial”, the time to speak and the time to love
center around these verses:

#### Go, **eat your food** with gladness, 
#### and **drink your wine** with a joyful heart, 
#### for God has already approved what you do. 
#### Always be clothed in white, and always
#### **anoint your head with oil**. Enjoy life
#### with **your wife**, whom you love, all the days
#### of this meaningless life that God has given
#### you under the sun— all your meaningless days.
#### For this is your lot in life and in your
#### toilsome labor under the sun. Whatever your
#### hand finds to do, do it with all your might,
#### for **in the realm of the dead**, 
#### **where you are going,** there is neither
#### working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 9:7-10, NIV

In that clock, we applied this passage to the missionary
age, when the church would work its hardest to spread
the gospel to the world. In this clock, it applies to Jesus.
The food and wine are the Last Supper. The phrase
“anoint your head with oil” identifies the person as the
Christ, which means “anointed one”. Next, the wife is
the bride of Christ – the church – which came into being
at that time. As for “the realm of the dead”, that speaks
of our Lord’s crucifixion and descent into Hell. So you
see, Solomon again nailed the Lord’s coming down to
the right century.

### Loyalty (180–880 AD)

A time to love (180–355 AD): With Constantine’s
embrace of Christianity, the greatest threat to the
church was nullified. In His love, God gave Rome to his
people as their possession.

**A time to hate** (355–530 AD): This era saw the sack of
Rome in 410 AD and its fall in 476 AD. Civil war and a
growing divide between the eastern and western halves
of the empire spelled division.

**A time for war** (530–705 AD): Chief among the martial
disasters of this era was the First Islamic Jihad, costing
the Byzantine Empire most of the Middle East.
A time for peace (705–880 AD): The eastern frontier
stabilized and the west became unified under
Charlemagne and his successors. Christianity spread
throughout most of Europe. The close of the seventh
and final Ecumenical Council meant that orthodox
Christian doctrine was completely defined – it was
mature.

As the great empire fractured, something never before
seen in the annals of history arose. For all the wars and
political struggles, all the language and cultural
divisions, the people of a continent gave their loyalty to
one man who had died but rose again. What would that
loyalty accomplish?

<span id="7"/>
## Productive Years (880 – 2080 AD)

At this point the Grand Father Clock strikes ten – chapter
ten. This chapter of Ecclesiastes is all about work. To break
it into pieces we do not have “under the sun” as an easy
delimiter as we did for the times, nor the word
“remember” as we will find in the next section. Instead,
each part concerns a single facet of work. The sections
range from half a verse to four verses in length. Each is a
parable of great subtlety.

In an earlier chapter, the opening of the seals of
Revelation was likened to the pulling down of scaffolding to
reveal a new building. The old political, religious, economic
and cultural systems were torn away to reveal the new.
Along the same vein, this chapter describes the building of
a great house. Forgive me for updating the analogies.

Note: Solomon also used the metaphor of a house
prophetically in Psalm 127, as explored in “Appendix D: To
Number our Psalms”.

**Hiring the GC (880–980 AD).**

#### There is an evil I have seen under the sun,
##### the sort of error that arises from a ruler:
#### Fools are put in many high positions,
##### while the rich occupy the low ones.
#### I have seen slaves on horseback,
##### while princes go on foot like slaves. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:5-7

To begin, we need a GC – a general contractor. Once
people reach their most productive years, recruiting,
interviewing and hiring competent and trustworthy people
is a vital concern. In these verses, Solomon tells us that
from the start, things wouldn’t go well. From Pope Sergius
III to Pope John XII, the selection of church leaders
succumbed to the murderous scheming of Theodora and
Marozia during the "rule of the harlots". Spiritually, this was
one of the darkest times for the church.

This era is known for one significant positive event. Near
the beginning of the tenth century, in Aleppo, Syria, the
Aleppo Codex was written by Jewish scholars. This was the
most important and influential copy of the Masoretic Text
of the Old Testament to be created. Descendants of that
text influenced the translation of the King James Bible.

**Digging the Foundation (980–1080 AD).**

#### Whoever digs a pit may fall into it... 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:8a

Trench collapse is a common cause of injury and death in
construction. Two decades ago, fifty workers a year died in
the trenches in the US, prompting OSHA to conduct a major
study and tighten standards. One discovery was that at
many job sites, the supervising engineer never bothered to
ascertain the soil type before planning the excavation.
Knowing the soil type is one of the most crucial factors in
understanding and mitigating risk. Jesus preached a whole
sermon on the importance of knowing what type of soil
each person is: beaten path, rocky, thorny or good. Jesus
would have made a good construction engineer.
This verse, however, talks about a different kind of pit:
schism. In 1054, the Great Schism finally and irrevocably
split the church into East and West. The English word
schism comes from the Greek σχίσµα, which means
division, cleft, fissure, or break. The fissure that opened up
between the two halves of Christendom would lead to the
death or suffering of millions. The cost of digging the
foundation for our house was great.

**Demolition & Site Prep (1080–1180 AD).**

#### ... whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:8b

During excavation, the remains of previous construction
may be uncovered. Old walls will have to be demolished
and hauled out of the pit. In this case, the walls needing to
be breached during the construction of Christendom were
the walls of Jerusalem during the First Crusade. The snakes
biting the workers were the soldiers of the Caliphate, the
empire associated with the seventh beast of Revelation.
Recall that with Satan bound for a thousand years
beginning in 380 AD, he is held behind a wall. If you reach
into his prison, he will bite! The Christian kingdoms had
been hemmed in for centuries by the relentless expansion
of Islam, but now they broke through the wall. However,
was it Christians breaking in, or Satan angling for a way to
break out?

**Deliveries & Masonry Work (1180–1280 AD).**

#### Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them... 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:9a

A modern work site sees an endless stream of trucks
dropping off supplies. The masonry work may require
marble, granite, brick, natural stone or cinder blocks. This
verse, about quarrying stone, is the most on-the-nose verse
in the chapter. This century was the peak of the age of
church building. Many of the great cathedrals were
constructed during this century. It is estimated that during
this phase of the establishment of Christendom, more stone
was quarried for churches than was used for all the
pyramids and temples of Ancient Egypt combined.

Not only buildings, but also vital church institutions were
built during this century. Religious orders like the
Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and Augustinians
trace their founding to this time.

Sadly, many of the common people who built the church
died at its hands due to injustice. During the Fourth
Crusade, Christian killed Christian when Constantinople
was sacked. The Inquisition began in 1184 AD and the
Albigensian Crusade was launched against the Cathars,
killing tens of thousands.

During the Albigensian Crusade, a French Cistercian
monk named Arnold Amalric acted as the Pope’s
representative. When the crusaders reached Beziers, a
soldier asked Amalric how they would distinguish between
the townspeople that were Catholics and the ones that were
Cathars. Amalric is reputed to have answered, “Kill them
all. God will recognize his own.” Over time, this has been
paraphrased as “Kill them all and let God sort them out.”
And that is how the builders were injured at their own
quarry.

**Carpentry & Framing (1280–1380 AD)**

#### ... whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.
#### If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened,
##### more strength is needed,
###### but skill will bring success. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:9b-10, NIV

With the base of the building done, we can frame the
exterior and interior walls. In this verse, the emphasis is on
working with dull tools. What are those tools? Intellect.
Leadership. Coordination and cooperation. Character.
Public order. All were deficient during this tumultuous
century, forcing select people of ability to envision new
ways to organize society.

The Black Death was the shattering tragedy that forced
the issue, killing off half of Europe or more. The Avignon
Papacy (1309-1378 AD) had the Pope flee Rome for most of
the era, as well as having multiple popes claiming the title
at once. In the intellectual sphere, scholastic theology was
an attempt to sharpen the church’s reason and carry it
beyond the ideas of the ancient world. Some of its results
led in wrong directions and made faith complex and
unintelligible to the masses. Also, this cerebral approach
prompted opposition to the East’s focus on Hesychasm, a
personal, spiritual relationship with God. This era also saw
substantial development toward modern nation-states, the
interior walls between the new countries arising out of old
Rome. All in all, old, dull tools were being discarded in
search of sharp new ones to handle a new age.

**Zoning, Payables & Receivables (1380–1480 AD)**

#### If a snake bites before it is charmed,
##### the charmer receives no fee. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:11

All of a sudden, the work stops. The electrician wants to
be paid up front but your bridge loan wasn’t approved by
the bank. The neighbors at the zoning board meeting
complain about increased traffic, site drainage, and the
height of the flag pole. The town building inspector says the
building code changed and the roof trusses must be spaced
closer. The bricklayers union goes on strike. It would be so
easy to just burn it down and collect the insurance...

This period began with the Western Schism (with more
multiplications of popes battling for legitimacy from
1378-1416 AD) and only got worse, as Constantinople fell to
the Turks in 1453 AD. After a thousand years of
confinement, Satan slipped his bonds and broke out of
prison in 1380 AD. Don’t pay the snake charmer: he fell
asleep on the job.

(Every eschatological system assigns a different time to
the imprisonment and release of Satan. The strength of the
system in this book is that the same event shows up in
many clocks at the same corresponding time, reinforcing
this assertion.)

**Marketing (1480–1580 AD).**

#### Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious,
##### but fools are consumed by their own lips.
#### At the beginning their words are folly;
##### at the end they are wicked madness—
###### and **fools multiply words**.
#### No one knows what is coming—
##### who can tell someone else what will happen after them?
#### The toil of fools wearies them;
##### they do not know the way to town.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:12-15

It is finally time to list the property with realtors. Can the
house we are building be successfully sold by the folks on
the TV show Million Dollar Listing? Before the open house,
it is smart to fill the rooms with furniture, hang a few
pictures, place vases of fresh cut flowers and cover the
kitchen island with tapas. During this century, the church
filled its house by plundering the New World of gold, silver,
firs, potatoes, tomatoes, maize and chocolate, fruits of the
Colombian Exchange.

However, the phrase from Ecclesiastes that best describes
this time is “fools multiply words”. At the close of the
previous century, Gutenberg created his first press (1439
AD) and printed his first Bible (1455 AD). Sure, the Chinese
already had moveable type, but they used ceramic type,
which didn’t hold the ink well, and used water-based
paints, which bled and faded fast. Gutenberg invented type
metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony, which was
durable but also easily moldable and held the ink well.
Gutenberg had access to oil paints developed during the
High Renaissance. From them he designed an oil-based ink
vastly superior to the water-based inks used before him. On
top of that, he constructed a special type matrix that
enabled a printer to create new fonts or special symbols
rapidly.

As the century of this era dawned, printing presses
popped up all over Europe. Writing and literacy expanded.
Now the fools (and the wise) had their market for writing
more than just Bibles. The Protestant Reformation shook
the world. Books and pamphlets filled with every sort of
innovation in philosophy, religion, economics and politics
found an audience and the explosion of ideas led to real
explosions as wars gripped the world. The Age of Marketing
had begun.

**Negligent Subcontractors (1580–1680 AD).**

#### Woe to the land whose king was a servant
##### and whose princes feast in the morning.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:16

The property may be up for sale, but the subcontractors
are still working their way through the final punch list.
Some of them cut corners to finish in time – or so they
could head to the pub for a drink.

This century was convulsed by the General Crisis that
swept across Europe, Asia, North and South America, and
parts of Africa. Leaders had to contend with the poor
climate of the Little Ice Age, inflationary pressure from bulk
importation of silver from the Americas, religious
controversy flowing from the Reformation and the
clamoring of the poor for freedom and justice. Emblematic
of this century was a man from the very bottom of the
aristocracy (and by income, initially below it) who rose to
command a great nation. Oliver Cromwell led the
revolution that toppled – and executed – the King of
England. That revolution did spell woe to England for
decades, as this servant who displaced their king served an
extremist agenda that nearly brought the nation to ruin.

**Conscientious subcontractors (1680–1780 AD).**

#### Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth
##### and whose princes eat at a proper time—
###### for strength and not for drunkenness.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:17, NIV

After you fire the negligent contractors, you hope their
replacements do a better job. Many kings and queens of the
eighteenth century embraced the enlightenment. They
freed serfs, established colleges for women, protected
religious minorities, funded public health measures and
pursued other notable reforms. Among their ranks were
Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, Catherine the Great of
Russia and Frederick the Great of Prussia – the three great
enlightenment monarchs. Their lands truly were blessed.

**Roofing & Maintenance (1780–1880 AD).**

#### Through laziness, the rafters sag;
##### because of idle hands, the house leaks.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:18

The house is complete, the title transferred and the
family all moved in. Now the owners are responsible for it
going forward. Will they be attentive or neglectful? The
article [Why Monarchy? The Rise and Demise of a Regime Type](./https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342892278_Why_Monarchy_The_Rise_and_Demise_of_a_Regime_Type)
by Gerring et al has the answer.

Two visuals in the article tell the story. In Europe,
starting in 1790 AD, the number of monarchies in the world
began to plummet, partially as a result of consolidation into
fewer nation states. By 1870, this wave washed over the rest
of the world. Starting in 1920 AD (in the fallout from World
War I) the number of non-monarchies surged. All these
kingdoms – these royal houses – sagged and then collapsed.

**Furnishing & Feasting (1880–1980 AD).**

#### A feast is made for laughter,
##### wine makes life merry,
###### and money is the answer for everything.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:19

For the house that stands, the diligent owners enjoy a
year of ease. They fill their house with luxuries and
celebrate life. During this century the material wealth of the
world increased vastly – twenty-fold by some measures.
Sadly, it has spawned generations more convinced than
ever that *“money is the answer for everything”*.

**Privacy (1980–2080 AD).**

#### Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,
##### or curse the rich in your bedroom,
#### because a bird in the sky may carry your words,
##### and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:20

As couples get older, they like to relax in the privacy of
their home among trusted friends. Privacy is what this
century is tossing aside, leading to hate, cancel culture,
unforgiveness, and violence. For us “the bird in the sky” is
a spy satellite or plane and “a bird on the wing” is a drone
or a nosy bystander with a cell phone. The surveillance
state and its private version, the social network, intrude
more each year. The “time of hate” is almost upon us, but
its tools are in place and being wielded by an emboldened
elite seeking to destroy their enemies at all costs.

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>We have been warned:</p>
  <p>the most important skills to develop during the</p>
  <p>coming years are diplomacy and tact.</p>
</div>

These tools of oppression would be destructive enough
in the hands of rational, mentally stable people in full
possession of their faculties. However, that is not the sort of
people who will inherit them. The world is going senile.
What would Orwell’s 1984 be like if Big Brother had
Alzheimer’s? We are about to see...

**IRS Audit.**

#### Ship your grain across the sea;
##### after many days you may receive a return.
#### Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;
##### you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:1-2

In “Winding the Clock”, a comprehensive analysis of this
passage and much of the rest of Ecclesiastes 11 was
presented. There the “ventures” were interpreted as
centuries (consistent with this clock). The auditor’s report
was that seven full centuries plus part of an eighth from the
past millennium would be productive, and so they were. A
few came near the start (the morning) and the rest towards
the end (the evening). As Solomon said,

#### “Sow your seed in the **morning**,
##### and at **evening** let your hands not be idle,
#### for you do not know which will succeed
#### whether this or that, or
##### whether both will do equally well.”
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:6

Those eight ventures are complete. Will we earn enough
from our savings and investment to last us through
retirement? In case you were thinking of working past
retirement age, remember what Jesus said:

#### As long as it is day,
#### we must do the works of him who sent me.
#### Night is coming, when no one can work.
###### - John 9:4

<span id="8"/>
## Declining Years (2080 – 2280 AD) & Death (?)

From the middle of the eleventh chapter through the end
of the twelfth, we have the world’s years of decline.
Everything written in this book so far has come to pass. We
must accept what Ecclesiastes has to say about the times to
come and not fight against it. The wise will find a way to
obey God, find comfort in His word and fruitfulness in their
work even in dire times, because the church is not going to
die; it will emerge from the wreckage of this world strong
and in the prime of life. Choose your loyalties carefully;
they will be tested.

The years going forward are approximate. Medical
science may prolong life greatly, at God’s sufferance, and
extend one of these times. He may also cut them short.

As I write this page, the funeral of Prince Philip has just
concluded. The journalists interspersed video of the
proceedings with memories of his life. We should take time
to remember our own lives and all the history that has
passed. Remember, learn and prepare.

**The Days of Darkness (2080–2180 AD)**

#### Light is sweet,
##### and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
#### However many years anyone may live,
##### let them enjoy them all.
#### But let them **remember the days of darkness**,
##### **for there will be many**.
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:7-8

This tells us that there will be days of light ahead, but the
dark days will multiply.

#### Everything to come is meaningless.
#### You who are young,
##### be happy while you are young,
#### and let your heart give you joy
##### in the days of your youth.
#### Follow the ways of your heart
##### and whatever your eyes see,
#### but know that for all these things
##### God will bring you into judgment.
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:9

Though the Teacher tells us the days ahead are
meaningless, that is not entirely so. Days lived in obedience
to God will not be meaningless, but the days lived by
worldly people will. There is also a paradox in the charge to
“follow the ways of your heart”. I cringe every time I hear a
pop song or show tune that tells people to follow their
heart. Following the ways of a bad heart will lead to
judgment.

#### So then, banish anxiety from your heart
##### and cast off the troubles of your body,
###### for youth and vigor are meaningless.
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:10

Thanks to advances in medical science, this next century
may be the first when people can “cast off the troubles of
[their] body”. What a tragic waste it will be when millions,
cured of complex ailments, are left with a fit body but a
withered soul that cannot make meaningful use of it.

**The Days of Decline (2180–2280 AD)**

#### Remember your Creator
#### in the days of your youth,
#### before the days of trouble come
#### and the years approach when you will say,
##### “I find no pleasure in them”—
#### before the sun and the light
#### and the moon and the stars grow dark,
#### and the clouds return after the rain...
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:1-2

If the previous century afforded people ample access to
meaningless pleasure, in this one pleasure will be
impossible to find. For an ordinary person during most of
history, the analogies here and in the succeeding verses are
clear. Time is running out (sun, moon & stars), though
some commentators maintain this refers to the face, now
wrinkled and robbed of the glory of its former beauty.
Eyesight is failing, plagued by cataracts and clogged with
tears. In succeeding verses, “the keepers of the house” that
tremble are feeble hands, and the strong man that stoops is
a bad back and wobbly legs. The grinders that are few are
your teeth, and so it goes to the end of the passage.

How will God apply this parable to the world? We saw
that chapter ten was not just an OSHA manual about
worker safety. It was a real analogy to history, to the
systematic construction of a civilization. So it shall be here.
The allusions are not merely poetic, but prophetic. If it
describes troubles in the city and troubles in the country,
so it shall be. If the grinders are few and the pitcher at the
well breaks, it may indicate a failure in the water supply, in
irrigation systems and the whole agricultural system.

Verse 5 seems clearest. It says that *“people are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets”*. 
This indicates widespread crime and violence. Most people will lose the
courage to face the trials of life. They will lose all ambition
to climb the heights of accomplishment because the chaos
around them voids all prospect of success. 
*“Then people go to their eternal home and mourners go about the streets.” *
The rising death toll will claim so many friends and family that
mourning will become an everyday thing.

A careful study of every phrase in this chapter could
reveal more about events in those latter days. I haven’t the
heart for it. The people described in chapter twelve try to
find pleasure apart from God, but end up with judgment
and mourning. Only the wise who willingly tarry at the
House of Mourning early in life and learn what it has to
teach are prepared for those days. Those trials will sadden
but not destroy people of faith. The song of birds may grow
faint to some, but the ears of faith will never miss the
strains of the final trumpet, when Christ comes for his own.

In previous clocks and the first two stages of this one, it
was matching historical events to Scripture that made the
duration of each period clear. These events are yet to come
and so we cannot ascertain their meaning, considering that
even having all of past history spread out before me did not
make many prior correlations obvious. Though the
meaning may be elusive, we nevertheless have hope of
comprehending the timing.

The *growth years* comprised 4,900 years, or 700 years
times seven phases of growth. That translates to one
hundred jubilee cycles of forty-nine years each.

The *productive years* will have comprised 1,200 years.
Though we divided it as twelve centuries, it may also be
expressed as ten generations of 120 years each, a unit we
have seen before.

Within the *declining years*, how will God divide this
second century? If the first verse is an introduction and the
latter part of verse 5 (“Then people go to their eternal home
and mourners go about the streets”) is a concluding
statement, that leaves fourteen word pictures:

  - two in verse 2 (beauty gone, storm clouds),
  - four in verse 3 (weak hands & legs, lost teeth, poor eyesight),
  - four in verse 4 (closed mouth, chewing, skittish, poor hearing), and 
  - four in verse 5 (fear of falling, white hair, shuffling walk, no desire).

If each picture corresponds to seven years, that makes
ninety-eight years, or two complete jubilee cycles. That
leaves two years of the century for people to “go to their
eternal home”.

Back to the jubilee cycle. Scholars argue about whether it
lasts forty-nine or fifty years. Some have seven weeks of
seven years (forty-nine) for the sabbath cycle, then the
fiftieth as the jubilee year. Then they split again on their
opinion, with some saying that the jubilee year doubles as
the first year of the next cycle but others saying the jubilee
year is outside the sabbath cycle. This is like it was with the
generations, where in one place the period is 120 years that
do not overlap but in another they overlap, making for 119
years between the start of one generation and the start of
the next. What do we get if we instead choose fifty years as
a jubilee cycle?

  - The growth years occupy 98 jubilee cycles
  - The productive years last 24 cycles
  - The declining years last 4 more cycles
  - 126 jubilee cycles in all.

In that case the fourteen events of chapter twelve, verses
2-5 last two jubilee cycles. The first seven images last forty-
nine years plus one jubilee year and the second seven the
same, for a nice round century. Much tidier, no?

What can we make of the number 126?

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>126 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 7</p>
</div>

We have the numbers for the Son, the Father (twice), and
the Holy Spirit. What else? When I saw the number 126, I
immediately thought of Psalm 126, whose inscription is “A
song of Ascents.”

#### When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion,
##### we were like those who **dreamed**.
#### Our mouths were filled with **laughter**,
##### our tongues with songs of **joy**.
#### Then it was said among the nations,
##### “The LORD has done great things for them.”
#### The LORD has done great things for us,
##### and we are filled with joy.
#### Restore our fortunes, LORD,
##### like streams in the Negev.
#### Those who **sow with tears**
##### will **reap** with songs of **joy**.
#### Those who go out **weeping**,
##### carrying seed to sow,
#### will return with songs of **joy**,
##### **carrying sheaves** with them.
###### - Psalm 126:1-6, NIV

The people of Judah would sing this song while climbing
the hill leading up to Jerusalem, to celebrate their
deliverance. Recall that when I was young, I dreamt about
climbing a hill that leads to heaven. This Psalm has it all –
dreaming, climbing, and the whole harvest cycle. Twice it
speaks of sowing seed (which is Jesus, the Word) and twice
of reaping a harvest. There are streams in the desert – the
Holy Spirit watering our hearts to promote growth. Four
times it speaks of joy (the fruit of the Holy Spirit), once of
laughter, and the audience is the whole world.

I found this Psalm after my many months of meditating
on Habakkuk and when I met Janet Sullivan, this Psalm
became my reality. At that time I carried seed to her
(Christian music and a few minutes of Bible reading), I went
out weeping, but minutes later was filled with joy and
reaped a spiritual harvest.

Yes, Psalm 126 can be likened to the great harvest at the
end of the age. On that day, we shall ascend.

**The Day of Death (?)**

Would you have the courage to go on living if you knew
in advance the day of your death? The Lord calls us to such
courage.

#### Teach us to number our days,
##### that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
###### - Psalm 90:12, NIV

It is July, 2021 as I write. The CDC just reported that in
2020, life expectancy in the US declined by 1.5 years, the
steepest drop since World War II. The causes are COVID-19,
overdoses from synthetic opioids and suicide. The
government is numbering our days. Actuaries are
numbering our days. However, before them all, Solomon
numbered his own days.

This chapter proposed and supported the conjecture that
Solomon lived sixty-three years and a few months. He
mirrored in his life the principles in his book: forty-nine
years to mature, twelve at work, and almost three to reflect
before death claimed him. Did he know years in advance
that he would never reach his sixty-fourth birthday? Did he
figure out the divine riddle hidden in his own words?

The numbering of days is more than counting. It is
planning, apportioning, reflecting, and evaluating – and
gratitude for however many they may be. In this more
important sense, Solomon is our teacher. He counted those
days carefully. He judged the days he wasted and the days
he flourished and his restless mind sought a path to peace.
To ponder his mixture of success and failure can be
discouraging. The antidote is to marvel at the magnitude of
the blessings Christ has showered upon his children. By the
Holy Spirit, we have that peace that evaded Solomon’s
grasp. We do not count our days alone; Christ counts them
with us and guides us toward better ways to spend them
than our earthly wisdom could ever discover. One way he
guides us is to remember…

#### **Remember** him—before the **silver** cord is severed,
##### and the **golden bowl** is broken;
#### before the pitcher is shattered at the **spring**,
##### and the **wheel** broken at the well,
#### and the **dust** returns to the ground it came from,
##### and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
#### “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.
##### “Everything is meaningless!”
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:6-8

Whether the silver cord is our spinal cord or the invisible
tether to our soul, it will break. Whether the golden bowl is
our brain and intellectual capabilities or our position of
respect and responsibility in society, it will break. Whether
the pitcher at the spring describes incontinence or the
chambers of the heart, it will break. Whether the wheel at
the well is the aorta or some other vital organ, it will break.
All of us will turn to dust. If these are analogies to future
events, what do they mean?

I don’t know, but here are things of God that employ
some of these analogies. I make no claim that Ecclesiastes
predicts them, merely that they are a fit counterpoint to
Solomon’s words.

#### For you know that it was not with **perishable things**
#### **such as silver or gold** that you were redeemed from
#### the empty way of life handed
#### down to you from your ancestors...
###### - 1 Peter 1:18, NIV

Peter described the perishable silver and gold we
foolishly pursue, which perishes just as Solomon said.
Zephaniah says much the same, but also adds references to
dust and blindness, recalling the previous section:

#### “I will bring such distress on all people
##### that they will grope about like those who are **blind**,
##### because they have sinned against the LORD.
#### Their blood will be poured out like **dust**
#### and their entrails like dung.
#### Neither their **silver** nor their **gold**
##### will be able to save them
###### on the day of the LORD’s wrath.”
#### In the fire of his jealousy
##### the whole earth will be consumed,
#### for he will make a sudden end
##### of all who live on the earth.
###### - Zephaniah 1:17-18

But in Revelation, the Lord also spoke of a different kind
of gold, which does not perish, and a salve to restore sight:

#### I counsel you to buy from me **gold refined in the fire**,
##### so you can become rich; 
#### and white clothes to wear,
##### so you can cover your shameful nakedness;
#### and **salve to put on your eyes**,
##### **so you can see**.
###### - Revelation 3:18

When it comes to the bowl, we have the seven bowl
judgments of Revelation 16. Here the contrast is clearest.
Our bowl is broken, God’s bowls are not. We are impotent;
He is powerful. As our world breaks down, God’s kingdom
will just be entering into its great power.

#### “As I looked, thrones were set in place,
##### and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
#### His clothing was as white as snow;
##### the hair of his head was white like wool.
#### His throne was flaming with fire,
##### and its **wheels** were all ablaze.
###### - Daniel 7:9

This passage of Daniel and the wheel in a wheel passages
of Ezekiel chapters one and ten are perplexing. Does God
ride a chariot? The important thing to take away is the
same. Our wheels will break. God’s fiery wheels turn
forever.

#### He said to me:
##### “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega,
###### the Beginning and the End.
##### To the thirsty I will give water without cost
###### from the **spring of the water of life**.
###### - Revelation 21:6

The pitcher we use to draw water from the spring will
break, but God offers us the water of life from His spring.
All these things are clear. The terrors that God will visit
upon the world ought to convince everyone to turn back
and repent, but most will refuse. How is that possible?

###### - 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3

I believe that the reference to “peace and safety”
indicates Solomon’s final time of peace. God will offer a
brief reprieve from the force of His wonders, and wicked
fools will think they won. We made it! God or nature or fate
threw everything at us, and we survived! We can do
anything! We can rebuild! We can live forever without God!

And so they shall, because they will not have listened to
Solomon. They will choose not to remember, for if they
remembered, they might see their need to change, fear God
and repent.

**The Reprieve**

Why should we expect God might offer a reprieve? For
how long? Solomon’s times from chapter three reflect a
lunar cycle, which in reality lasts not twenty-eight days, but
27.3217. That makes the final day, “a time for peace”, a short
day. We shall explore that observation in the concluding
chapter, “Peace in His Time”. It yields a period of 38.6
years.

Ecclesiastes twelve offers an alternate way to measure
that time. Since each analogy in the first few verses seems
to correspond to seven years, have we any things to count
here?

  - Silver cord
  - Golden bowl
  - Pitcher at the spring
  - Wheel at the well
  - Dust
  - The human spirit’s return to God

The last is the final act. For the Christian, it is the
rapture. For the rest, judgement. If the first five last a full
seven years (35 years) then the sixth can range anywhere
from a day to seven more years should it be “cut short”.
This gives us a range of 35 to 42 years. (There’s that number
again!) That range is consistent with the value of 38.6 years
based on the lunar cycle.

If those six images are projected onto the world, they
paint a picture of a failed harvest. The silver cord is the
cord that binds people together in cooperation. Severing it
brings anarchy. The golden bowl is what we eat from. When
it breaks, the food supply is disrupted and people die of
hunger. The pitcher at the spring is the public water supply.
When it breaks, people die of thirst. The wheel at the well
is the irrigation system, and wheels in general represent the
transportation system. When the wheel breaks, the fields
die from drought and what little food is left rots in the
warehouses, undelivered. All that is left are fields of dust, a
desert. Then everyone despairs utterly and their souls die.

(See “Psalm 135: Four Harvests” for another foray into
Ecclesiastes 12. That chapter compares the consequences of
idolatry found in the psalm to the physical infirmities
described by Solomon and provides a more spiritual
interpretation of this passage.)

That is the spirit and tone of Ecclesiastes twelve.

There is another spirit. There is a Holy Spirit and that Spirit has a clock, too.

(The clock to which I allude in the statement above is described in the 
chapter "Solving the Historical Psalms".)
