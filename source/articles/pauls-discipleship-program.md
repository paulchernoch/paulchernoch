## Buried in the Noise

For a decade or more, I taught Sunday School. I knew a lot about the Bible and Christianity, so
I was never at a loss for something to teach. Nevertheless, I didn't have any idea whether I was 
overlooking important topics. Did my lessons have gaps? If I were to disciple an adult, would
I be able to present the whole gospel?

The church has experts in systematic theology. Denominations create creeds, catechisms, lesson plans 
and curricula to assist. You can get lost in it all. I know I did. Wouldn't it be nice if the Bible 
were more systematic instead of historical and all over the map? The arrangement of stories and ideas
is almost as messy as my tool shed!

It was while studying Job for my book on resilience that I detected the first hidden sign of coherence.
Sprinkled among his nine speeches, Job issued a series of pleas, setting forth all the qualities he needed in a savior. While researching that book I found eight; a ninth turned up while I was preparing my book on Ecclesiastes. 
Those nine requirements I called Job's "job requirements for a savior". They not only fit Jesus to a T, 
they matched nine events in the Lord's ministry **in chronological order**.

That is systematic. A careful student of Job will therefore come to understand the many dimensions of salvation.
Of course, different denominations argue about the *Ordo Salutis*, or order of salvation. 
Which parts of the process happen in which sequence? To answer that question you need to wade into another 
round of scholarly debates. Much to my surprise, when studying Psalm 19 for *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, 
I was stunned to discover the whole order of salvation present. (In other parts of the Bible, only a few steps
are listed. That is why it is a puzzle to fit them all together.) That Psalm 19 order comes closest to matching 
the Reformed sequence, but when you compare the two, one item is out of place. I am putting my money on Psalm 19.
(See the chapter "Psalm 19: The Glory of God's Law" for the analysis.)

What about sanctification? What must you teach a new convert to bring them to full maturity in the faith?
Better yet, do you know if you know all that **you** should know to consider yourself fully mature?
Where is the checklist? Years of reading Christian books, hearing sermons, attending seminars and classes, 
studying the Bible, and putting it into practice always and only gave me a single expectation.
The Bible has all the answers, but leave it to the experts to mine it for silver and gold and package it
for you in a best seller.

The experts must have overlooked Solomon - and Paul.

As I saw the pieces of Lady Wisdom's house start to assemble before my mind, interlocking perfectly,
I saw where Paul's letters should fit - as the roof of peace - but I saw little structure to them. 
The letters to Timothy were my first break. They were structured both by the commandments (the Law Pattern) 
and by the Growth Pattern. What of the other letters? I had no clue, until that recent evening when I
was lying on the couch, coughing and wheezing. Without a Bible or pen and paper in front of me,
in the dark, feeling miserable, it all became so clear. It can't have been my doing; it must
have been another gift.

The structure was so simple that I never would have thought of it. Sure, I spotted the Growth Pattern
in Matthew's Gospel, but that was a single document written by a single hand who set it all in order.
Paul's letters were partly collaborative, being dictated to a scribe, and they were written over the 
course of decades, then inserted into the Bible in order by descending length. By length? How random! 
There was no reason to expect that the current order was THE intended order. 
It was too easy, too perfect. Surely if the first seven letters of Paul were set in their current order 
on purpose to follow a special pattern, someone besides me would have noticed it before now!

Spiritual growth. Sanctification is all about growing up to the measure and stature of Christ.
Naturally, theologians look to the gospels and Paul's letters for the details, as they should.
I got lost in those details for years. So many topics are covered in Paul's letters. Teasing the signal 
out of the noise is hard. That is where Solomon is necessary. He tells us almost nothing BUT
the structure. He omits the content and lists the steps in his twenty-eight times. 
Only by laying out his times, by fours, and matching them to Paul's letters can you at last see
the beauty and simplicity of what Solomon, Paul and the Holy Spirit have done.

# A Course for Disciples

To gain a basic grasp of all the steps in the process of sanctification, all you have to do
is read Paul's first seven letters in the order they appear in most Bibles:

  - Romans
  - 1 Corinthians
  - 2 Corinthians
  - Galatians
  - Ephesians
  - Philippians
  - Colossians
  
Those letters are your basic discipleship class. Solomon created the course syllabus and
Paul wrote the lecture materials. There are seven stages of growth. Since Solomon was
the wisest man who ever lived (besides Jesus), we know he didn't miss any steps.
This course of study it therefore objectively complete, lacking nothing.

Since spiritual truths are difficult to master, every step has supplemental material 
to aid in comprehension and mastery:

  - **Emotional Support**. Each phase is supported by a matching psalm, to help the student find emotional strength to breakthrough.
  - **Grief Counseling**. Each phase is supported by a matching chapter from Job, to help the student overcome past traumas that impair progress as well as build an ethical core.
  - **Career Counseling**. Each phase is supported by a matching chapter from Proverbs, to help supply motivation and advice on surviving in the marketplace.
  - **Relationship Counseling**. Each phase is supported by a passage from the Song of Songs to help with the loneliness and confusion of not understanding the proper timing in dating and romance.
  - **Life Coaching**. Each phase is supported by a passage in Ecclesiastes on how to plan for the big picture.
  - **Spiritual Mentoring**. Each phase is supported by a chapter in Matthew where the Savior of the universe has words of wisdom and comfort to impart.
  - **Crisis Management**. Every phase is supported by a section in Revelation with advice on how to overcome the worst crises imaginable.

The above correspondences are described in detail in my books, but summarized in a table in [There is a Season](./there-is-a-season.html). The rest of this article will supply the proof that Paul's letters really do
conform to the Growth Pattern.

## Romans: From Earthly Security to Eternal Security

The Apostle Paul speaks of peace more than any other Bible writer. It is the final step in both the
Growth and Harvest Patterns, the pinnacle and roof of Lady Wisdom's house.
He declares this overarching theme for all his writings with his first blessed greeting:

#### To all those in Rome who are loved by God 
#### and called to be saints:
##### Grace to you and **peace** from God our Father 
##### and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### - Romans 1:7

Paul then plunges into the legal case against mankind, declaring that all people, Jew and Gentile alike, 
are under God's wrath, because lacking faith, they prove by their actions that the peace of God is not in them:

#### “Their feet are swift to shed blood;
##### in their paths are ruin and misery,
##### and **the way of peace they have not known**.”
###### - Romans 3:15-17

Then he declares the good news, that we can be saved from God's wrath, being justified by faith in Jesus Christ, 
and so find peace:

#### Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, 
#### we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
#### Through him we have also obtained access by faith 
#### into this grace in which we stand, 
#### and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
###### - Romans 5:1-2

In Solomon's list of times, the first life phase of Security includes the times to be born, to die, to be planted,
and to be uprooted. In Romans, the first two times, birth and death, are monumental. 
While every human selfishly clings to their own life as though it was the most important thing in the universe,
Paul declares that what saves our life is Christ's death, and what reconciles us to God in peace is Christ's
resurrected life:

#### For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God 
#### by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, 
#### shall we be saved by his life.
###### - Romans 5:10

He then reiterates the strong connection between Christ's death and resurrection and our dying to self 
and being reborn, via the mechanism of baptism:

#### Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized 
#### into Christ Jesus were baptized into his **death**? 
#### We were buried therefore with him by baptism into **death**, 
#### in order that, just as Christ was **raised from the dead** 
#### by the glory of the Father, we too might **walk in newness of life**.
#### For if we have been united with him in a **death** like his, 
#### we shall certainly be united with him in a **resurrection** like his. 
###### - Romans 6:3-5

This dying to self and being raised to life in Christ is the taking on of a new identity.
It is such a wonder when new Christians learn that they are 
*"set free from sin, \[and\] have become slaves of righteousness."* as it says in Romans 6:18.
This is one of Paul's most important teachings, one which revolutionized my life when taught 
to me by Pastor David Hill Sr in a seminar many years ago.

After this marvelous revelation, Paul proceeds to tackle the heart of the matter and the
defining quality of this phase in Solomon's Growth pattern, the eternal security of the believer.
In Romans 7, Paul addresses the problem that sin remains at work in the believer and must be
opposed for the rest of our earthly life. He admits that this internal war in his flesh between his
good desires and his weak character is disheartening and almost persuades him that he
has lost his salvation, until a blessed though rallies his spirit:

#### So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, 
#### evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, 
#### in my inner being, but I see in my members another law 
#### waging war against the law of my mind and making me 
#### captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. 
#### Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from 
#### this body of death? 
#### **Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!**
#### So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, 
#### but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
###### - Romans 7:21-25

Jesus will prevail! Thus nothing inside us can destroy the security that we have in Jesus.
Then what about external forces? Are there Satanic or political or natural forces that can
overthrow the faith of the believer and tear from them this blessed assurance?
In Romans 8, Paul answers with a resounding, "No!"

#### What then shall we say to these things? 
#### If God is for us, who can be against us? 
##### He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up 
##### for us all, how will he not also with him 
##### graciously give us all things? 
#### Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? 
##### It is God who justifies. 
#### Who is to condemn? 
##### Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, 
##### who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, 
##### who indeed is interceding for us.
#### Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 
##### Shall tribulation, 
##### or distress, 
##### or persecution, 
##### or famine, 
##### or nakedness, 
##### or danger, 
##### or sword? 
#### As it is written,
##### “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;
##### we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
#### No, in all these things we are more than conquerors 
#### through him who loved us. For I am sure that 
##### neither death nor life, 
##### nor angels nor rulers, 
##### nor things present nor things to come, 
##### nor powers, nor height nor depth, 
##### nor anything else in all creation, 
##### will be able to separate us from 
##### the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
###### - Romans 8:31-39

If any book in the Bible declares the doctrine of eternal security, 
it is this one.

If being born and dying are about our identity, then being planted and uprooted are 
about our relationships and our community. In Romans 11, Paul speaks at length about
how the Jews in unbelief were cut from the natural olive tree (Israel) so that new 
branches might be grafted in (the Gentile believers). Yet he holds out hope that
they might be grafted back in and cautions humility, lest by pride a believer
offend God and be cut out. Cutting and grafting are direct analogies to 
plucking and planting. Our shelter is not a house but the Church, and our
food is not meat and potatoes but the wine and bread of communion.

The surface meaning of Solomon's times is the growth of an individual from infancy to 
full maturity, the maturing of our earthly bodies. Paul in Romans 12 then 
applies this metaphor to the Church as the body of Christ.

#### For as in one body we have many members,
#### and the members do not all have the same function,
#### so we, though many, are one body in Christ, 
#### and individually members one of another. 
###### - Romans 12

Taking all this together, Romans, though it covers may topics, devotes
the core of the argument to addressing the security of believers
in their individual salvation and incorporation into the body of Christ.
The apostle does this as one of his exhortations that the gospel given to 
him leads ultimately to a life of peace with God, eternally.
