title: Which Ten Commandments?
---
## Abstract

The material in this article first appeared as the chapter "Which Ten Commandments?" in the book 
*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. It defines the Law Pattern. This pattern shows that the Ten Commandments 
are structured according to the Trinity and reveals that the Word of God is both divine and human, 
eternal and living in time. The article also shows how the Law Pattern connects thematically to
the Harvest Pattern of Jesus and the Growth Pattern of Solomon.

## Which Ten Commandments?

We could leave it there with commandment and judgment, but my books have an
awkward habit of upending my ideas as I write their conclusions. Everything in this essay
depends upon the Ten Commandments appearing in the order I said with ideas grouped
the way I grouped them. As it turns out, Jews, Catholics & Lutherans, and the Orthodox &
Reformed traditions parse the commandments three different ways. All have ten and all
the commandments are still there, but the dividing lines between where one stops and the
next starts vary. The prophetic structure proposed in these chapters only matches one of
them (the Orthodox & Reformed), though it can be reinterpreted to allow the Jewish
division without doing great injury to the theory.

Let’s roll up our sleeves and see what can be made of this wrinkle. Note that the version
adopted by the Catholic Church and inherited by the Lutherans derives from the work of
Saint Augustine. The chart on the next page derives from an article by James Akin. 
(See Akin's article here: [“The Division of the Ten Commandments”](https://www.ewtn.com/catholicism/library/division-of-the-ten-commandments-1099) )

The Augustinian approach combines the prohibition against worshiping other gods with
the prohibition against idols. The argument is that people of that day who worshiped
other gods always worshiped idols, too, so there is no need to separate them. Today we
have philosophical polytheists who eschew idols, but then there were no such people.
Augustine then split coveting in two. One defense of this is that coveting goods parallels
stealing, while coveting someone’s wife parallels adultery. This is logical, but breaks the
prophetic pattern. By moving “thou shalt not kill” into fifth position, it no longer
matches the plague of boils and the Black Plague. Other correspondences are also broken.
