title: 2 is for Jesus
---

The number two points to Jesus Christ. He is called the Word of God, and it was given in two parts, the Old and New Testaments. 

The first word in the Old Testament begins with the Hebrew letter bet - ב, which has the numerical value of two.

Jesus possesses two natures, divine and human, and as a man, shall visit this world twice. Already he has come once, riding the colt of a donkey, with open arms to proclaim forgiveness and offer peace to mankind. The second time he comes, his hands will not be empty. Riding a warhorse, he will wield a sword and execute judgment.

Psalm 2 focuses on Jesus, calling him the anointed and begotten son:

#### <sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rage
#####    and the peoples plot in vain?
#### 2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
#####    and the rulers take counsel together,
######    against the Lord and against **his Anointed**, saying,
#### 3 “Let us burst their bonds apart
#####    and cast away their cords from us.”

#### 4 He who sits in the heavens laughs;
#####    the Lord holds them in derision.
#### 5 Then he will speak to them in his wrath,
#####    and terrify them in his fury, saying,
#### 6 “As for me, I have set my King
#####    on Zion, my holy hill.”

#### 7 I will tell of the decree:
#####    The Lord said to me, “You are **my Son**;
######    today I have **begotten you**.
#### 8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,
#####    and the ends of the earth your possession.
#### 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron
#####    and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”

#### 10 Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
#####    be warned, O rulers of the earth.
#### 11 Serve the Lord with fear,
#####    and rejoice with trembling.
#### 12 **Kiss the Son**,
#####    lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
######    for his wrath is quickly kindled.
#### Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

In the Gospels, we hear of two people who "kiss the son":

  - Mary of Bethany anointed Jesus' feet with oil, dried them with her hair and kissed his feet in loving gratitude because he forgave her sins.
  - Judas Iscariot kissed Jesus to let the soldiers know whom to arrest, a kiss of betrayal.

How prophetic were the Psalmist's words!
