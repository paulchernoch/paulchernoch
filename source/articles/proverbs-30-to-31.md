This article was originally published as a portion of "Appendix E: The Plan of Proverbs",
in *Peace, Like Solomon Never Knew*. It covers chapters thirty and thirty-one of Proverbs.

## Proverbs 30. 2160-2280 AD. *A time for war*

The commentary on Proverbs 30 is found in this article in the Riddles section:

[Riddles of War](./riddles-of-war.html)

When it comes to prophecy, Proverbs 30 is among the most important in Proverbs.

## Proverbs 31. 2280 AD–?. *A time for peace*

If chapter thirty was a manual on war, this is a treatise on
peace. It is best read for spiritual – not prophetic – insight. The
wife of noble character sketched here is the church, at last fully
mature, but doubles as an announcement that women will now
be fully free, productive and respected for what they do.

#### She rises while it is yet night
##### and provides food for her household
###### and portions for her maidens.
#### She considers a field and buys it;
##### with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
#### She dresses herself with strength
##### and makes her arms strong.
#### She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
##### Her lamp does not go out at night.
###### - Proverbs 31:15-18

Surely this chapter connects to Matthew’s parables of the Ten
Virgins and Workers in the Vineyard. It references “night”
meaning the very end of the age. “Portions for her maidens”
means that the women of the church will be respected and well-
provisioned for their service. This woman is one of the prepared
virgins, for “her lamp does not go out at night”. At least part of
the church will be prepared, right up until the end.
Look at this chapter and you will see Solomon’s times – but
only the good times.

  - A time to be born: Son of my womb (31:2)
  - A time to plant: She plants a vineyard (31:16)
  - A time to heal: Kindness is on her tongue (31:26)
  - A time to build: She considers a field and buys it (31:16)
  - A time to laugh: She laughs at the time to come (31:25)
  - A time to dance: She dresses herself with strength (31:17)
  - A time to gather: She brings her food from afar (31:14)
  - A time to embrace: Her husband… praises her (31:28)
  - A time to search: She seeks wool and flax (31:13)
  - A time to keep: The heart of her husband trusts in her (31:11)
  - A time to mend: All her household are clothed in scarlet (31:21)
  - A time to speak: She opens her mouth with wisdom (31:26)
  - A time to love: Every verse is filled with love…
  - A time for peace: Give her of the fruit of her hands (31:31)

All I can say about this chapter is: I can hardly wait. I long to
see those days. I long to live in peace.

## Conclusion

In 1988, I disciplined my heart to “Get wisdom.” That was
my New Years Resolution. For six months I spent all my
devotional time reading and praying through Proverbs,
pleading with God to make me wise. The second half of the
year I did the same to Job, Ecclesiastes, Psalms and James.
Why did I plead with God to make me wise? I knew I was a
fool. The reason I knew I was a fool was that my father was
endlessly telling me not to be a fool as I was a kid growing
up. I finally listened. My dad left this life last week (January, 2022). If not for
him, I would not have fixated on the Wisdom books when I
became a Christian and would not have learned the many
things set down in this volume. Thank you, daddy, for telling
it straight.

#### Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
##### he will give delight to your heart.
###### - Proverbs 29:17, ESV

#### A wise son hears his father's instruction,
##### but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
###### - Proverbs 13:1, ESV

Rest in Peace, daddy. I listened, and am listening still.
