title: Hannah's Song
quote: For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, <br/> and on them he has set the world. <br/> - Hannah, prophetess and mother

Note: This article both summarizes and amplifies ideas first expressed in the chapter "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. That is the final chapter and 
thus concludes in setting forth the most important ideas in that book. I consider discovering the 
meaning behind the words of the Prophetess Hannah to be one of the most important revelations to 
spring from all my years of studying the Bible. Of all the words in the Bible touching on the 
subject of God's wisdom, hers may be the most profound.

## One Wise Woman

Everyone wants to be the greatest. Yet how can you become the greatest at something unless 
you know who holds the current title? That is why we keep lists. The Guinness Book of World Records
is the bible for people of ambition. The Holy Bible tells us that Solomon was the wisest man who every lived (besides Jesus, according to Matthew 12:42). Good luck beating him out!

Isn't it curious that the Bible never tells us who was the wisest woman of all time? 
We have the words of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs, but she is not a real person (or so we think). 
She could be one of the Seven Spirits of God given in Isaiah 11:2, but that either makes her an angel or a facet of the Holy Spirit. 

If we could call up Solomon, would he know? Oh dear...

#### Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, 
#### while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things— 
#### which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. 
#### One man among a thousand I found, 
##### **but a woman among all these I have not found**.
###### - Ecclesiastes 7:27-28

Solomon couldn't find ANY wise women! 

Can we do better? First, we need to have a way to measure her wisdom. 
Let's assess what was unique in the contributions given by several wise men,
then see if any women come close in offering anything comparable.

From my study of Ecclesiastes, I discovered a seven-part Growth Pattern.
This pattern of Solomon's, distilled from the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3, 
describes the phases of life that all people go through from birth to maturity. It also speaks prophetically about the rise and fall of civilizations. Pretty cool, eh? (See *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* for details, or elsewhere on this website for a summary.)

From my study of Matthew and Job, I discovered a seven-part Harvest Pattern, taught by Jesus
through his parables. It teaches us how to overcome obstacles and reap a spiritual harvest.
It also has prophetic ramifications and governs the order of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

While not the wisest, Moses was very wise. He gave us the Ten Commandments.
In *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I showed how the plagues and commandments define the structure
for God's acts of judgment against a series of world empires. They also prophesy the cadence
of God's judgments against Israel and the Church. Furthermore, those commandments govern the
organization of material in the Gospel of Matthew. (See the chapter "Matthew and the Law of Christ"
in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* for evidence to support this, as well as the following assertion.) Lastly, the Growth and Harvest Patterns each fit within the commandments, snug as a bug in a rug. 

Collectively, Moses, Solomon and Jesus gave us the principal prophetic patterns that frame 
Lady Wisdom's House. Is there a lady out there who is in their league?

Yes!

Her name is Hannah.

## A Woman of Sacrifice

Hannah was not on my radar until shortly after I discovered the Pillars of Wisdom. 
I was seeking additional supporting evidence to bolster my claims. Thus I searched the Bible for
every mention of the word pillar to see if they had anything to add or subtract from my ideas.
This led me to Hannah. Her short prayer of ten verses is uplifting, indicates great faith, but
never conveyed to me the ring of significance and gravitas that I found in an Isaiah or Jeremiah.

Truth be told, I never appreciated how wise Solomon was until after years spent deciphering his words.
I knew of Solomon's wisdom by reputation, not by experience. My conclusion was humbling:

**You cannot appreciate how wise someone is unless you possess like wisdom.**

Though I am not as wise as Solomon, I am now much wiser than I was when I was younger.
As my wisdom has grown, so too has my estimation of how great and subtle are the words of that king.
This is no different from my attitude towards Hannah. She appears in only two chapters, 1 Samuel 1-2.

In the first chapter, we learn that Hannah, like Job, suffers a sovereign affliction. It says that
the Lord had closed her womb. Like Job, she also endured scorn for her condition, from her 
husband's other wife. The distress that this caused could have embittered her, destroyed her faith
and made her lash out. Instead, by her suffering her true self was revealed and perfected. 
She prayed. She fasted. She wept before the Lord. She offered a double sacrifice. Then she made a vow.

#### And she vowed a vow and said, 
##### “O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed 
##### **look on** the affliction of your servant 
##### and **remember** me 
##### and **not forget** your servant, 
##### but will give to your servant a son, 
##### then I will give him to the Lord 
##### all the days of his life, 
##### and no razor shall touch his head.”
###### - 1 Samuel 1:11

Can you imagine a powerless woman going up to her husband and saying that she has
just made a unilateral decision. She is going to become a surrogate mother, 
give the baby up shortly after it is born, and not be paid a cent?
That is what Hannah was promising God. Abraham was asked to offer up his son Isaac in sacrifice, 
but at the last minute was given a ram to exchange for the life of his son. 
Hannah actually gave away her firstborn son. In my book, her faith was every bit as great as
that of Abraham's.

In her prayer, Hannah, like Job, longs to be heard by God. In *Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*, I catalogued the many ways that a person can communicate with God
or God talk back in response. Two powerful ways are suffering and sacrifice.
**Suffering** is one way that God communicates great wisdom to us, but it only works if you
retain your faith; only by faith can you hear what God is saying. **Sacrifice** is one way that we speak to God. It demonstrates our loyalty, resolve and sincerity.

Hannah went above and beyond. I would not have understood this about Hannah had I not had my own
miraculous experience of healing with God. Just as God sealed up Hannah's womb,
He took away all hearing in my left ear for a month in 2005. He led me to read Exodus 4,
where it says that God makes people deaf. Once I realized that it was God's will that I be deaf
in that ear (and possibly lose hearing in my other ear), what did I do? 

I trusted God. I believed that He had a good plan for me, whether to heal me or not.
Sitting in the doctor's office, I felt peace. My body was damaged but I left that office 
with a heart that was whole. In an act of surrender, I also stopped praying for God to heal me.

Two days later my hearing returned. Compare this to Hannah's story:

#### Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, 
#### and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be 
#### a drunken woman. And Eli said to her, 
##### “How long will you go on being drunk? 
##### Put your wine away from you.” 
#### But Hannah answered, 
##### “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. 
##### I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, 
##### but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. 
##### Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, 
##### for all along I have been speaking out of my 
##### great anxiety and vexation.” 
#### Then Eli answered, 
##### “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition 
##### that you have made to him.” 
#### And she said, 
##### “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” 
#### **Then the woman went her way and ate,** 
#### **and her face was no longer sad.**
###### - 1 Samuel 1:13-18

Without dream or vision, angelic visit, miracle or theophany, Hannah believed.
She ended her fast and was no longer sad. She walked away from Shiloh
with the same peace that I had when I left my doctor's office.
That is the measure of Hannah's faith.

## A Woman of Power

When a person endures great suffering and yet holds fast to God in faith, 
they receive a power from on high that can transform the people around them.
I first learned this lesson from Janet Sullivan, a member of our church who 
suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. I visited her at her nursing facility
in Somerville, MA. I have never seen someone in such physical pain. 
Mere months away from death, she held fast to her faith. Right up until the end, 
she bore witness to Jesus Christ when friends and family visited her. 
All she asked of me when I visited was that I read to her from the Bible. 
Like Job, God's words were more precious to her than anything else in this world. 
After I left her place the first time, I was overcome with weeping. 
I have never cried so hard as I did for that poor woman. 

But she was not poor! A half hour after I left her, as I walked over the BU Bridge
near my church, joy flooded my soul. It remained for a whole week.
At her funeral, one of her friends said something with which we all agreed.
"When you were with Janet, it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."

The day I met Janet Sullivan, I was delivered from ten years of depression.
A suffering, faithful Christian is like a broken jar of perfume; they fill the
whole house with their aroma. It was this insight, learned by Janet's example,
that unlocked a huge part of the book of Job for me. It solved the mystery
of whether Elihu spoke for God or himself. You see Job was another broken jar 
of perfume. The Holy Spirit poured out of him and into Elihu, enabling him to
prophecy the truths that would comfort Job.

#### For I am full of words;
##### **the spirit within me constrains me**.
#### Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;
##### **like new wineskins ready to burst**.
#### I must speak, that I may find relief;
##### I must open my lips and answer.
###### - Job 32:18-20

Can't you just feel the power of the Holy Spirit stirring within him, 
impossible to be contained? That is the power that flows out of the
suffering but faithful soul. And what power did the Lord grant Job in the end?
As near as I can tell, Job was the first person in history to whom God
gave the authority and power to forgive sins. On top of that, Job's 
book is believed to be older than Genesis, the first book of the Bible to be 
written. All that God gave to Job.

With all that as background, what did God give Hannah?

For one, he gave her the wisdom to raise a righteous son.
After Samuel was weaned, she delivered him into the care of Eli to live at the 
temple in Shiloh. What kind of a father was Eli? God took the lives of his 
two sons because they were selfish and profane, disgracing the office of 
priest entrusted to them. Any good character that Samuel learned, he learned 
from his mother Hannah. To the Jews of that time, a child may be weaned anywhere
from age two to five. So Hannah had Samuel for no more than five years.
So great was her love and example of faith that her influence remained with
him the rest of his life.

Lady Wisdom says in Proverbs, "By me kings reign." Samuel would anoint first Saul 
and then David to the kingship. Without Hannah's faith and sacrifice, there would be
no prophet Samuel.

After Hannah gave away her son, she could have mourned her loss the rest of her days.
She could have retreated into melancholy, regretting her decision.
Instead she uttered ten verses so profound, I doubt I will ever plumb their depths
of profundity and power...

## A Woman of Prophecy

In the verses that follow, I have added section headings.
There is a story behind the words that I chose, which we shall get to soon.
In what follows, Hannah speaks of seven reversals, of a world turned upside down.
What few realize is that it is her words of power that changed the world.
They are God's words and God's power, but he gave them to her and she made them her own.
After you read them, I will explain how these words take the kernels of wisdom
from Moses, Solomon and Jesus and weave them into a single fabric.
That means that Hannah spoke out words whose wisdom equals the sum of the wisdom
of those three men's words.

That makes Hannah one of the two wisest women who ever lived. 
(Have I hooked you yet?)
