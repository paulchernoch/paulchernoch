## One Wise Woman

Everyone wants to be the greatest. Yet how can you become the greatest at something unless 
you know who holds the current title? That is why we keep lists. The Guinness Book of World Records
is the bible for people of ambition. The Holy Bible tells us that Solomon was the wisest man who every lived (besides Jesus, according to Matthew 12:42). Good luck beating him out!

Isn't it curious that the Bible never tells us who was the wisest woman of all time? 
We have the words of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs, but she is not a real person (or so we think). 
She could be one of the Seven Spirits of God given in Isaiah 11:2, but that either makes her an angel or a facet of the Holy Spirit. 

If we could call up Solomon, would he know? Oh dear...

#### Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, 
#### while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things— 
#### which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. 
#### One man among a thousand I found, 
##### but a woman among all these I have not found.
###### - Ecclesiastes 7:27-28

Solomon couldn't find ANY wise women! 

Can we do better? First, we need to have a way to measure her wisdom. 
Let's assess what was unique in the contributions given by several wise men,
then see if any women come close in offering anything comparable.

From my study of Ecclesiastes, I discovered a seven-part Growth Pattern.
This pattern of Solomon's describes the phases of life that all people go through 
from birth to maturity. It also speaks prophetically about the rise and fall of civilizations. 
Pretty cool, eh? (See *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* for details, or elsewhere on this website for a summary.)

From my study of Matthew and Job, I discovered a seven-part Harvest Pattern, taught by Jesus
through his parables. It teaches us how to overcome obstacles and reap a spiritual harvest.
It also has prophetic ramifications and governs the order of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

While not the wisest, Moses was very wise. He gave us the Ten Commandments.
In *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I showed how the plagues and commandments define the structure
for God's acts of judgment against a series of world empires. They also prophesied the cadence
of God's judgments against Israel and the Church. Furthermore, those commandments govern the 
organization of material in the Gospel of Matthew. Lastly, the Growth and Harvest Patterns each
fit within the commandments, snug as a bug in a rug.

Collectively, Moses, Solomon and Jesus gave us the principal prophetic patterns that frame 
Lady Wisdom's House. Is there a lady out there who is in their league?

Yes!

Her name is Hannah.

**Introduction**

#### <sup>1</sup> And Hannah prayed and said,

#### “My heart exults in the Lord;
##### my horn is exalted in the Lord.
#### My mouth derides my enemies,
##### because I rejoice in your salvation.

#### <sup>2</sup> “There is none holy like the Lord:
##### for there is none besides you;
##### there is no rock like our God.
#### <sup>3</sup> Talk no more so very proudly,
##### let not arrogance come from your mouth;
#### for the Lord is a God of knowledge,
##### and by him actions are weighed.

**First Reversal: Security & Preparation**

#### <sup>4</sup> The bows of the mighty are broken,
##### but the feeble bind on strength.

**Second Reversal: Ability & Plowing**

#### <sup>5</sup> Those who were full 
##### have hired themselves out for bread,
#### but those who were hungry 
##### have ceased to hunger.

**Third Reversal: Stability & Planting**

#### **The barren has borne seven**,
##### but she who has many children is forlorn.

**Fourth Reversal: Amity & Pouring**

#### <sup>6</sup> The Lord kills and brings to life;
##### he brings down to Sheol and raises up.

**Fifth Reversal: Opportunity & Plucking**

#### <sup>7</sup> The Lord makes poor and makes rich;
##### he brings low and he exalts.

**Sixth Reversal: Community & Producing a Harvest**

#### <sup>8</sup> He raises up the poor from the dust;
##### he lifts the needy from the ash heap
#### to make them sit with princes
##### and inherit a seat of honor.

**Interlude**

#### For **the pillars of the earth** are the Lord's,
##### and on them he has set the world.

**Seventh Reversal (a chiasm): Loyalty & Peace**

#### <sup>9</sup> “He will guard the feet of his faithful ones,
##### but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness,
##### for not by might shall a man prevail.
#### <sup>10</sup> The adversaries of the Lord 
##### shall be broken to pieces;
###### against them he will thunder in heaven.
#### The Lord will judge the ends of the earth;
##### he will give strength to his king
###### and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
