title: Hannah's Song
quote: For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, <br/> and on them he has set the world. <br/> - Hannah, prophetess and mother
---
Note: This article both summarizes and amplifies ideas first expressed in the chapter 
"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. That is the final chapter and 
thus concludes in setting forth the most important ideas in that book. I consider discovering the 
meaning behind the words of the Prophetess Hannah to be one of the most important revelations to 
spring from all my years of studying the Bible. Of all the words in the Bible touching on the 
subject of God's wisdom, hers may be the most profound.

## One Wise Woman

Everyone wants to be the greatest. Yet how can you become the greatest at something unless 
you know who holds the current title? That is why we keep lists. The Guinness Book of World Records
is the bible for people of ambition. The Holy Bible tells us that Solomon was the wisest man who every lived 
(besides Jesus, according to Matthew 12:42). Good luck beating him out!

Isn't it curious that the Bible never tells us who was the wisest woman of all time? 
We have the words of Lady Wisdom in Proverbs, but she is not a real person (or so we think). 
She could be one of the Seven Spirits of God given in Isaiah 11:2, but that either makes her an angel or a facet of the Holy Spirit. 

If we could call up Solomon, would he know? Oh dear...

#### Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, 
#### while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things— 
#### which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. 
#### One man among a thousand I found, 
##### **but a woman among all these I have not found**.
###### - Ecclesiastes 7:27-28

Solomon couldn't find ANY wise women! 

Can we do better? First, we need to have a way to measure her wisdom. 
Let's assess what was unique in the contributions given by several wise men,
then see if any women come close in offering anything comparable.

From my study of Ecclesiastes, I discovered a seven-part Growth Pattern.
This pattern of Solomon's, distilled from the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 3, 
describes the phases of life that all people go through from birth to maturity. 
It also speaks prophetically about the rise and fall of civilizations. 
Pretty cool, eh? (See *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* for details, or elsewhere on this website for a summary.)

From my study of Matthew and Job, I discovered a seven-part Harvest Pattern, taught by Jesus
through his parables. It teaches us how to overcome obstacles and reap a spiritual harvest.
It also has prophetic ramifications and governs the order of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

While not the wisest, Moses was very wise. He gave us the Ten Commandments.
In *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I showed how the plagues and commandments define the structure
for God's acts of judgment against a series of world empires. They also prophesy the cadence
of God's judgments against Israel and the Church. Furthermore, those commandments govern the
organization of material in the Gospel of Matthew. (See the chapter "Matthew and the Law of Christ"
in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* for evidence to support this, as well as the following assertion.) 
Lastly, the Growth and Harvest Patterns each fit within the commandments, snug as a bug in a rug. 

Collectively, Moses, Solomon and Jesus gave us the principal prophetic patterns that frame 
Lady Wisdom's House. Is there a lady out there who is in their league?

Yes!

Her name is Hannah.

## A Woman of Sacrifice

Hannah was not on my radar until shortly after I discovered the Pillars of Wisdom. 
I was seeking additional supporting evidence to bolster my claims. Thus I searched the Bible for
every mention of the word pillar to see if they had anything to add or subtract from my ideas.
This led me to Hannah. Her short prayer of ten verses is uplifting, indicates great faith, but
never conveyed to me the ring of significance and gravitas that I found in an Isaiah or Jeremiah.

Truth be told, I never appreciated how wise Solomon was until after years spent deciphering his words.
I knew of Solomon's wisdom by reputation, not by experience. My conclusion was humbling:

**You cannot appreciate how wise someone is unless you possess like wisdom.**

Though I am not as wise as Solomon, I am now much wiser than I was when I was younger.
As my wisdom has grown, so too has my estimation of how great and subtle are the words of that king.
This is no different from my attitude towards Hannah. She appears in only two chapters, 1 Samuel 1-2.

In the first chapter, we learn that Hannah, like Job, suffers a sovereign affliction. It says that
the Lord had closed her womb. Like Job, she also endured scorn for her condition, from her 
husband's other wife. The distress that this caused could have embittered her, destroyed her faith
and made her lash out. Instead, by her suffering her true self was revealed and perfected. 
She prayed. She fasted. She wept before the Lord. She offered a double sacrifice. Then she made a vow.

#### And she vowed a vow and said, 
##### “O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed 
##### **look on** the affliction of your servant 
##### and **remember** me 
##### and **not forget** your servant, 
##### but will give to your servant a son, 
##### then I will give him to the Lord 
##### all the days of his life, 
##### and no razor shall touch his head.”
###### - 1 Samuel 1:11

Can you imagine a powerless woman going up to her husband and saying that she has
just made a unilateral decision. She is going to become a surrogate mother, 
give the baby up shortly after it is born, and not be paid a cent?
That is what Hannah was promising God. Abraham was asked to offer up his son Isaac in sacrifice, 
but at the last minute was given a ram to exchange for the life of his son. 
Hannah actually gave away her firstborn son. In my book, her faith was every bit as great as
that of Abraham's.

In her prayer, Hannah, like Job, longs to be heard by God. In *Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*, I catalogued the many ways that a person can communicate with God
or God talk back in response. Two powerful ways are suffering and sacrifice.
**Suffering** is one way that God communicates great wisdom to us, but it only works if you
retain your faith; only by faith can you hear what God is saying. **Sacrifice** is one way that we speak to God. It demonstrates our loyalty, resolve and sincerity.

Hannah went above and beyond. I would not have understood this about Hannah had I not had my own
miraculous experience of healing with God. Just as God sealed up Hannah's womb,
He took away all hearing in my left ear for a month in 2005. He led me to read Exodus 4,
where it says that God makes people deaf. Once I realized that it was God's will that I be deaf
in that ear (and possibly lose hearing in my other ear), what did I do? 

I trusted God. I believed that He had a good plan for me, whether to heal me or not.
Sitting in the doctor's office, I felt peace. My body was damaged but I left that office 
with a heart that was whole. In an act of surrender, I also stopped praying for God to heal me.

Two days later my hearing returned. Compare this to Hannah's story:

#### Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, 
#### and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be 
#### a drunken woman. And Eli said to her, 
##### “How long will you go on being drunk? 
##### Put your wine away from you.” 
#### But Hannah answered, 
##### “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. 
##### I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, 
##### but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord. 
##### Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, 
##### for all along I have been speaking out of my 
##### great anxiety and vexation.” 
#### Then Eli answered, 
##### “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition 
##### that you have made to him.” 
#### And she said, 
##### “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” 
#### **Then the woman went her way and ate,** 
#### **and her face was no longer sad.**
###### - 1 Samuel 1:13-18

Without dream or vision, angelic visit, miracle or theophany, Hannah believed.
She ended her fast and was no longer sad. She walked away from Shiloh
with the same peace that I had when I left my doctor's office.
That is the measure of Hannah's faith.

## A Woman of Power

When a person endures great suffering and yet holds fast to God in faith, 
they receive a power from on high that can transform the people around them.
I first learned this lesson from Janet Sullivan, a member of our church who 
suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. I visited her at her nursing facility
in Somerville, MA. I have never seen someone in such physical pain. 
Mere months away from death, she held fast to her faith. Right up until the end, 
she bore witness to Jesus Christ when friends and family visited her. 
All she asked of me when I visited was that I read to her from the Bible. 
Like Job, God's words were more precious to her than anything else in this world. 
After I left her place the first time, I was overcome with weeping. 
I have never cried so hard as I did for that poor woman. 

But she was not poor! A half hour after I left her, as I walked over the BU Bridge
near my church, joy flooded my soul. It remained for a whole week.
At her funeral, one of her friends said something with which we all agreed.
"When you were with Janet, it was like the Holy Spirit was pouring out of her."

The day I met Janet Sullivan, I was delivered from ten years of depression.
A suffering, faithful Christian is like a broken jar of perfume; they fill the
whole house with their aroma. It was this insight, learned by Janet's example,
that unlocked a huge part of the book of Job for me. It solved the mystery
of whether Elihu spoke for God or himself. You see Job was another broken jar 
of perfume. The Holy Spirit poured out of him and into Elihu, enabling him to
prophecy the truths that would comfort Job.

#### For I am full of words;
##### **the spirit within me constrains me**.
#### Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;
##### **like new wineskins ready to burst**.
#### I must speak, that I may find relief;
##### I must open my lips and answer.
###### - Job 32:18-20

Can't you just feel the power of the Holy Spirit stirring within him, 
impossible to be contained? That is the power that flows out of the
suffering but faithful soul. And what power did the Lord grant Job in the end?
As near as I can tell, Job was the first person in history to whom God
gave the authority and power to forgive sins. On top of that, Job's 
book is believed to be older than Genesis, the first book of the Bible to be 
written. All that God gave to Job.

With all that as background, what did God give Hannah?

For one, he gave her the wisdom to raise a righteous son.
After Samuel was weaned, she delivered him into the care of Eli to live at the 
temple in Shiloh. What kind of a father was Eli? God took the lives of his 
two sons because they were selfish and profane, disgracing the office of 
priest entrusted to them. Any good character that Samuel learned, he learned 
from his mother Hannah. To the Jews of that time, a child may be weaned anywhere
from age two to five. So Hannah had Samuel for no more than five years.
So great was her love and example of faith that her influence remained with
him the rest of his life.

Lady Wisdom says in Proverbs, "By me kings reign." Samuel would anoint first Saul 
and then David to the kingship. Without Hannah's faith and sacrifice, there would be
no prophet Samuel.

After Hannah gave away her son, she could have mourned her loss the rest of her days.
She could have retreated into melancholy, regretting her decision.
Instead she uttered ten verses so subtle, I doubt I will ever plumb their depths
of profundity and power...

## A Woman of Prophecy

In the verses that follow, I have added section headings.
There is a story behind the words that I chose, which we shall get to soon.
In what follows, Hannah speaks of seven reversals, of a world turned upside down.
What few realize is that it is her words of power that changed the world.
They are God's words and God's power, but he gave them to her and she made them her own.
After you read them, I will explain how these words take the kernels of wisdom
from Moses, Solomon and Jesus and weave them into a single fabric.
That means that Hannah spoke out words whose wisdom equals the sum of the wisdom
of those three men's words.

That makes Hannah one of the two wisest women who ever lived. 
(Have I hooked you yet?)

**Introduction**

#### <sup>2</sup> “There is none holy like the Lord:
##### for there is none besides you;

###### - 1 Samuel 2:1-10

## The Big picture

What is the big picture? In a riddle, Hannah prophesied the existence of the seven pillars
of wisdom before six of them had been written. Her prophecy was delivered 
a century before Solomon wrote Proverbs, where they are finally named explicitly.
You don't see it?

In verse 5, we have *"The barren has borne seven."* This verse is close to the heart of Hannah.
She was "the barren" and now she is not, praise God! Seven means completeness, 
an overflowing harvest of children. From this part of Hannah's riddle we get the number seven.

We know that the second half of verse eight is significant because it breaks pattern.
It interrupts the seven reversals of fortune, falling between the sixth and the seventh.
In verse 8 we read, *"For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world."* 
From this part of Hannah's riddle we get the pillars. From Proverbs we know that it is upon
wisdom that God established the heavens and the earth. Wisdom is their foundation. 
Thus by appearing just before the seventh reversal and because of the emotional connection
of Hannah to the verse about the barren bearing seven, we have the seven pillars of wisdom.

## The Introduction

If a little wordplay was all it took to match Hannah's prayer to the seven pillars of wisdom,
her words would be curious, but not profound. The above connection that I found to the 
Seven Pillars of Wisdom is merely what drew me in. Once I made the initial connection, the
deeper meaning tumbled out. 

  - The prayer has ten verses. Each verse matches its corresponding commandment ala the Law Pattern, and in one case, matching Exodus plague. (I did not notice that concordance until I wrote this article.)
  - The seven reversals match the seven phases of the Solomon's Growth Pattern. The name of the growth phase is the first word after the colon in the label for each reversal.
  - The seven reversals also match the seven phases of Jesus' Harvest Pattern. The name of the Harvest Phase follows the ampersand in each reversal label.
  - The seven reversals also correspond to seven eras of history, each lasting 480 years, beginning with the dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem in 960 BC. They prophesy an important event in each era.

The three patterns, Harvest, Law and Growth, show up twice. First they are identified in the
introduction, then laid out in detail in the reversals (or in the case of the Law pattern, the entire prayer). 

**The Harvest.** Verse 1 says, "I rejoice in your salvation". In Matthew, Jesus is the 
Lord of the Harvest. Whether sending workers out into the harvest, or sending angels with nets,
or sending disciples out with the Great Commission, Jesus is all about bringing in a 
harvest of souls. He is the savior and this verse tells us that the savior and his
Harvest Pattern are here.

**The Law.** Verse 2 says, "There is no rock like our God." The Law is the foundation of Lady Wisdom's House, the bedrock which protects it from the storm. The Ten Commandments were 
carved upon tablets of stone. Then there are the words "there is none besides you". 
This echoes the commandment in Exodus 20:3, which says, "You shall have no other gods before me."
This tells us that the Law Pattern is here.

**Growth in Wisdom.** Verse 3 says, "for the Lord is a God of knowledge". This explicitly 
focuses us on wisdom, Solomon's specialty. 

The body of the prayer has seven reversals, signifying a struggle, even a war.
The introduction describes the combatants in three opposing pairs.

  1. The first pair of adversaries are Hannah's own heart, which is "in the Lord" and her enemies, whose hearts are not. When she says that her "horn is exalted", that brings to mind the trumpets blown to announce a charge.
  2. The second pair of adversaries are the Lord God, who is like a rock, and what? Nothing! Nothing can oppose him for there is "none holy like the Lord".
  3. The third pair of adversaries are proud, arrogant talkers on the one hand, and the "God of knowledge" on the other. The declaration "by him actions are weighed" carries us into the body of the prayer, where God's actions of exalting the weak will be compared to the actions of those who oppose him. The seven reversals are like the scales God uses to weigh all men's deeds.

I completely overlooked the introductory verses in my analysis in *Peace*. 
When solving riddles, it is not wise to overlook anything.

## Hannah Understands the Law

The weighing of actions spoken of in verse 3 speaks to the very function of Law.
Now consider its particulars. 

<hr/>

| Verse |      Commandment        |        Connection to Hannah's Prayer         |
| :---: | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 1     | No other Gods           | Hannah prays, *"My heart exults in the Lord... I rejoice in your **salvation**."* <br/> She had no place in her heart for any God but her savior. The preamble to the Ten Commandments reminded the Israelites that God brought them out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage. They had only one savior and so did Hannah. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 2     | No idols                | Hannah prays, *"There is none holy like the Lord: for there is none besides you; there is **no rock like our God**."* <br/> Pagan fools worship statues made of rock, but theirs is the wrong rock. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 3     | No vain speech          | Hannah prays, *"**talk** no more so very **proudly**, let not **arrogance** come from **your mouth**; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."* <br/> No verse of her prayer better captures its commandment than this! |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 4     | Keep the Sabbath holy   | Hannah prays, *"the bows of the mighty are broken, but **the feeble bind on strength**."* <br/> The sabbath is about entering God's rest. Rest helps you become strong and recover from the hard labors of life. God gives us the sabbath so that we may bind on strength. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 5     | Honor father & mother   | Hannah prays, *"**The barren has borne seven**, but she who has many children is forlorn."* <br/> God honored Hannah by enabling her to become a mother. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 6     | No murder               | Hannah prays, *"**The Lord kills** and brings to life; **he brings down to Sheol** and raises up."* <br/> God's punishment for murder is death, here executed without hesitation. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 7     | No adultery             | Hannah prays, *"The Lord makes poor and **makes rich**; he brings low and he **exalts**."* <br/> This says nothing about sexual sin, yet consider what Peter said. "They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!" (2 Peter 2:14) Greed is spiritual adultery. The rich in Hannah's words are committing the adultery of greed. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 8     | No theft                | Hannah prays, *"**He raises up the poor** from the dust; he **lifts the needy** from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and **inherit** a seat of honor."* <br/> How many of the needy got that way because the powerful stole from them? |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 9     | No lying                | Hannah prays, *"the wicked shall be cut off in **darkness**".* <br/> The ninth plague on Egypt was the plague of darkness. Darkness symbolizes the lies that make people stumble like they are in the dark, while light symbolizes truth that shows the way. |
| <hr/> | <hr/>                   | <hr/>                                        |
| 10    | No coveting             | Hannah prays, *"against them he will **thunder in heaven**. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth."* <br/> Where in the Bible does God thunder the most? In Exodus, Job and Revelation. This speaks of the final judgment. While covetousness is not named explicitly, Romans, Ephesians Colossians and James single out covetousness as the prototypical form of idolatry. It shows up last on many lists, indicating that it forms the core of our rebellion. |

<hr/>

When it occurred to me check whether the commandments line up with Hannah's prayer, I expected to not find a match.
A quick internet search did not turn up anyone else making this connection.
What are the odds that something so strikingly simple as this for the structure of her speech has never been seen before?
I spent hours analyzing this prayer a few years ago and never spotted it. How happy am I that God showed this to me!

What can we take away from this? Hannah firmly believed that the basis of her hope was God's law.
His law is His bond. It is His promise. She saw that law not as a set of constraints, but as the 
liberating force that it really is. Oh, how wonderful is her great cry of relief! The barren has borne seven!
How marvelous that it lines up with the command to honor your father and mother. She saw that we do not honor our
parents alone. God steps in alongside us and brings honor to parents by his love and grace. 
His grace made Hannah, whose name means grace, into a gracious mother who poured her heart into loving a son
whom she could not keep. And God still honors mothers today, just as he did Hannah long ago.

## Hannah Understands Motherhood

When you look at the whole prayer, not skipping the introduction, you also see how Hannah weaves
in the metaphor of pregnancy. Yes, she speaks of the barren woman bearing seven, but it goes 
beyond that one verse. If we look at the structure of the prayer, there are changes at these positions:

  - between the third and fourth verses we go from oppositions to reversals
  - in the middle of the eighth verse, between the sixth and seventh reversals, we have the interlude about the pillars of the earth
  - the ninth and tenth verses form the final reversal, a chiasm

We can compare this structure to the course of a pregnancy.

  - **Verse 1**: My heart exults in the Lord. Hannah is overjoyed to conceive.
  - **Verses 1-3**: The first trimester. These verses do not have reversals (like labor pains or baby movements). During this trimester, women cannot yet feel the baby move.
  - **Verses 4-5**: The second trimester (reversals one to three). Hannah says, "the feeble bind on strength". Now she feels the baby, as the quickening comes between the 16th and 25th week, but as early as the 13th week. She feels alternately happy and "forlorn" (verse 5), as it is an emotional time.
  - **Verses 6-8a**: The third trimester (reversals  four to six). Hannah says, "The Lord... brings to life."
  - **Verse 8b**: Hannah gives birth to Samuel. As a great and faithful prophet, he would grow up to be one of the "pillars of the earth", "sit with princes" and "inherit a seat of honor".
  - **Verse 9**: Hannah recovers during the post partum laying-in period. "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones" sounds like Samuel's father protecting his newborn son, even tickling his toes.
  - **Verse 10**: Samuel grows up and fulfills his destiny. First to "judge" the people. Second, to "exalt the horn of his anointed" when he anointed two kings over Israel, Saul and David. 

From this analysis, we see that Hannah has interpreted her pregnancy as giving birth to a new age for her people.
Her son would help the nation transition from a group of tribes ruled by judges to one nation ruled by a king.
This is the near term prophecy that we can see in her words. I overlooked this crucial, basic layer of meaning
when I wrote of my initial findings two years ago. The metaphor of pregnancy unifies the whole prayer, which
means that if there is a second, long-term prophecy to be found here, it must also bring in the whole prayer.

## Defining A Prophetic Clock

In *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I set forth hermeneutical rules for discovering and 
interpreting a prophetic clock. Among those principles are these. The riddles in the text should:

  - Identify the historical event that defines when the clock begins.
  - Identify how many time periods are in the clock.
  - Identify how long each time period lasts.
  - Have a unifying theme.

We have already seen that there are two unifying themes:

  - The Ten Commandments
  - The birth of a nation

The combination tells us that the new nation will be a theocracy. 

**Start Year**. What about the start year? That is where I went wrong in my previous book.
Starting with verse four, I matched prophecies correctly to history but skipped over the first three verses.
Why? Part of the pattern that I found in her prayer matches Solomon's Growth Pattern.
There was nothing in the prayer to suggest that it should start with Solomon's Temple (960 BC) or the Creation, 
so the logical place to start was with the birth of Samuel, ca 1080 BC. However, now that we see the Ten Commandments
as part of the structure, we have evidence that points to an earlier start. The more **appropriate start for the
clock is with the Exodus**, when those commandments were given.

According to my calculations, the Exodus occurred in 1447 BC. Despite my best efforts, I may be off by a few years.
To keep the numbers round and to align it with dozens of other spiritual clocks from my books, 
we shall **start this clock in 1440 BC**. 

**Number of Periods**. Clocks that use Solomon's times, depending on whether they are divided into seven, 
fourteen or twenty-eight eras, usually have periods whose duration is 480, 240 or 120 years, respectively. 
In my previous analysis, it seemed sensible to respect the peculiarity of the prayer's structure. 
It broke pattern between the sixth and seventh reversals, with the interlude that speaks of the pillars of the earth.
I concluded then that there were eight periods. If we now add in the first three verses, we will get **eleven periods**.

**Duration of Periods.** Now in Ecclesiastes, Solomon used fourteen pairs of opposites. 
Such opposites resemble the reversals in Hannah's prayer.
But because the interlude does not have a reversal, it seemed right to make it a different length of time from the rest.
If Samuel was born about 1080 BC, then if the extra period for the pillar is 120 years, not 480 years as for the 
reversals, the end of this clock would synchronize with the end of Solomon's clock.
It turns out that this extra 120 era is one of the most eventful eras in the history of the church: 
the missionary era of 1800-1920 AD, when the abolition movement began to root out slavery and 
women began to be granted more rights, including the right to own property separate from her husband (1848 AD) 
and the right to vote (1920 AD).

It fits. If we also make the first three verses into shorter periods of 120 years, they also fit.

There is a good subjective reason whey the periods that are parts of reversals last longer than the others.
Once that baby starts kicking, those months seem to drag on forever!

**Clock Definition**. To summarize, we have a prophetic clock with these broad features:

  - Starts in 1440 BC near the Exodus.
  - Has eleven periods.
  - The first three periods last 120 years each.
  - The first six reversals last 480 years each, or 240 years per each half a reversal.
  - The interlude with the pillars lasts 120 years
  - The seventh reversal lasts 480 years
  - The clock ends in 2400 AD (though the last period might be cut short by Jesus' return)

The seventh reversal is a chiasm, meaning it follows an A-B-B'-A' pattern. 
The first and last parts are about the good, while the second and third parts are about the wicked.
That means that we really have two reversals here. Instead of adding more time to the clock,
these last two verses go into greater detail about the same era.
As we shall see, the seven reversals correspond to seven quartets of times from Ecclesiastes 3.
Thus the last reversal is for the times to love, to hate, for war and for peace.
That quartet has the pattern good-bad-bad-good, just like verses 9 and 10 with their pattern of reversals.

## Hannah's Prophetic Clock

It is now time to reveal Hannah's extended prophetic clock.
The first three verses are not prophetic; they are backwards looking.
They anchor Hannah's calendar in the past, going back to the Exodus, showing that
what follows is a continuation of God's unfolding plan.

Before the clock, here is a review of the Harvest and Growth Patterns.

  - Each Harvest Phase also matches a Bible book (its corresponding Pillar book)
  - Each Harvest Phase matches one of the Seven Spirits of God named in Isaiah 11:2
  - Each Growth phase is built from four times taken from the poem in Ecclesiastes 3
  - Each Growth phase lasts seven years in a typical person's life

These patterns apply literally to individual people and figuratively to nations, the church and whole civilizations.
So just as Hannah is describing the growth of a baby within, she is also prophesying the birth and growth of our civilization.
