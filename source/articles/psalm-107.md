This article originally appeared as the chapter "Psalm 107: Where is the Love?" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
The idea that it prophesies the return of the Jews to Israel in authentic detail is not original to me; 
I heard a preacher speak about this decades ago. However, most of the remaining prophetic connections in this article 
are my own discoveries. Few Psalms are as rich in detail about God's plans for His people as Psalm 107. Enjoy!

## Where is the Love?

Sitting in the middle of the seven historical psalms is
the pivotal on107. The writer of Psalm 106
prayed that God would bring the exiles back to Israel.
This psalm is the answer to that prayer. It recounts story
after story of people rescued by God from troubles of every
kind. Each exile faced a different crisis. No two needed
rescuing in the same way, but God was up to the task. If
anyone thinks their own problems are unique and
insoluble, we worship a unique God.

In the 1970s, Roberta Flack sang a sad song titled “Where is the Love?” 
Many people look to God for love but don’t
find it. Maybe they don’t know what love is. Maybe they
give up their search too soon. Maybe they don’t want to
give up the idols competing for God’s affection. God’s love
runs like a river through this psalm. 
*“He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs...”* (107:35) 
The Holy Spirit flows in to water parched
hearts. The key to understanding its words is to look in
each section to find “where is the love”. That position
reveals times when God’s love was most potent during each era.

The rhythm of Ecclesiastes 3 hums throughout the forty-
three verses of this psalm. It is divided in seven sections,
but four are singled out for special focus by repeating this
refrain:

#### Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
##### and his wonderful deeds for mankind. 
###### - (Repeated in verses 8,15,21,31)

The number four is first introduced in verse three, which
declares that God will gather His people from east, west,
north and south. Ecclesiastes twice invoked analogies to
the cardinal directions, with the occurrence in Ecclesiastes
11 referring to God sending missionaries out to reach the
wider world, a matter touched on in this psalm. Deeper
still, every section of the poem is structured in four parts:

  - People end up in **trouble**
  - They **cry out** to God
  - God **rescues** them
  - The people **praise** Him

Seven sections of four parts each makes twenty-eight.
That correspondence with Ecclesiastes makes it
appropriate to ask: do the seven sections match the seven
stages of growth? Do they match the twenty-eight times, in
order and tell a coherent story? Let us see.

Our theory is that this psalm is a clock for the work of the
Holy Spirit. It begins in 33 AD at Pentecost and runs until
2280 AD, at the end of the era. It divides time into twenty-
eight sections but begins about a thousand years after
Solomon’s Celestial Clock (which started in 960 AD, at the
dedication of the temple). Thus the two clocks will be out
of phase at the start and assign different “times” to each
era, but gradually converge as they near the end.

The former clock was associated with the Son, the Word
of God. It touched on the actions of the church. Since the
actions of believers are open to the student of history to
see, matching such events to Ecclesiastes and other Bible
passages made sense. However, the Spirit is like the wind. It
blows where it pleases and you can’t trace its path. The
Spirit often begins a hidden work in one era which does not
manifest in identifiable historical events until the next.
With that in mind, here is the Spirit Clock.

**33–354 AD**. *Existential Security*.
Born, die, plant & uproot.

**354–675 AD**. *Functional Ability*.
Kill, heal, tear down & build.

**675–996 AD**. *Emotional Stability*.
Weep, laugh, mourn, & dance.

**996–1317 AD**. *Relational Amity*.
Scatter stones, gather, embrace & refrain.

**1317–1638 AD**. *Resource Opportunity*.
Search, give up, keep & throw away.

**1638–1959 AD**. *Community*.
Tear, mend, be silent & speak.

**1959–2280 AD**. *Loyalty*. 
Love, hate, war & peace.

## The Great Ingathering

The first section serves as a table of contents into much
of the psalm.

#### Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good;
##### his love endures forever.
#### Let the redeemed of the LORD tell their story—
##### those he **redeemed from the hand of the foe**,
##### those he **gathered** from the lands,
##### **from east and west, from north and south**.
###### - Psalm 107:1-3, NIV

Many prophecies in the Bible have a dual fulfillment. This
prophecy looks to be one of them. The first fulfillment was
the return from the Babylonian Exile and the second
fulfillment (for Israel) was the return from the diaspora
after the fall of Nazi Germany and the founding of the new
nation of Israel. However, the prophecy in this psalm has a
third meaning that pertains to the church.

When referring to Israel, the details are both poetic and
specific. These verses describe the ingathering of the Jews
in five stages and that is not only how it happened, but the
stages are given in chronological order. The odds of getting
that right by chance are one in a hundred twenty:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>120 = 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5</p>
</div>

(1) **The hand of the foe**. The foe was Adolph Hitler. The
first large group to reenter Palestine was composed of
Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis, both those who left
during the 1930s and those who were rescued from the
concentration camps at the end of the World War II.

(2) **Gathered from the East**. From the Jewish Virtual Library’s article 
[Total Immigration to Israel by Continent and Year](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/total-immigration-to-israel-by-continent-per-year), 
we have year-by-year tallies of how many
Jews emigrated to Israel. If you take the total number from
each continent and then figure out the year by which half
that total arrived cumulatively from each continent, you
can establish a quantitative order for each returning
cohort. The second cohort to arrive in Jerusalem hailed
from Asia, from the East. Half of the roughly 225,000 Jews
to emigrate from Asia had arrived by 1951. These were Jews
driven from their homes by enraged Muslim nations like
Jordan, Iraq and Iran following the restoration of Israel in
**1948**.

(3) **Gathered from the West**. The Jews of the West lived
in North Africa, in Egypt, Libya, Morocco and other Arab
nations who similarly drove out many of their Jewish
citizens following the Suez War of 1956. Of the
approximately 526,000 Jews to come from that region, half
had resettled in Israel by **1965**.

(4) **Gathered from the North**. Only some of the Jews of
Europe emigrated in the 1940s. Others remained in Europe
by choice – or in Russia and Eastern Europe by force. The
Iron Curtain imprisoned them from returning to their
ancestral homeland. After the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet
Union collapsed, huge numbers of Jews streamed back into
the land. Of the 2.3 million Jewish people to emigrate from
these lands, half had arrived by 1990, which was also the
high-water mark of the influx.

(5) **Gathered from the South**. Who are the Jews of the
South? The Hebrew for this this word also means “the sea”.
In Israel, Solomon’s key seaport was at Ezion-Geber, on the
eastern wing of the Red Sea, to the south. The Jews of the
south are those who traveled by sea to the most remote
regions of the earth: the islands and the Americas. This
screws with the math. Only 290,000 Jews have returned to
Israel from the US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.
The halfway point for that immigration was in 1969, which
comes before the halfway time for the Jews of the North.
However, America has about six million Jewish citizens, the
largest concentration outside of Israel. Their return to
Israel hasn’t happened yet. They will be the last to return.
The time of hate is on the horizon. Jews are the canaries in
the coal mine. When hateful ideologies spread across the
face of the earth, they will be among the first to suffer.

Take a moment to see what we just did. Without
theology, without numerology, without esoteric symbolism
or fanciful interpretations we crunched raw numbers based
on demographic data related to objectively verifiable
immigration patterns and proved that the Bible anticipated
them by thousands of years. How great is our God!

(For a detailed look at what Psalm 107 says about the recent history and future of Israel, 
see “Appendix C: A Time for Israel” in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.)

Now how do these verses apply to the church?

<span id="3"/>
## Power to Vanquish the Foe (33–354 AD)

The first great foe of the church was Rome. God granted
the church the emotional and spiritual power to conquer
that foe. By the time this period ended in 354 AD,
Constantine had ended state persecution of Christians and
become the first of a long line of Christian Emperors.

What of the first four times – to be born, die, planted and
uprooted? The birth was the church springing into
existence in 33 AD and the death, the destruction of the
temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD and the genocide and
scattering of the Jews following the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136
AD. The church was planted and pagan control over Rome
uprooted.

Where is the love? “His love endures forever.” Since the
word love occurs in the first verse of the section, God’s
greatest outpouring of love occurred in the beginning of
this era, on the day of Pentecost. Upon reaching the end of
the era, that love was on the move again: to the east.

<span id="4"/>
## Power to Face the East (354–675 AD)

#### Some wandered in desert wastelands,
##### finding no way to **a city where they could settle**.
#### They were hungry and thirsty,
##### and their lives ebbed away.
#### Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
##### and he delivered them from their distress.
#### He led them by a straight way
##### to **a city where they could settle**.
#### Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
##### and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
#### for he satisfies the thirsty
##### and fills the hungry with good things. 
###### - Psalm 107:4-9

In the first section, the number four was seen in the
compass directions east, west, north and south. Starting
with this section, the pattern becomes suffering (4-5),
crying to God for help (6a), God rescuing His people (6b-7),
and his people praising him (8-9).

This is the first of four consecutive sections containing the phrase 
**“Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind...”**. 
Could these four sections each match a different compass direction?

This episode shows people wandering the desert in
search of a city for protection. This period in history (354–
675 AD) was dominated by two cities, Rome and
Constantinople. The city of man was sacked twice, in 410
and 546, ending Rome’s dominance over the world of the
Mediterranean. Yet even from a position of weakness, Pope
Gregory the Great rendered assistance to refugees from the
barbarian invasions, a visible manifestation of God’s
assistance to believers seeking refuge.

In a first trial from the east, in 452 AD Pope Leo the Great
persuaded Attila the Hun to turn back and not invade Italy.

In 426 AD, Augustine wrote *The City of God*, defying the
world to overthrow the heavenly city that God would raise
up. While Constantinople was not that city, it did rise to
prominence and became Christendom’s bulwark against
the surrounding chaos. The four times – to kill, heal, tear
down & build – match this era. There was killing and
tearing down in the west, as the Western Roman Empire
fell, but healing and building up in the east, where Justinian
erected the Hagia Sophia (537). This era’s four times pertain
to growing in both physical strength and mental ability.

This was when the church grew in numbers, political and
military strength, and began to reframe philosophy and all
human knowledge with Christ at its center.

With the Western Roman Empire fallen and the Eastern
Roman Empire in ascendancy, this era does represent a
movement of the church to the east, the first of the four
compass directions in Psalm 107:3. It was therefore from
the east that the gravest threats of this period arose.

What was the most blessed time in this era? The
placement of the word “love” tells us when. “Love”
appears late in this passage, in the fifth of six verses, hence
corresponds to the mid sixth century, a time when Justinian
was able to reclaim much of the western part of the empire.
That time of grace ended with wars in the east, first against
the Sassanid Empire, which drained the vitality of each
empire, providing an opening for the Islamic conquests of
the seventh century.

<span id="5"/>
## Power to Win the West (675–996 AD)

#### Some sat in **darkness**, in utter **darkness**,
##### **prisoners** suffering in iron chains,
#### because they rebelled against God’s commands
##### and despised the plans of the Most High.
#### So he subjected them to **bitter labor**;
##### they stumbled, and there was **no one to help**.
#### Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
##### and he saved them from their distress.
#### He brought them out of **darkness**, the utter **darkness**,
##### and **broke away their chains**.
#### Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
##### and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
#### for **he breaks down gates of bronze**
##### **and cuts through bars of iron**.
###### - Psalm 107:10-16, NIV

This was an emotional time for the church. The highest
form of weeping, laughing, mourning & dancing occurs in
the context of worship. The psalms are a book for an
emotional people, to help us deal with the traumas of life
and express our deepest fears and longings and desperate
pleas to God. When we engage in true worship, God shines
a light into the dark places of our heart to bring truth,
repentance and freedom. Thus it was catastrophic when
converging forces prevented many faithful from worshiping
God as they had been taught. One word occurs four times
in this passage: darkness. When historians refer to this
period, what do they call it?

*The Dark Ages.*

What forces prevented Christians from worshiping? The
first was the Islamic Jihad, which ushered in a time when
*“there was no one to help”* (107:12). Many Christians were
slain, enslaved, or forced to convert. The second was the
reaction of the Byzantine Emperors. Fearing that the
success of Islam (which forbade any images of people or
animals in their art as idolatry) was God’s displeasure with
the use of icons in Christian worship, they took action.
During the Iconoclasm Controversy, iconoclasts (icon
haters) and iconodules (icon lovers) fought over which was
right. Surely some iconodules were practicing idolatry, just
as some iconoclasts were forbidding legitimate forms of
worship involving Christian art. The church finally worked
out the rules, but it took a century of civil unrest, warfare,
and theological debate to resolve the issue.
In a web article [76], Prof. Brad Elliott summarizes those
rules:

#### A particular image or group of images is appropriate
#### in a particular context in the life of the Church 
#### when the following conditions are satisfied:

  1. *It communicates truth to its observers.*
  2. *It neither discourages worship of God nor misdirects worship away from God.*

(See [Iconomy: A Rule Theory for Images in the Church](https://www.westmont.edu/~work/ARTICLES/iconomy.html) 
for details.)

When verse 16 of the psalm says “he breaks down gates
of bronze and cuts through bars of iron”, it echoes words
also proclaimed by Isaiah:

#### I will go before you and will level the mountains;
#### I will **break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron**...
#### ...
#### All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced;
#### they will go off into disgrace together.
###### - Isaiah 45:2,16, NIV

As Isaiah tells it, a war (the breaking of barred city gates)
would set people free from idolatry. In 726, Emperor Leo
III, an iconoclast, commanded that an icon of Christ be
removed from the Chalke Gate, the monumental gate at the
entrance to the palace in Constantinople. Chalke Gate
means “bronze gate”. Isaiah’s words were confirmed at last.

Bronze and iron also symbolize the Greek and Roman
empires, respectively. This time also saw the slow
movement away from the philosophy of the ancients
toward one rooted more solidly in the Bible.

The darkness of this era was not confined to the east. The
“Rule of the Harlots” corrupted the Roman Catholic Church
in the tenth century. Even so, there was a resurgence of
faith and order in the west. This occurred in proportion to
the position in which the word “love” occurred in this
passage, in verse 15, the sixth of seven verses.

Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and
brought order, education and culture to Western Europe.
Just as the center of power of the church moved east in the
previous era, in this one it moved west. By the end of the
era, most of Europe was ruled by Christian kings.
Charlemagne used his power for many things, but one
connects directly to this psalm. 
*“He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains.”*
Charlemagne forcefully opposed slavery throughout his domain.

## Power to Reach the North (996–1317 AD)

#### Some became fools through their rebellious ways
##### and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.
#### **They loathed all food**
##### **and drew near the gates of death.**
#### Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
##### and he saved them from their distress.
#### **He sent out his word and healed them;**
##### he rescued them from the grave.
#### Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
##### and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
#### Let them sacrifice thank offerings
##### and tell of his works with songs of joy.
###### - Psalm 107:17-22, NIV

In this time of relationships, of scattering and gathering
stones, of embracing and refraining, the Christian world
entered a crisis. The refraining was the Great Schism of
1054 AD, the final rupture between East and West. The
church tried to forge a path southward during the
Crusades, but after a brief time of success were again
driven out by the Saracens. The great northward expansion
of the church into Scandinavia and the Baltics was the
defining direction of motion.

Even so, these verses speak to the Crusaders who first
took Jerusalem. The entire enterprise was filled with
rebelliousness, disorder, poor planning, high casualties and
near disaster. As the soldiers neared the gates of Jerusalem,
food supplies were low. Despite privation, they trusted a
prophecy and “loathed all food”. This means that they
fasted and marched around the city in worship, imitating
Joshua’s siege of Jericho. God granted them the victory.

During this era, God *“sent out His word and healed them”*.
It saw the founding of several great monastic orders, such
as the Franciscans and Dominicans. From their ranks arose
great scholars like Aquinas who received that word and laid
the foundation for the great advance in science that would
reshape the world.

If the Western and Eastern churches could not embrace
each other, still other divides were bridged. In a famous
story, Saint Francis saw a leper along the road. Overcoming
the natural internal revulsion to avoid such a person, he
dismounted and embraced the man. Upon returning to his
horse, he turned to look, but the man was gone. He was
convinced that he had embraced the Lord himself. Like
Francis, his companions embraced the poor and brought
the gospel to the poor in the cities, far from the rural
monasteries where most monks lived.

The end of this era would see the troubles return. The
Great Famine of 1315–1317 claimed millions across Europe.
As with several previous sections, the word “love” comes
near the end of each passage, but not in the last verse. That
means that God’s greatest blessings fall in the second half of
each era, but not at its end. Each era ends in suffering.

This era has a second marker warning of trouble. One
letter of the Hebrew alphabet is nun. In two chapters of the
Bible and only two, passages are marked with an inverted
nun. The letter is mirrored. No one knows what it means
(though theories abound).

The first chapter that has inverted nuns is Numbers 10,
which has two:

#### Whenever the ark set out, Moses said,
##### “Rise up, LORD!
##### May your enemies be scattered;
##### may your foes flee before you.”
#### Whenever it came to rest, he said,
##### “Return, LORD,
##### to the countless thousands of Israel.”
###### - Numbers 10:35-36, NIV

So the first two occurrences speak of the Lord going out
to fight against His foes, then returning to the camp to rest
and abide with his people.

The second chapter that has inverted nuns is Psalm 107.
It has seven! The two occurrences in Numbers seems to
correspond to the Son, since the ark of the covenant held
the tablets of the law. Thus these seven occurrences refer to
the work of the Holy Spirit. Just as in Numbers, there are
two groups of inverted nuns. The first six are clumped
together in this section and the next, with one each in
verses 20–25. The last inverted nun is in the final section.

What does this tell us? The Holy Spirit would go out in
power to do battle against God’s enemies in this period and
the next. What happened during these two eras? Crusades.
Exploration. The conquest of the Americas. The Protestant
Reformation. The wars of religion and the General Crisis of
the 17th century. Out of the whole Bible, God marked these
verses as special. We need to pay close attention to them.

<span id="7"/>
## Power to Sail South (1317–1638 AD)

#### Some went out on the sea in ships;
##### they were merchants on the mighty waters.
#### They saw the works of the LORD,
##### his wonderful deeds in the deep.
#### **For he spoke and stirred up a tempest**
##### that lifted high the waves.
#### They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths;
##### in their peril their courage melted away.
#### They reeled and staggered like drunkards;
##### they were at their wits’ end.
#### Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
##### and he brought them out of their distress.
#### He stilled the storm to a whisper;
##### the waves of the sea were hushed.
#### They were glad when it grew calm,
##### and he guided them to their desired haven.
#### Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
##### and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
#### Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
##### and praise him in the council of the elders. 
###### - Psalm 107:23-32

This is the era devoted to resources: the times to search,
to give up, to keep, and throw away. With the gold of the
new world, God threw wide the storehouses of heaven and
supplied Christian nations with unimaginable wealth.

In a past chapter, the tragedy of this era was spelled out:
Byzantium is the treasure that was thrown away. The Black
Death claimed over half of Europe and waves of change
engulfed the world. The Holy Spirit is often compared to a
wind, and this passage carries the analogy to its most
extreme, with the Protestant Reformation being like a
second Pentecost.

As expressed earlier, the Hebrew word for south also
means the sea, and the gospel took to the seas as European
nations captured ports and islands in Africa, India, China
and the Americas. However, it is the completion of the
number four with the fourth compass direction that is most
stunning. The Book of Revelation speaks of the four
horsemen of the apocalypse. In earlier chapters we
identified when each horseman rode forth to judge the
world. This is where the interpretation of Scripture from a
historicist perspective proves most challenging. The
horsemen have not ridden forth once in the history of the
world, but many times. God’s principal judgment of Israel
occurred long ago. The judgement of the world has begun
and we await the opening of the fifth seal. This psalm
describes a different sortie: the judgment of the church.

The second, third, fourth and fifth sections of this psalm
describe the judgment of Rome and the church that clung
too closely to it for safety. Byzantium attempted too
harmonious and tight a relationship between church and
state. War, civil war, pestilence and death are the curses
that the horseman brought.

  - In the second era, the time of facing east, war came to Byzantium first with the Sassanid Empire, then with Islam.
  - In the third era, the time of facing west, Byzantium was convulsed by dozens of civil wars. The 7th and 8th centuries brought on more civil strife than at any other time in its history.
  - In the fourth era, the time of facing north, the pestilence of the Great Famine claimed many lives.
  - In the fifth era, the time of sailing the southern seas, the Black Plague killed even more, and the Fall of Constantinople spelled the final death of the Byzantine empire.

With this observation, we can understand the meaning of
the first six inverted nuns. God marked off this as a time of
reckoning. Consider this terrible idea. God had determined
that this era would experience a huge expansion of
Christianity throughout the world. You would think that in
such an important time a military commander would not
court marshal his best generals. Not so with God. He
disciplined the Eastern church with utmost severity and
raised up others to carry His banner. No individual and no
empire, however large, ancient, populous, or seemingly
indispensable, is exempt from God’s rod of correction.

<span id="8"/>
## Power to Reach the World (1638–1959 AD)

#### **He turned rivers into a desert**,
##### **flowing springs into thirsty ground**,
#### **and fruitful land into a salt waste**,
##### because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
#### He turned the desert into pools of water
##### and the parched ground into flowing springs;
#### there he brought the hungry to live,
##### and they founded a city where they could settle.
#### They sowed fields and planted vineyards
##### that yielded a fruitful harvest;
#### he blessed them, and **their numbers greatly increased**,
##### and he did not let their herds diminish.
###### - Psalm 107:33-38

By this point, the times of this psalm and those of the
previous clock of Solomon have started to converge. The
era of communication has arrived. The times to tear, mend,
to be silent and speak sweep over the world. The time to
tear was the General Crisis. The most deaths in those wars
occurred between 1615 and 1650, but additional wars filled
out the 17th century.

This passage says that God turned *“rivers into a desert”*
and *“fruitful land into a salt waste”*. The American
Southwest endured prolonged drought in the 16th century,
and the east coast (including Virginia) in the 17th century.
Measurements of shellfish dug up from that era show that
saltwater reached farther upstream near Jamestown than in
previous years, indicating heavy drought. Many have
written about how European explorers and settlers spread
disease to the Americas. Only recently have we learned that
the peoples of the Americas were weakened by severe
drought, which amplified the effects of the disease. God
used this drought to spread the gospel swiftly to a new
continent.

At the same time, God brought the hungry – the Pilgrims
and other settlers – to a new land and blessed their harvest.
Their numbers greatly increased, from a few thousand at
the beginning to hundreds of millions today in America, the
most prosperous nation the earth has ever known.

(It must also be noted that the Jewish settlers who
returned to Israel during this time found the land like a
desert but made it bloom.)

This episode describes unimaginable prosperity – and
ingratitude. In the preceding sections, people were called
upon to *“give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love”*. This
section displays God’s love like no other – but there is no
one to praise Him!

<span id="9"/>
## Power to Endure to the End (1959–2280 AD)

#### Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled
##### by oppression, calamity and sorrow;
#### he who pours contempt on nobles
##### made them wander in a trackless waste.
#### But he lifted the needy out of their affliction
##### and increased their families like flocks.
#### The upright see and rejoice,
##### but all the wicked shut their mouths.
#### Let the one who is wise heed these things
##### and ponder the loving deeds of the LORD.
###### - Psalm 107:39-43

The first verse of this section is the last place in the Bible
marked with an inverted nun. Their numbers decreased...
This describes a great apostasy, in which people desert
Christianity in large numbers. I believe that this final
inverted nun points to the final tribulation of the saints. In
Numbers, the second inverted nun was for the verse where
the Lord returns to the camp. This will not be a time for
victory in battle, but for worshiping God and rejoicing in
his return. Jesus Christ will return and he will win the
battle. It is for us to stand and endure to the end. It is for us
to “ponder the loving deeds of the LORD.” For all the terrible

## A Harvest of Harvests

If the seven historical psalms conform to a harvest
pattern, Psalm 107 must fit the fourth phase, “pouring
water”. How often does this psalm refer to the need for
water or storms?

  - Desert wastelands (107:4)
  - Thirsty (107:5)
  - He satisfies the thirsty (107:9)
  - Merchants on the mighty waters (107:23)
  - Wonderful deeds in the deep (107:24)
  - Tempest... waves (107:25)
  - Down to the depths (107:26)
  - He stilled the storm... waves... hushed. (107:29)
  - Turned rivers into a desert (107:33a)
  - flowing springs into thirsty ground (107:33b)
  - Fruitful land into a salt waste (107:34)
  - Turned the desert into pools of water (107:35a)
  - Parched ground into flowing springs (107:35b)
  - He who **pours** contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste. (107:40)

Thus the psalm as a whole uses imagery of a thirsty
desert passing through a storm toward a concluding
harvest time of plenty. The whole psalm speaks of the
watering of the Holy Spirit, but it also is broken into a finer
[harvest pattern](./harvest-pattern.html), according to the seven crises and rescues
we just explored.

**Preparation (107:1-3)**: The base of operations for all
that would follow was the conversion of Rome into a
Christian empire during the fourth century.

**Plowing (107:4-9)**: Multiple sacks of Rome, the fall of
the Western Roman Empire and the first Islamic Jihad
brought great suffering to the church.

**Planting (107:10-16)**: Most of Western Europe was
planted with the gospel. *“He brought them out of darkness.” *
The Word of God ended the Dark Ages and
enlightened the people as evidenced by the Carolingian
Renaissance.

**Pouring (107:17-22)**: *“He sent out his word and healed them.”* 
The Holy Spirit healed the heart of the church
through people like Saint Francis of Assisi.

**Plucking (107:23-32)**: *“They saw the works of the LORD, his **wonderful deeds** in the deep. For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.”* 
Wonderful deeds are miracles of the Father, who swept away nations
during the General Crisis and redirected the church to
focus on sending missionaries to the world by providing
it with vast resources and new vision.

**Producing a Harvest (107:33-38)**: *“Their numbers greatly increased.”* 
Christian missionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries went out and spread the gospel 
to the ends of the earth, producing a great harvest of saved sinners.

**Peace (107:39-43)**: One day, Jesus Christ will return, and
*“The upright see and rejoice, but all the wicked shut their mouths.”* (107:42)

## Pick a number, any number…

When cometh the Lord? Psalm 107 focuses on God’s
double ingathering of His exiled people. For the Jews it was
back into Israel, first from Babylon and then from the
nations. For the church, it was being sent into the world as
missionaries to gather lost souls into the church, then in
the future, to be raptured up to Heaven. We want to know
when that last event will occur, but it is and will remain a
surprise.

Despite Jesus’ declaration that no one will know the day
or the hour, many try, and the gullible believe them. If such
a person inspects the fruits of the research presented in
this book, they will have all the ammunition they need to
make new predictions. Let’s play a game. I call it **Rapture Roulette**.

Say that the time of war completes in 2280 AD as the rest
of this book argues. By the chronology employed
throughout, this will be the year 6300 AM (anno mundi, or
years since creation). Will peace come immediately? After
the completion of another 120 year generation? Or partway
through that 42nd generation, as suggested elsewhere in
this work?

One principle stated and adhered to during this analysis
of the Bible and history is that ideas from numerology are
creative ways to find possible connections in Scripture, but
those ideas must be solidified via other textual evidence. A
careless or manipulative scholar will produce dazzling
numbers to argue their point when such evidence is
lacking. Seeing such numbers can persuade troubled
people longing for an answer. The problem is that the
deceiver will show one number but withhold six others that
appear equally compelling.

If we concede that the Lord intends to return between
6300 AM and 6420 AM, which years look most likely based
solely on numerology? We will take the prime factors of
each year, counting from the creation.

**6300 AM (2280 AD)**. *Factors: 2·2·3·3·5·5·7*. We see the
Son (2) twice, the Father (2) twice, the number for the short
harvest (5) twice, and the number for the Holy Spirit (7)
once, but there are seven factors total, for a second 7. Thus
this year represents the final harvest by the Trinity of
mankind. Do you feel goosebumps?

**6318 AM (2298 AD)**. *Factors: 2·3·3·3·3·3·13*. This year also
has seven prime factors, for the Holy Spirit. The Son (2)
appears once, but the Father (3) appears five times,
representing the harvest. Thirteen (13) is our bonus
number. We didn’t cover this in the chapter on numbers,
but it is a powerful number (courtesy of biblestudy.org's article, 
[The Number 13](https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/13.html) ):

  - Mark 7 lists 13 things that defile a person.
  - Solomon spent 13 years building his palace (six years longer than the temple).
  - Haman persuaded the King to sign a decree to kill the Jews. The decree was signed on the 13th day of the first month and was to go into effect on the 13th day of the 12th month.
  - The Valley of Ben Hinnom (aka Hinnom Valley), where idolaters sacrificed children to Moloch, is mentioned 13 times in the Bible.
  - Nimrod, the 13th man in Ham’s line, rebelled against God at Babel, so this number represents rebelliousness.
  - The word *dragon*, referring to Satan, occurs 13 times in Revelation.

Taking all those numbers together, we have Father, Son
and Holy Spirit defeating the dragon. The dragon
sacrificed other people’s children to gain power but the
Son offered his own life to give power away, to forgive
and resurrect the dead. More shivers.

**6324 AM (2304 AD)**. *Factors: 2·2·3·17·31*. We have the Son
(2) twice, meaning his second coming, and the Father (3)
once. Seventeen (17) stands for victory and thirty-one (31) is
the length of the longest month (and the number of kings
vanquished by Joshua), meaning total victory. Uh oh, no
Holy Spirit here.

**6342 AM (2322 AD)**. *Factors: 2·3·7·151*. We see the Trinity
again plus 151. The Septuagint and some other Bibles have
151 Psalms. The extra Psalm is about King David slaying
Goliath. Most apropos.

**6377 AM (2357 AD)**. *Factors: 7·911*. If all the Christians in
the world (7 for completeness) called Heaven’s 911 line (via
prayer), would they be raptured during this year?

**6384 AM (2364 AD)**. *Factors: 2·2·2·2·3·7·19*. The Son
seems eager in this scheme, with four factors, the Father is
reserved and there are seven factors total, so the Holy
Spirit is well represented. If 19 is a reference to Psalm 19,
then the Heavens declare the glory of God, which seems a
fair summary of what will happen when Christ returns.

**6420 AM (2400 AD)**. *Factors: 2·2·3·5·107*. Rounding out
our top seven candidates for numbers that prophecy when
Jesus will return, this one takes the cake. The Son (2)
appears twice, for the second coming. The Father (3) is on
hand and the final harvest (5) is being gathered in. Finally,
we have Psalm 107, the subject of the present chapter. Since
it is about gathering together the exiles (with the rapture
being the final ingathering) and is the core of the Holy
Spirit’s clock, this number is weighty. I’m sold!

There you have it: seven numbers for seven years, all of
which can be spun to tell a story that seems to point to the
return of Christ, and all falling within the final 120-year
generation of peace. Do not be mislead. If God wants to
speed up Christ’s return to show mercy and is as
superstitious as we are about numbers, he has many
options, all of which will make for a nice postscript to His
Word and present uncertainty to us.

Pick a number, any number. Spin the Rapture Roulette
wheel. Maybe you will guess right and win a prize…

(Note: Psalm 107 is not the only one whose structure
conforms to the twenty-eight times of Solomon’s Celestial
Clock. See “Appendix D: To Number our Psalms” for an
analysis of the prophecies found in Psalm 102, among other
things.)
