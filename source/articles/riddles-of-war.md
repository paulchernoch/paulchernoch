## The Place of Proverbs 30 within the book

The whole Book of Proverbs is one big riddle. We are told in 25:1 that King Hezekiah's men had a part in selecting and arranging 
material attributed to Solomon. In 30:1, we hear that an oracle named Agur, son of Jakeh is responsible for that chapter.
Lastly, in 31:1, we hear that the final chapter was based on wisdom from King Lemuel and his mother.
For centuries, scholars have battled over how the various books of the Bible were written and edited, by whom, and when they
were assembled into their current form. Proverbs is that rare book that includes traces of its editorial process.
The book admits that it is a collective effort conducted over the centuries, so nobody can dispute that.

Apart from set pieces, like some of the poems in the beginning and the chapters at the end mentioned above, Proverbs appears to the casual
reader in most chapters to be a random collection of aphorisms presented in no discernible order. True, some chapters have many 
proverbs related to a single theme. One example is Proverbs 26, which looks at several categories of foolish speech from different
angles. However, as a whole, it is difficult to detect a tight progression of thought from start to finish. As an anthology, how could it?
As for the chapter boundaries, in the absence of a clear structure, how can you tell whether they were set in the best places?

The preceding questions are the riddle of Proverbs as a whole. Without solving that riddle, solving the riddle of what Proverbs 30 means
is impossible. In "Appendix E: The Plan of Proverbs" from *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, a solution to that riddle is given,
as well as the analysis of Proverbs 30 that you will find replicated here. Despite multiple authors, Proverbs does conform to 
a single structure. The current chapter boundaries were not added until Stephen Langton did so in 1205 AD.
Even though he did not know the underlying structure of Proverbs and accomplished his work almost two thousand years after 
the book was completed, he got the chapter boundaries right; they do not contradict the structure. That is evidence of divine assistance.

The solution to the meta-riddle is that the first three chapters of Proverbs are an introduction, followed by twenty-eight chapters 
that conform to the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 31. It is likely that the Holy Spirit caused this arrangement;
if it was the work of the editors from Hezekiah's time, some record of that plan would have been left to us.

With every chapter matching one of Solomon's times, what does that say about Proverbs 30? It says that the chapter should
be a commentary on "a time for war". Since this is the penultimate time preceding the hoped for era of peace, that makes
is a very important chapter. Even without this knowledge, if you read the proverbs of this chapter, you will see two things 
at odds with one another. The thirty-three verses may be divided into thirteen sayings. The topics of the sayings seem unrelated 
but the same literary form is used in many of them. That form is to count similar things, then list them:

  - v7: two things I ask of you
  - v15a: The leech has two daughters
  - v15b: Three things are never satisfied
  - v18: Three things are too wonderful for me
  - v21: Under three things the earth trembles
  - v24: Four things on earth are small
  - v29: Three things are stately in their tread

In addition to that, there are four "there are those..." parables from 30:11-14. This obvious stylistic
consistency is absent from most chapters in Proverbs. Anyone who reads chapter 30 will have the sense that
there is some larger point that the author is trying to make, but it will elude them.
That point is God's battle plan for the final war between good and evil.
Deciphering that plan was not easy. That is what made the victory of solving this riddle so sweet.
