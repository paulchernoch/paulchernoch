## The Place of Proverbs 30 within the book

The whole Book of Proverbs is one big riddle. We are told in 25:1 that King Hezekiah's men had a part in selecting and arranging 
material attributed to Solomon. In 30:1, we hear that an oracle named Agur, son of Jakeh is responsible for that chapter.
Lastly, in 31:1, we hear that the final chapter was based on wisdom from King Lemuel and his mother.
For centuries, scholars have battled over how the various books of the Bible were written and edited, by whom, and when they
were assembled into their current form. Proverbs is that rare book that includes traces of its editorial process.
The book admits that it is a collective effort conducted over the centuries, so nobody can dispute that.

Apart from set pieces, like some of the poems in the beginning and the chapters at the end mentioned above, Proverbs appears to the casual
reader in most chapters to be a random collection of aphorisms presented in no discernible order. True, some chapters have many 
proverbs related to a single theme. One example is Proverbs 26, which looks at several categories of foolish speech from different
angles. However, as a whole, it is difficult to detect a tight progression of thought from start to finish. 
(That is, unless the reader is a lonely bachelor, in which case the main theme is obvious - get a good wife!) 
As an anthology, how could it? As for the chapter boundaries, in the absence of a clear structure, how can you tell whether 
they were set in the best places?

The preceding questions are the riddle of Proverbs as a whole. Without solving that riddle, solving the riddle of what Proverbs 30 means
is impossible. In "Appendix E: The Plan of Proverbs" from *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, a solution to that riddle is given,
as well as the analysis of Proverbs 30 that you will find replicated here. Despite multiple authors, Proverbs does conform to 
a single structure. The current chapter boundaries were not added until Stephen Langton did so in 1205 AD.
Even though he did not know the underlying structure of Proverbs and accomplished his work almost two thousand years after 
the book was completed, he got the chapter boundaries right; they do not contradict the structure. That is evidence of divine assistance.

The solution to the meta-riddle is that the first three chapters of Proverbs are an introduction, followed by twenty-eight chapters 
that conform to the twenty-eight times of Ecclesiastes 31. It is likely that the Holy Spirit caused this arrangement;
if it was the work of the editors from Hezekiah's time, some record of that plan would have been left to us.

With every chapter matching one of Solomon's times, what does that say about Proverbs 30? It says that the chapter should
be a commentary on "a time for war". Since this is the penultimate time preceding the hoped for era of peace, that makes
is a very important chapter. Even without this knowledge, if you read the proverbs of this chapter, you will see two things 
at odds with one another. The thirty-three verses may be divided into thirteen sayings. The topics of the sayings seem unrelated 
but the same literary form is used in many of them. That form is to count similar things, then list them:

  - v7: two things I ask of you
  - v15a: The leech has two daughters
  - v15b: Three things are never satisfied
  - v18: Three things are too wonderful for me
  - v21: Under three things the earth trembles
  - v24: Four things on earth are small
  - v29: Three things are stately in their tread

In addition to that, there are four "there are those..." parables from 30:11-14. This obvious stylistic
consistency is absent from most chapters in Proverbs. Anyone who reads chapter 30 will have the sense that
there is some larger point that the author is trying to make, but it will elude them.
What is that point? **Proverbs 30 is God's battle plan for the final war between good and evil.**
Deciphering that plan was not easy. That is what made the victory of solving this riddle so sweet.

## Proverbs 30. 2160–2280 AD. A time for war

### Theme

Several verses here transport us to the
battlefield of this “time for war” where weapons are drawn:

#### There are those whose teeth are **swords**,
##### whose fangs are **knives**,
#### to devour the poor from off the earth,
##### the needy from among mankind. (30:14)

We see a shield (30:5), insects behaving like advancing
soldiers, for *“the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank”.* (30:27). 
After that, one appears to lead them,
when we see *“a king whose army is with him.”* (30:31) 
Then the chapter ends with the strife of a fistfight:

#### For pressing milk produces curds,
##### pressing the nose produces blood,
##### and pressing anger produces strife. (30:33)

Woven in among the references to war are the causes
that inflame it: covetousness (30:15-16), pride (30:29-31),
boasting (30:32), anger (30:33), and usurpation (30:21-23).
You can almost hear the trumpets announce the charge. Yet
amongst the chaos, there is a well-defined plan…

### Prophecy

Before that plan, a riddle. This chapter
contains the first Bible riddle I ever solved. I am not alone
in solving it, but oh the thrill when I first read it!

#### Surely I am only a brute, not a man;
#### I do not have human understanding.
#### I have not learned wisdom,
#### nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.
#### **Who has gone up to heaven and come down?**
#### Whose hands have gathered up the wind?
#### Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak?
#### Who has established all the ends of the earth?
#### **What is his name, and what is the name of his son?**
#### Surely you know! (Proverbs 30:2-4, NIV)

Jesus, Son of God, came down to earth in the incarnation
and ascended to heaven again after his resurrection. What
a marvelous riddle. What a satisfying answer for a Christian
looking for confirmation of their beliefs in the Old
Testament.

What a misreading! The riddle I solved was “Who has
come down from heaven and gone up?” I had it backwards.
This riddle is not about the incarnation and ascension. It is
about the ascension and rapture. This riddle is also not
about Christ alone. It is about his church. Every believer
who has died and ascended to heaven will come down with
Jesus to join those who remain alive.

When I solved that riddle years ago, I was missing a
crucial piece of the answer. According to Solomon’s times,
chapter 30 is *“a time for war”* and falls between 2160–2280 AD.
Just as Enoch was raptured near the beginning of the
second generation, so by symmetry this rapture will occur
near the end of the next to last time.

This introduction to the chapter seems benign, but what
do we know about the time when God shall come down
from heaven?

#### Oh that you would **rend the heavens and come down**,
##### that the mountains might quake at your presence—
#### as when fire kindles brushwood
##### and the fire causes water to boil—
#### **to make your name known to your adversaries,**
##### **and that the nations might tremble at your presence!**
#### - Isaiah 64:1-2, ESV

When God finally comes down from heaven, it will be to
join the battle. How may we prepare? What is the battle
plan? Has the Lord told us anything solid about how this
conflict will unfold?

Yes! Just as Proverbs 26 gave Satan’s long term strategy
for opposing the church, this chapter describes the
climactic years of the war. Besides the riddle about the
Lord descending from heaven, it contains seven parables
which each group four observations into a unit for
comparison. Where numbers appear, there is often a
progression of some sort. Where the same number appears
again and again, there is a clock to be found.

### The Battle Clock

Despite the extensive use of many
symbols found in other clocks and prophecies covered
previously in this book, inferring the structure of this
chapter took almost a week. It employs chiasms,
progressions through time and space, the numbers four
and seven, the harvest pattern and Solomon’s twenty-eight
times. It also connects to the five missionary eras.

In the following analysis, the patterns in this chapter will
be applied mostly to history. Since it describes tactics and
strategies of the war between good and evil, it is likely that
this pattern will repeat in the future in unexpected ways on
a shorter timescale when the final “time for war” arrives.
We are living through the dry run.

At the largest scale, the war story is as follows:

- Announce the Oracle (30:1a)
- Introduce the rightful leader – God (30:1b)
  - Leader & his servants march to battle (30:2–4)
    - Certify the oracle (30:5–6)
    - Introduce the loyal servants (30:7–9)
      - Cassus belli: crimes against the servants (30:10)
      - Evil behavior of the rebels (30:11–14)
    - Introduce rebels opposing the servants (30:15a)
  - Rebels march to battle (30:15b–31)
- Reveal the rebel leader (30:32–33)

### Quartets

The preceding is not the only structure
involved. Through a clever bit of misdirection, the reader is
made to focus on the formula “three things… four”. Four
proverbs use this formula and a fifth uses “four things”
without the three (30:24–28). Two proverbs count using
“two”. Look closer and you see another list of four items
without a count (30:11–14) that use the formula “there are
those”. How do these units relate to one another?

After studying the Psalms and Ecclesiastes, we are now
accustomed to seeing things grouped into fours and sevens.
Though it may not look like it, we have seven parables each
consisting of four parts. Four follow the three-four pattern
and three do not. The first two are trickiest. The loyal
servant begins in verse 7 by saying, *“Two things I ask of you…”* 
Later on, in verse 15, we have 
*“The leech has two daughters: Give and Give.”* 
Two plus two equals four. These verses describe the heart attitude 
of the the two warring parties. The servant exhibits contentment 
and the rebel, covetousness and discontent.

What complicates this pattern is that between the two
“twos”, we have in verses 11–14 a description of the evil
behavior of the rebels using the formula “there are those”.
Thus one quartet parable is wedged inside another. This
device shows how the two parties – servants and rebels –
are enemies in this conflict, separated by crimes committed
by the rebels. Also, this first quartet of the two “twos”
corresponds in the harvest pattern to the preparation
phase, when a person is consecrated or exiled, separated
from normal society for God’s purposes. Thus the offense
against the servants in verse 10 (slander) and the other evil
behavior of verses 11–14 (cursing, self-deceit, pride, and
malicious talk) deepen the separation and constitute the
plowing phase of suffering.

The remaining five quartet parables (15b–16, 18–19, 21–23,
24–28, and 29–31) each match subsequent phases of the
harvest, with a twist. Instead of true peace, the final phase
is victory in battle.

### Ascent and Descent of the Righteous

Thus we have seven quartets, or 7 x 4 = 28 in the largest part of the
chapter. The four is emphasized by repeating the three-four
formula four times. Four relates to the seasons hence to
time. The introduction of the ruler also makes use of these
two numbers via addition: 4 + 7 = 11. If not for this simple
formula, the connection between verses 2–3 and verse 4
would never have occurred to me.

In Job 38–41, the metaphors follow a simple but easily
overlooked spatial progression. God begins from heaven,
passes through the heavens to the sky and birds, then to
the land with the animals, before approaching the
battlefield at the end of chapter 39. In chapter 40, He
descends into the grave to face Behemoth, before finally
meeting Leviathan in the heart of the sea in chapter 41.

We have a similar (albeit abbreviated) journey here,
which first ascends and then descends.

- A. *Surely I am too **stupid** to be a man.* (30:2a). The NIV say “I am a brute”. In humility, the writer claims to have only as much sense as the animals.
  - B. *I have not the **understanding** of a man.* (30:2b) He rises to the level of basic human comprehension, but not so great as an educated, intelligent person.
    - C. *I have not learned **wisdom…*** (30:3a) Now he possesses understanding, but not the heights of worldly wisdom possessed by the greatest sages.
      - D. *nor have I **knowledge of the Holy One**.* (30:3b) Now he ascends to the heights of secular wisdom, but lacks the knowledge imparted only by the Holy One.
        - E. *Who has **ascended to heaven…*** Passing beyond holy knowledge, he miraculously arises. This encompasses the ascension of both Christ and the saints who by rapture or a blessed death rise to meet him.
          - F. *and **come down**?* With escort divine and perception transformed, the leader ( Jesus) and his faithful servants descend to approach the field of battle.
        - E’. *Who has gathered the **wind** in his fists?* Through air…
      - D’. *Who has wrapped up the **waters** in a garment?* & water, which by baptism symbolizes the Holy One
    - C’. *Who has established all the ends of the **earth**?* … to earth.
  - B’. *What is his name, and what is his son's name?* At last understanding the Son of Man…
- A’. *Surely you know!* (30:4) … with sure knowledge at last.

Notice how the heart of the chiasm is not the ascent up to
heaven, it is the descent. Notice also that the ascent is of
the mind attaining greater insight, whereas the descent is in
the physical realm, by power, as God controls the wind,
water and earth. The first four parts are about the humility
of the oracle whose understanding grows through time (as
symbolized by four). Then the remaining seven are about
the wisdom and power of God and His Son, for 4 + 7 = 11. As
soon as ignorance of the Holy One is declared, we enter the
realm of the Holy Spirit, whose number is seven.

The ascent and descent are further enclosed in two
statements about the oracle, in verses 1 and 5–6. The first
announces it, along with the speaker’s weakness. It is
common for prophets to be overcome with weakness in the
presence of God’s strength. The second statement declares
the power and truthfulness of that oracle, with a warning
that God will demonstrate his powerful wrath against any
who corrupt that word. This warning is similar to the
warnings at the end of Ecclesiastes and Revelation.

So God and His servants arrive in glorious majesty and
power from on high. How does the enemy leader arrive?

### Ascent and Descent of the Enemy

The attributes of the rebel leader are described in the
conclusion of the chapter:

#### If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
##### or if you have been devising evil,
###### put your hand on your mouth.
#### For pressing milk produces curds,
##### pressing the nose produces blood,
###### and pressing anger produces strife. 
###### (30:32-33)

Self-exaltation describes the rebel’s boastful mouth,
where the realm of truth is filled with lies. Devising evil
describes the rebel’s wicked heart, where the seat of desire
has corrupted goals. The command to “put your hand on
your mouth” is a command to not use the hand (physical
action) to act on the evil impulses of mind and heart but do
something useful – stop uttering foolish words. Yet the rebel
does not heed the warning. He punches the righteous in
the nose to draw blood and stirs up strife.

“Pressing anger” in verse 33 is about the heart and
“pressing the nose” is about action. This would lead one to
think that “pressing milk” had to do with speech, the only
category of verse 32 without a match in verse 33. This may
be an ancient but unfamiliar idiom. Churning milk into
butter or cheese changes its character. This may refer to
corrupting the effect of speech through deceit.

We know that Satan exalted himself, claiming equality
with God, and he is a violent liar, so these verses unmask
him. The question remains, how will the battle unfold? The
answer is found in two places: seven four-part parables and
four interruptions. First, let us visit the interruptions, for
they identify the fields of battle.

### The Five Battlefields

It is easy to miss the five interruptions to the poetic
structures in Proverbs 30. In my case, these six verses (5–6,
10, 17, 20, 32–33) were what was left over after removing all
the patterns I could recognize. That makes them an anti-
pattern. In three cases judgment is declared explicitly
(verses 5–6, 10 & 17). In the other two (verses 20 and 32–33),
judgment is implicit, for it names two figures from
Revelation that received judgment.

The five battlefields are:

  - the individual (30:5-6)
  - the workplace (30:10)
  - the family (30:17)
  - the church (30:20)
  - the state (30:32-33)

*The individual*. Very few were the times when God spoke
to a crowd – apart from Jesus’ earthly ministry. Most
conversations were with individuals like Abraham, Moses,
Isaiah, or Paul.

#### Every word of God proves true;
##### he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
#### Do not add to his words,
##### lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. (30:5-6)

The above words condemn directly to the person who
disparages, distorts, adds to or removes from the words of
this chapter. Then by extension this may be applied to all of
Proverbs and to the whole Bible. Yet this declaration of
protection by God for His word extends farther. Every
saint, pastor, priest, monk, mother or father, Sunday
school teacher, or theologian who following prayer, careful
reflection on your word and with a sincere heart and the
assistance of the Holy Spirit speaks divine truth and
comfort to the people around them is also protected.

It is individuals who stood for the right of the common
people to read the Bible in their own language and were
martyred. It was individuals who taught us that we can be
saved by grace alone through faith alone and faced invading
armies sent to silence them. It was individuals who went
overseas to share their faith with the world. The enemy
attacks individuals, because it is to individual hearts that
God’s love speaks.

*The workplace*. Verse 10 dives into our work relationships,
saying,

#### “Do not slander a servant to his master, 
#### lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.”

The worst situation in this field is slavery, but other forms of 
oppression related to work have occurred in history. 
Because of the concentric embedding of this verse within the first two quartets, 
this battlefield is introduced twice: halfway through the first
quartet and before second quartet. Halfway through the
first quartet means 240 years after 960 BC, or 720 BC, just
a couple years after Israel was carried into Assyrian
Captivity. Such enslavement certainly relates to the
workplace. It also starts off the chain of empires that would
enslave Israel: Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and
Rome.

The second quartet began in 480 BC. It ended with the
incarnation, when the Son of God 
*“emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant”* 
(Philippians 2:7, ESV). God did
the inconceivable. Many cry to him for liberty, but who
expected Him to sacrifice his own to achieve this?

*The family*. The Nazis created Hitler Youth to replace
traditional morality and religion with his demonic
philosophy. They knew that they needed to seize the
authority to teach children away from their parents. the
communists did similar things. Today, when you hear about
the governor of a major state or the head of a teacher’s
union saying that parents should not dictate what is taught
in public schools, it is the same thing. They want to break
the family’s ability to teach their Christian faith to the next
generation.

#### There are those who curse their **fathers**
##### and do not bless their **mothers**. (30:11)

#### The eye that mocks a **father**
##### and scorns to obey a **mother**
#### will be picked out by the ravens of the valley
##### and eaten by the vultures. (Proverbs 30:17, ESV)

Verse 11 is part of one of the quartets and describes one
crime of the wicked as recalling against parents. Then verse
17 describes God’s judgment. It isn’t pretty. The family is a
crucial part of God’s plan of salvation. Without it, the faith
would be gone in two generations.

The seven quartets correspond to seven eras of four
times each, beginning with Solomon’s temple dedication in
960 BC. Thus the placement of this battleground verse falls
between the third and fourth eras, circa 480 AD. If it
announces actions to commence in the subsequent era,
then what occurred between 480–600 AD related to the
family? In 529 AD, Emperor Justinian enacted a new legal
code for the Roman Empire that attempted to incorporate
Christian morality into law. One change was to abolish no-
fault divorce, which had been practiced for a thousand
years. This innovation was swept away by his successor, but
it signaled the start of many cultural changes to how
families were constituted and governed.

*The church*. The devil’s attack on religious institutions is
relentless. If individuals hear God’s guidance and families
propagate it, the church organizes it into a force for good,
in areas like charity, education and medicine.

#### This is the way of an **adulteress**:
##### she eats and wipes her mouth
###### and says, “I have done no wrong.” (30:20)

The adulteress is used as a metaphor for false religion.
Revelation 17 describes her as a prostitute astride a scarlet
beast. Though this passage does not declare her downfall,
other proverbs and other prophets do.

The placement of this battleground verse falls between
the fourth and fifth eras, circa 960 AD. It commences a
major destabilization of the church as well as significant
reforms. The Great Schism of 1054 AD kicked things off and
the Fall of Constantinople amplified it. Battles within the
church would continue to escalate in subsequent times.

*The state*. The progression throughout the chapter is
clear. Individual, work, family, church, state… Each
comprises a larger sphere of authority and scope of action.
We have already studied verses 32–33 in regards to how by
revealing the character of the rebel they also revealed his
identity – Satan. Since Satan is a tyrant who seeks to
dominate all world systems, this passage doubles as the
final battlefield. The two most lethal situations in society
are anarchy and tyranny. Anarchy kills more people, but
seldom lasts long. People long for security so that they can
carry out basic responsibilities like farming, building
houses and raising kids without brigands attacking them
constantly. To suppress the anarchy, people submit to
governments. Thus Satan fosters anarchy to push people
toward his chosen form of government and thereby enslave
them.

Pride, violence, lies and evil – all are found in the
conclusion of this oracle. The battlefields have been
identified. Now it is time to look at the sevenfold battle
plan. Each parable corresponds to a timeless element of
war while also prophetically matching successive eras in
history, following Solomon’s Clock.

## The Sevenfold Battle Plan

The seven riddling quartets stand for seven dimensions
of the battle plan. They have universal aspects, but some
reference a particular era of history.

  - **Combatants** (30:7–9,15a) *Security*. 960–480 BC.
  - **Cassus belli** (30:10–14) *Ability*. 480 BC–1 AD.
  - **Cost** (30:15b–16) *Stability*. 1–480 AD.
  - **Strategy** (30:18–19) *Amity*. 480–960 AD.
  - **Promotion** (30:21–23) *Opportunity*. 960–1440.
  - **Tactics** (30:24–28) *Community*. 1440–1920 AD.
  - **Leadership** (30:29–31) *Loyalty*. 1920–2280 AD.

**Combatants**. The combatants are the righteous and the
wicked. By embedding references to the character of the
wicked (the cause of the war) within this first riddle, we see
the inevitability of the conflict. It flows from the nature of
the wicked, not the righteous. The wicked are the
aggressors. The opposing poles are contentment versus
greed, envy and jealousy.

The splitting of the first riddle into two pieces, one for
the righteous and one for the wicked, shows graphically the
division of Israel due to its civil war. The corresponding
quartet of times includes *“a time to die”* and is
acknowledged by the writer, who says, 
*“Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me **before I die**.”* 
As for planting and uprooting, the writer pleads for a middle way, 
of enjoying his daily bread instead of poverty (uprooting) or riches
(planting).

The first life phase is *Security*. Security is the concern
expressed by both wicked and righteous in this quartet.
The fundamental difference is the party each turns to to
obtain that security. The righteous turn to God in humility
while the wicked turn to other humans with violent
demands to “Give!” They pervert a word supposed to refer
to voluntary goodness and generosity into a selfish
command backed by force. Sounds like communism to me.

**Cassus belli**. The primary cause of the war is the
persecution of the righteous by the wicked in verse 10. The
interesting thing is that it singles out slander as the offense,
not murder or some other atrocity. Slander is an offense of
speech and relates to the Word. Thus the key offense is the
opposing of God’s Word, his Son, by lies. This second era of
the battle clock is also the era when no prophets spoke to
Israel, the time between the testaments. Thus while the
wicked raged, God remained silent.

Other offenses of the wicked relate to this time period.
*“There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.”* (30:11) 
Queen Esther lived at the beginning of this
era. Her husband, the king of Persia, passed legislation that
granted tyrannical powers to husbands over their wives, on
account of his wrath over Queen Vashti’s behavior.
Likewise, in 449 BC, the young Roman Republic
promulgated *The Laws of the Twelve Tables*, the first
codification of its laws. This enshrined principles that gave
powers of life and death, liberty and slavery over family
members to fathers, called *patria potestas*. This was
humanity’s harsh, unforgiving, unjust and overbearing
solution to children disrespecting their parents.

As for arrogance, *“There are those—how lofty are their*
*eyes, how high their eyelids lift!”* (30:13) This describes
Alexander the Great to a T, *“whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives…”* (30:14) 
He and others like him *“devour the poor”* by enslaving them in ever larger numbers.
On the other hand, this era ended with a different kind
of family and a different kind of conqueror. Joseph listened
to an angel and set aside his right to divorce Mary. Then
Joseph and Mary risked everything to protect their son,
serving him and not themselves. Finally, Jesus became poor
that he might lift up *“the needy from among mankind”* and
devour their oppressors instead.

The second era corresponds to the life phase of Ability.
The Greeks and Romans developed many new abilities in
Mathematics, Science, Engineering and Philosophy. Yet the
charges against the wicked summarize where children –
and civilizations – go wrong. Their families are
dysfunctional, their hearts self-righteous, their words
proud and their actions violent and oppressive.

**Cost**. In Luke 14:31–38, Jesus urges people to count the
cost of following him: 

#### “Or what king, going out to encounter
#### another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate
#### whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes
#### against him with twenty thousand?”

Jesus counted the cost of obeying and paid it. The cost was death on a cross.

#### Three things are never satisfied;
#### four never say, !Enough”:
##### **Sheol**,
##### **the barren womb**,
##### **the land** never satisfied with water,
##### **and the fire** that never says, "Enough." (30:15b–16)

The proverb lists the consequences of war from most to
least severe. If you begin with fire and go backwards, the
order should look familiar as it is the order of the four
horsemen of the apocalypse. In Revelation, the list as it is
popularly spoken is “war, famine, pestilence and death.”
The more precise list is war, civil war, pestilence and death.
However, civil war is a judgment against the land. Civil war
interrupts agriculture, leading to famine. A drought-
induced famine can cause the inverse as people fighting
over scarce resources trigger a civil war.

  - *Fire* means war and is used as analogy in many prophecies, such as Judges 9:7–15, where brambles are set alight and consume the trees of the forest.
  - *Water* when absent causes drought, leading to famine, a curse on the land.
  - *The womb* becomes barren due to poor nutrition, miscarriage or the death of children in battle.
  - *The grave* (Sheol) opens its jaws to welcome the dead.

This era was when Jesus, who had miraculously entered
a barren womb, became living water and bread of life and
overcame the grave. The Holy Spirit descended with
tongues like fire and the church spread like a wildfire until
the whole Roman Empire was consumed. Jesus and his
church counted the cost, paid it, and though smaller in
number overcame their beastly foe.

The cost encompassed all four classical elements: air,
water, earth, and fire. Air is the breath of the Spirit given to
us when we are born. Water is the womb which protects.
Earth is the land we depend upon for food. And fire
protects us from cold and cooks our food. All are taken by
death. All are offered anew by God in His Kingdom.

By the end of the life phase of Stability, the church held
the reins of history’s longest enduring empire. Surely that
was a stable foundation upon which to build!

#### "Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord God,
#### "when I will send a **famine** on the land— not a **famine** of
#### bread, nor a **thirst** for water, but of hearing the words of
#### the Lord.”
###### - Amos 8:11, ESV

At last the famine of Amos was over. The full Word could
now be heard.

**Strategy**. Though the next era encompasses the life
phase of Amity (relationships), the parable of eagle,
serpent, ship and maiden spans the whole church age, not
just 480–960 AD. Furthermore, without prior analysis of
Job and Matthew to inform the analysis, verse 17 would be
tossed aside, for it makes the four analogies of the parable
into five, corresponding to the five missionary eras of the
church.

#### The eye that mocks a father
#### and scorns to obey a mother
#### will be picked out by the **ravens** of the valley
#### and eaten by the vultures.
#### Three things are too wonderful for me;
#### four I do not understand:
#### the way of an **eagle** in the sky,
#### the way of a **serpent** on a rock,
#### the way of a **ship** on the high seas,
#### and the way of a man with a **virgin**. 
###### - (30:17–19)

The subtlety of this parable is matchless. The judgement
by the ravens is set off from the the other four because the
first has to do with God’s gracious provision for and
protection of a defenseless church during its early years
and the first missionary age, the days of the Apostolic
church. The other four indicate the church leaving its place
of security to wage war against the devil’s minions in four
campaigns of increasing scope and difficulty.

First, let us prove from Job that these five images belong
together. To Job (and later Elijah), ravens were first symbols
of God’s grace, not his judgment. 

#### “Who provides for the **raven** its prey, 
#### when its young ones cry to God for help,
#### and wander about for lack of food?” 
###### - Job 38:41

God fed Elijah by ravens and his church in like manner, when it was
too few in number and too weak in power to act on its own.

God continues his speech by commenting on many
animals, such as the eagle (Job 39:27–31) and Behemoth
(Job 40:15–24), which resembles a dinosaur in description
and corresponds to the snake of our parable, as it is a
reptile and symbolically a servant of Satan. Next up is
Leviathan ( Job 41), whom God says it is folly to hunt with a
harpoon from a ship. Last is the maid or virgin, of which
three appear in Job 42: Job’s beautiful daughters. The
passages about the raven, eagle, behemoth, and leviathan
each conclude the respective chapters, and but two verses
about Job’s end follow the words about his daughters. So
the five most prominent images from the five chapters of
God’s speech are the five images in this parable. That is
subtle!

If Job’s speech is structured around these five images
and Proverbs 30 lists them in the same order, that order is
surely significant. As related earlier, God’s speech in Job is a
journey from heaven, to the sky, to the earth, to the gates
of the underworld, to battle against Satan’s champion, and
finally to victory and peace. It is a path. The parable in
Proverbs 30 speaks of a mysterious way. It is the same. It is
the path God chose for His church to follow in order to
build his kingdom.

It is also the path followed by Israel:

  - *The raven* was the miraculous means God used to sustain Elijah in the wilderness in 1 Kings, when he was on the run from Jezebel and Ahab. Elijah’s experience is a foreshadowing of Judah’s exile. A vital detail is Jezebel’s heritage: she was daughter of the king of Tyre.
  - *The eagle* is spoken sometimes as an image of God’s care, bit more often as an agent of judgment carrying people into exile. This sense is intended by Moses in Deuteronomy 28:49, by Jeremiah in Jer 4:13 and Lamentations 4:19 (directly naming Babylon), and Ezekiel. In Ezekiel 17 there are two eagles and two exiles. The second is more devastating than the first, making the first eagle Babylon and the second eagle Rome. Yet none of those passages is as haunting as Micah. *“Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair, for the children of your delight; make yourselves as bald as **the eagle**, for they shall go from you into exile.”* (Micah 1:16 ESV). When the eagles carried them off, the Jews lost house and field, temple and nation. All they had left were their families.
  - *The snake* is tricky. Hezekiah in 2 Kings 18:4 destroyed Nehushtan, the snake Moses made, for the people now regarded it as an idol. Hezekiah is the one Isaiah alludes to in 14:29, saying *“Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that **snake** will spring up a **viper**, its fruit will be a darting, **venomous serpent**.”* Ahaz was the snake whom the Philistines did not fear, but his son Hezekiah, was a viper, wise and cunning. That is the good news interpretation. For the bad news, we have this: *“‘For behold, I am sending among you serpents, adders that cannot be charmed, and they shall bite you,’ declares the Lord.”* (Jeremiah 8:17) This fits better, because it describes the destruction that comes in the midst of the exile, hence follows the eagle chronologically.
  - *The ship* on the sea could refer to Jonah, who tried to flee God by ship to Tarshish, whose identification is uncertain, but may be Sardinia, due to the kind of silver found there. It represents a reluctant missionary event. However, Isaiah prophesied the destruction of Tyre (in Isaiah 23), saying “Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste.” Tarshish and Tyre were both Phoenician holdings. The association of Tyre and “the way of a ship on the high seas” in Proverbs 30 is made clearer by this prophecy:
  
#### Thus says the Lord,
##### your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:"
#### "For your sake I send to Babylon
#### and bring them all down as fugitives,
##### even the Chaldeans,
##### in the ships in which they rejoice.
#### I am the Lord, your Holy One,
##### the Creator of Israel, your King.”
#### Thus says the Lord,
##### who makes a way in the sea,
##### a path in the mighty waters…
###### - Isaiah 43:14–16

  Thus Isaiah has interpreted the Proverb as speaking about a naval battle, blockade and siege. The siege of Tyre lasted 13 years and began in 586 BC, the year the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed. Thus this follows in sequence the initial exile of the people (the eagle) and the destruction of city and temple (the snake).

  - *The maiden (or virgin)* is the final element of the riddle. Surely this refers to Queen Esther, who mastered the art of how a woman must behave around a merciless and hot-tempered king and so saved the Jews from genocide. The way of a man with this maid went her way.

Thus the five elements of the riddle begin with a single
man (Elijah) and end with a single woman (Esther). They
describe a long war leading through exile and destruction
to a respite of peace. The prophets matched the elements,
one by one, through a series of prophecies. Now we must
do the same for the church.

  - **The raven** is a symbol of God’s provision. There is an ancient story about Saint Anthony, one of the Desert Fathers and an early practitioner of the monastic life. Anthony lived in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries, during the first missionary era. In his biography of Anthony, Athanasius reported that a raven often brought Anthony half a loaf of bread, but when he had a visitor, Paul of Thebes, the raven brought a whole loaf. This account of Anthony was popular reading among Christians for over a thousand years and firmly established the raven as a positive symbol among Christians.

  - **The eagle in the sky** was Rome, whose legions marched behind an eagle as their standard. This second missionary era began when the Roman Empire became a Christian empire in 380 AD.

  - **The snake on the rock** matches the era when the church expanded by land (over rock), up to Russia and Poland in the east and northern Europe and England in the west. During this third missionary era, Satan remained bound, but the Islamic empire captured Jerusalem and built the Dome of the Rock, which includes an inscription rejects the possibility that God has a Son. This era would end when the snake got free.

  - **The ship on the high seas** symbolizes the age of exploration. During this fourth missionary era, Portugal, Spain and other Christian kingdoms spread the faith to the New World by sea.

  - **The way of a man with a maid** (or virgin) goes with the fifth and final missionary age. In this era, women began to emerge from constrained lives. Like Queen Esther, they helped spread the message of salvation to the world.

This parable also makes reference to the four elements.
Set aside the raven, which is not part of the quartet and you
have the eagle’s sky for **air**, the snake’s rock for **earth**, the
ship’s sea for **water**, and the maiden for **fire**, because
*“Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?”* (Proverbs 6:27, NIV). 
This association helps explain the contrast between the first three items. The
phrasing *“Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand”* 
implies that all four items are similar, but the
fourth stands out. How is the fourth different from the
preceding three?

The fourth analogy is not about searching for food or
trading opportunities. It is about love. This era falls during
the life phase of **Amity**, for relationships. This era is
experiencing radical changes in how human relationships
are structured (some good, some bad). We know the
history of the last few centuries is unprecedented. The
biggest difference is the enhanced participation of women.
If Esther saved all the Jews and she is Israel’s fulfillment of
the final analogy, what will Christian women do?

**Promotion**. Within any army, you need to identify
capable soldiers to elevate to positions of greater
responsibility. Existing leaders must train their troops in
martial skills and character and observe them. Soldiers, on
the other hand, must keep their eyes open for
opportunities to advance. This fifth life phase is all about
exploiting **opportunities** and material possessions to grow
and prosper. The parable is about the perils that attend this
process.

#### Under three things the earth trembles;
#### under four it cannot bear up:
#### **a slave** when he becomes king,
#### and **a fool** when he is filled with food;
#### an **unloved woman** when she gets a husband,
#### and a **maidservant** when she displaces her mistress.
###### - (30:21-23)

History is full of examples of people who rose from
slavery to authority. Some were disasters. Others (like
Joseph) acquitted themselves admirably. The Bible has
examples of unloved wives, like Jacob’s Leah and usurping
maidservants, like Hagar tried with Sarah. However, when
these verses are applied to Christian history, they more
refer to massive social changes, not individuals. Strikingly,
each analogy matches one of Solomon’s times.

*Serfdom (960–1080 AD).* This era saw a rapid decline
in the practice of slavery in England and on the
continent. It was replaced with the institution of
serfdom. The improvement in status may look
infinitesimal in our eyes, but serfs possessed many
civil rights that slaves did not. Philosophically and
legally, they were now people, not property. They
were no longer “animals with voices” as the Greeks
once taught. Serfs could inherit land.
Improvements that they made to their holdings
remained theirs to exploit, encouraging greater
industriousness. This would become evident during
the next time.

*Fools with food (1080–1200 AD).* The Medieval Warm
Period and improvements in agricultural
technology, motivation for serfs to improve their
land where slaves would not have, and
Christianization of the Vikings changed Europe.
Grain yields and population doubled, life
expectancy lengthened by ten years, and the added
wealth bestowed power upon the fools of Northern
Europe.

*The unloved women of the Cathars (1200–1320 AD).*
The Albigensian Crusade destroyed the Cathars,
which had great appeal to women on account of its
teaching and practice of equality. These women
were accomplished heretics and suffered the
ultimate penalty.

*The maidservant (1320–1440 AD).* At last we reach an
individual. Joan of Arc was called “the maid of
Orleans”. Detractors jealous of her power and
influence conspired for her to be tried and
executed. In addition, due to the Black Death, poor
women displaced men in many trades, because
there were not enough men left alive to perform
them. When the demographic imbalance was
rectified, those in power clawed back many of the
freedoms women had acquired during this brief
period.

New legal rights, more plentiful food, and vacancies in
society conspired to give women and the poor new
opportunities, which advanced civilization and set the stage
for the next act.

**Tactics.** We come at last to military tactics, when the
army takes the field and begins to advance towards its goal.
This sixth era is the life phase of **Community**. It involves
forming and breaking alliances and each analogy
corresponds to a different one of Solomon’s times.

#### Four things on earth are small,
##### but they are exceedingly wise:
#### **the ants** are a people not strong,
##### yet they provide their food in the summer;
#### **the rock badgers** are a people not mighty,
##### yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
#### **the locusts** have no king,
##### yet all of them march in rank;
#### **the lizard** you can take in your hands,
##### yet it is in kings' palaces. 
###### - (30:24-28)

  - *The ants (1440–1560 AD)*. The ants are masters at **logistics**. An army marches on its stomach. During this era, the European Colonial Empires conquered the New World and expanded in other areas. They improved sea transport, obtained gold, silver, and many new foods, like potatoes and corn.

  - *The rock badgers (1560–1680 AD)*. The hyrax or rock badger can hide in crevasses, so this is about finding **shelter**. Maintaining billets for soldiers in advanced positions with food, water, and protection from the cold is essential, as Napoleon learned when the Russian winter destroyed his Grand Armee. In this era, it was Pilgrims, Anabaptists and other nonconformists fleeing persecution who voyaged to the New World. They were not mighty people – but they became so!

  - *The locusts (1680–1800 AD)*. The locusts have a common **purpose** and enviable **discipline**. This *esprit de corps* was Christian civilization. The locusts (as developed previously) were the European Colonial empires in their most expansive phase, acting just like locusts. The Kings and Queens of the British Empire did not say, “Let’s conquer Afghanistan today.” Instead, English traders, teachers, doctors, and missionaries traveled out from the British Isles to pursue their private though interlocking goals. When they got in trouble, they called for help and the Royal Navy showed up with an expeditionary force. Next thing you know, England has another colony. Today, people in academia as well as the general public loath colonialism. God was blunt. He told us long ago, “This is how I am am going to get the job done. These empires will come like locusts, eat as much as they can (stripping countries of their resources), and then leave. And they will accomplish what I intend. In my name, they will destroy all the nations, for all the nations have blasphemed my name.” Does this horrify you? It should. That was the reaction of Habakkuk and other prophets, who tried to talk God out of his plans. This emotion of horror is our spirit rebelling against the truth that our sins are so vile that God is justified in doing this.

  - *The lizard (1800–1920 AD)*. How do you invade a castle? You can bombard the walls with cannon, or you can dig a tunnel, bribe an official to identify a weakness, or sneak a spy in to open the gates. Christendom’s **siege engineers and spies** were its missionaries, who converted people to a new worldview with a new allegiance – to Christ and his church. Also, the spread of democracy undermined the philosophical basis for monarchies. During this era, many kingdoms fell and few remain today. There was a wholesale revolution in leadership.

**Leadership.** The life phase for this era is loyalty, a
fitting companion to leadership. This seventh and final
parable is a reprise of the history of the great empires, with
maybe a hint of what is yet to come.

#### Three things are stately in their tread;
#### four are stately in their stride:
#### the **lion**, which is mightiest among beasts
#### and does not turn back before any;
#### the **strutting rooster**,
#### the **he-goat**,
#### and **a king** whose army is with him. 
###### - (30:29-31)

Thanks to the prophets, the same empires are associated
with multiple animals. Recall Daniel’s prophecies. From
Daniel 7, the lion is Babylon and from Daniel 8, the goat is
Greece. If this progression is Daniel’s four empire
progression, then the strutting rooster must be Medo-
Persia. It turns out that the rooster was an important
symbol in Persia and the Greeks and Romans claim that
chickens originally came to their nations from Persia. There
is also the tradition among the Greeks that lions are afraid
of roosters. This makes sense, since the rooster (Medo-
Persia) overthrew the lion (Babylon). This just leaves the
final image of a king instead of another animal. So we have
three animal and one human allegory. This fits with the
formula of three things that are more like each other than
the fourth. This means that the fourth empire will be more
sophisticated and seem more civilized than the three that
proceeded it. Rome and its offshoots which constitute
European civilization fit that bill. That very sophistication
will be the thing to lure people to their destruction.

Can we match the animals to the final four times, of
love, hate, war and peace? The final image makes the most
sense. Satan will have his army about him, but so will the
Lord. Jesus will return with all the saints at his side, his
heroes of faith. Then the battle will be over and the final
victory won.
