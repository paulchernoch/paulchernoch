## Thunders

In “Aftertaste: Donner & Blitzen”, many connections between thunder passages in Psalms, Job, Exodus and
Revelation were enumerated. Now that we have identified Exodus as part of the floor of Lady Wisdom’s house, we see
that this connection via the thunders helps secure the pillars to that floor. 
(Bits and pieces of that chapter are covered [with the theme of songs](./theme-of-songs.html) and in [riddles](./riddles.html). The whole of this very long chapter with much more about the seven thunders may be found in [Seven Thunders](./seven-thunders.html))

An extra connection is to Jeremiah.

#### “‘The LORD will **roar** from on high;
##### he will **thunder** from his holy dwelling
###### and **roar mightily** against his land.
#### He will **shout** like those who tread the grapes,
##### **shout** against all who live on the earth.
#### The **tumult will resound** to the ends of the earth,
##### for the LORD will **bring charges** against the nations;
#### he will bring judgment on all mankind
##### and put the wicked to the **sword**,’ ”
#### declares the LORD.
#### This is what the LORD Almighty says:
##### “Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation;
###### a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”
###### - Jeremiah 25:30-32

Jeremiah gives seven analogies for God speaking: roar,
thunder, roar mightily, shout, shout and bring charges. The
inclusion of thunder and the seven analogies suggests the
seven thunders. The mention of a sword connects to the
seven swords. (The rest of the chapter has two more mentions of swords.)

The interested reader might also compare these passages which connect the seven pillars extensively:

  - Psalm 18:4-10 to Revelation 1:7,17-18; 10:1
  - Psalm 18:28 to Job 17:11-12
  - Psalm 29:1-2 to Revelation 4:8
  - Psalm 68:5-6,19-20,29-30,32-33 to Revelation 6:15; 7:10; 13:11-12 to Job 40:15-24
  - Psalm 77:6-7,16-20 to Job 35:9-11; 9:5-11
  - Psalm 77:11-12 to Revelation 11:5-6
  - Psalm 81:7 to Exodus 17;6-7 and Numbers 20:11-13
  - Psalm 81:8-9 to Revelation 13:4,8,12
  - Psalm 104:4-5 to Revelation 16:18-20
  - Psalm 104:6-18 to Revelation 21:6 to Job 38:39-39:30
  - Psalm 104:24-26 to Revelation 13:1-3; 18:17-18; 19:20 to Job 41
  - Revelation 10:5-7 to Exodus 19:16-19
  - Revelation 15:3 to Exodus 15:1-18; 31:30; 32:1-34
  - Revelation 9:1,7-11 to Job 39:24-25
  - Many plagues of Revelation to Exodus 7-12

At last, we return to the rainbow which in Ezekiel was
also associated with a vision of the Lord. Revelation 10 not
only includes a reference to pillars but ties together pillars
from the rest of the Bible, the seven thunders, the seven
spirits and the theme of Books.

        In Genesis 28, Jacob saw angels descending a
        ladder, coming down from heaven. In both Genesis
        28 & 31, he erects a pillar as a token of his worship
        of God. To signify the spirit of Lordship, God says
        to Jacob, <i>“I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac.”</i> (Genesis 28:13)

        Revelation 4:3 said, <i>“around the throne was a rainbow”</i>. 
        That scene describes worship, which
        flows from the spirit of understanding, and also
        declares the existence of the seven spirits of God.
        Ezekiel 1:26-28 uses similar imagery, also including
        the rainbow.

        At Jesus’ Transfiguration in Matthew 17:2, as he
        took counsel with Moses & Elijah, he shone like the
        sun. Then in Rev 1:15-16, his face shining like the
        sun is paired with "his feet were like burnished
        bronze".

        The spirit of might was manifest by the pillar of fire

        7:21 from Solomon’s temple that stand for “in him
        is strength” & “he is established”. 
        <br/>
        Revelation mentions pillars in another significant
        passage, a fantastic promise: 
        <i>"The one who conquers, I will make him a <b>pillar</b> in the temple of my God.
        Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God."</i> (3:12)

        Revelation is dominated by the appearance and
        unsealing of a scroll, representing detailed
        knowledge of the future. According to Revelation
        3:12 quoted above, we become God's scroll and
        pillar when on us he writes “the name of [his] God”.

        And he set his right foot on the sea, <br/>

        When he called out, <br/>
        the <b>seven thunders</b> sounded. <br/>
        And when the <b>seven thunders</b> had sounded, <br/>
        I was about to write, but I heard a voice <br/>

        “Seal up what the <b>seven thunders</b> have said, <br/>
        and do not write it down.”

    <td>
        The roars of lion and thunder inspire the fear of the
        Lord, the last of the seven spirits of God. In this
        final verse, the legs of the angel are the pillars,
        subduing the peoples of the earth.

        The Old Testament pillar reference this evokes is
        mysterious. It is Song of Songs 4, where the Lover
        (Christ) likens his Bride to a tower. The voice from
        heaven in Revelation 10 says to seal up what the
        seven thunders have said. In Song of Songs, it is the
        Bride’s garden that is sealed, “a garden locked is my
        sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.”
        (SS 4:12)

        What is the greatest mystery that the seven thunders
        conceal? A lover’s secret!

The pillar reference of Revelation 10 adds to our
knowledge of what the seven thunders said. They explained
the deepest truth of God’s wisdom and their seven pillars.
