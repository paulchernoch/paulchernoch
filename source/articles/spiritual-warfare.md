title: Spiritual Warfare
quote: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, <br/> but against... the spiritual forces of evil <br/> in the heavenly realms. <br/> - Ephesians 6:12ac

The problem with the topic of spiritual warfare is not that it is difficult to find useful, understandable 
guidance on the subject in the Bible. The problem is that there is so much! As for this author, the problem
is not that I have had few experiences useable as illustrations of the principles. My life is filled
with examples of success and failure in this area.

In progress...
