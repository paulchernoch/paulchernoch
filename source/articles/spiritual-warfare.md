## What is Spiritual Warfare?

The problem with the topic of spiritual warfare is not that it is difficult to find useful, understandable 
guidance on the subject in the Bible. The problem is that there is so much! That is not the only problem.
When you are under siege, logic and proportion vanish. Crises bring pain, impatience, shortcuts, and despair.
They drain you of energy and wreck your plans. Paranoia or shame separate you from the friends you need to
help you get through. Hearing an argument put forth and defended point by point will not do.
Even if you agreed that the ideas are sound, the ability to put them into practice is not there.

Where does that leave Biblical principles? Are they robbed of their power? No! We must take our cue from Solomon.
It is a matter of the right time.

  - The right time to learn Biblical principles on how to prevail in a spiritual battle is before the crisis begins.
  - The right person to apply the principles is often not you the sufferer but a fellow Christian walking on stable ground who comes up alongside you.
  - The right words from the Bible for the moment may come to you mysteriously and they may not even make sense, but they don't have to make sense for them to begin the healing process. They just have to make sense to the Holy Spirit who is administering them.
  - When the first three are not an option, faith in the love of the invisible God can sustain us when we have no support.

It is possible to learn new truths and put them into practice even while under fire. In [Dreams](./dreams.html) I share how I was delivered from
persistent nightmares through prayer and meditation on the Psalms and Isaiah, guided to the verses I needed by God's grace.
Be grateful when such things happen to you. In my experience, such victories are rare. Take your swimming lessons before you board leaky boats.

The first lesson is NOT to answer the question, "What is Spiritual Warfare?" The first lesson is to define what is Spiritual Growth.
Spiritual Growth is what the one who is warring against your soul hopes to stop. Once you know what that second thing is,
the first will make more sense. The starting point is the Great Commandment:

#### And one of the scribes came up and heard them
#### disputing with one another, and seeing that 
#### he answered them well, asked him,
##### “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
#### Jesus answered,
##### “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, 
##### the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God
##### with all your **heart** and with all your soul 
##### and with all your **mind** and with all your **strength**.’
##### The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 
##### There is no other commandment greater than these.”
#### And the scribe said to him,
##### “You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one,
##### and there is no other besides him. And to love him with
##### all the **heart** and with all the **understanding** 
##### and with all the **strength**, and to love one's neighbor as oneself,
##### is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
#### And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him,
##### “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”
#### And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions.
###### - Mark 12:28-34

Perhaps those people did not dare to ask Jesus any more questions, but I do often.
Yesterday I stepped back from the rough outline for this article and knew it was lacking something.
I prayed for the wisdom to have something valuable to share with any who read these words.
I wrote a few paragraphs more and then set it aside. This morning I had my answer. It was the law of love.
That is what spiritual growth is.

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>Spiritual Growth is growing in our love</p>
  <p>for God and for each other</p>
  <p>with every part of our being.</p>
</div>

It is to grow in our **mind**, in the apprehension and embracing of what is true and lovely and good 
and the overflow of that truth into our speech.

It is to grow in our **heart**, in treasuring the things that God treasures, 
submitting our emotions to faith in God's provision, and having passion for
justice and mercy - with humility. It is receiving wise counsel and sharing it with others.

It is to grow in our **strength**, devoting our hands to good works, training them in good habits
and focusing our time and energy on noble things, not dissipating it on foolish pursuits.

(I lump the soul in with the heart because I have a hard time dividing them. Hebrews 4:12 says 
the word of God is "Sharper than any double-edged sword" and "it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit".
It knows how to do that, but I do not.)

Knowing what Spiritual Growth is, we can now define Spiritual Warfare:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>Spiritual Warfare is resisting every</p>
  <p>influence directed at us to</p>
  <p>kill, reverse or stunt our Spiritual Growth.</p>
</div>

For our soul's enemies, Spiritual Warfare includes everything that tries to make humans hate God and each other.
These enemies attack every part of a person: heart, mind and strength.
These enemies attack people at every phase of their life.
They have separate tactics for each.

For our soul's allies, Spiritual Warfare includes everything that tries to make humans love God and each other.
In the words of Paul, "Love always protects."
That protection must shield the whole person: heart, mind and strength.
That protection must persist across the whole of a person's life.

With the clarity of knowing what is at stake and what is the prize for those who win the victory,
we can proceed to the details.

## Get to Know Your Ally First

Dangerous ideas have long circulated that distract from assembling the best spiritual defense. I do not know if they are entirely wrong,
but they put the focus in the wrong place. Before putting forth some good ideas about how to defend yourself against the enemy,
let us push aside some bad ones. Paul said that knowledge puffs up. There is a sort of knowledge that seems indispensable when it comes
to battling demons. It is not.

If you suspect that a friend or acquaintance is possessed by a demon or that they or you are oppressed by one, what do you need to know?
Some people teach that you need to learn the demon's name in order to cast it out. To get it, you pray over the afflicted person
charging the demon in Christ's name to speak and reveal its identity. Then with that knowledge, you can effectively pray for it to be cast out.
When I was a new Christian, this idea seemed sensible. I was not yet well acquainted with the story of Job. The way that the
story is framed, there is no evidence that during his trials Job knew of the existence of Satan. He certainly had no clue that it was 
Satan who was afflicting him. His sole focus was on God. That faith sustained him and enabled him to prevail. In like fashion,
we do not need to know who or what is afflicting us. Is it a demon? A jealous colleague? A criminal living down the street?
A communicable disease? Your own sin? God is stronger than all of them and I see nowhere in Scripture that a person is faulted 
for being ignorant about the nature of a demon. Yes, Jesus does ask one demon-possessed man, "What is your name?" (Luke 8:30)
The answer to that question had meaning to Jesus, who as the Son of God knows all things and therefore the identities of all demons.
If we ask such a question and are answered, of what use is it to us? We do not know where to send it, or what is its assigned place or 
assigned time for judgment. Jesus' normal practice was to not listen to the demons at all, but to shut them up! (Luke 4:33-37)

Spend your time getting to know Jesus by meditating on his Word. Abide in the Spirit. Pray to the Father. God has all the knowledge
He needs to deal with your problem. The only deviation from this is when Jesus told his disciples that to cast out a certain demon,
in addition to praying they needed also to fast. Is fasting a means of communicating with Satan? No! It is one of the means we are
taught to communicate with God. So whatever the problem is, the answer is to spend more and deeper time in prayer, praise and worship of God.

Another idea is that there are territorial spirits. We must identify them and pray against them that the territory, 
whether a city, region, nation or empire, be freed from their grip and the Holy Spirit take charge. 
The Book of Daniel is cited for this. Daniel prayed and fasted for weeks before he received an answer to his petition. 
(Daniel 10:12-13) The angel told him that he was resisted by the "prince of the Persian kingdom", causing the delay. 
Many think that this prince was a fallen angel. It seems probable that every nation or at least great earthly empire 
has standing behind it such an angel, whether good or evil. While Paul in Ephesians tells us that we are battling 
against principalities in the heavenly realms, how does he advise us? We are to pray for kings and 
all who rule over us. Them we can see. Them we can pray for. Them we can resist if they command evil. 
As we move in faith in this world, our actions have an impact in the other world but we are not to become preoccupied with that.

Lest someone accuse me of dismissing an important idea in ignorance, I will say this. When I went to Romania in Summer 1991
on a short term mission trip, as soon as I crossed the border I felt something. The nation "felt" different from any place
I had ever been. After leaving Hungary, I felt like the spiritual atmosphere over Romania was purer. I knew God was up to 
something in that place. Two years earlier, I had felt an urgent pull, drawing me irresistibly to study Eastern Europe. 
In my spirit I felt that something huge was happening in the world, but I didn't know what. It was Summer 1989. I attended a 
missions conference in July 1989 and heard a Romanian exile named Joseph Tson speak. He prophesied that Communism was 
about to fall. I was electrified. That Fall it happened exactly as he said. For months I had felt God applying 
massive spiritual force to the world. He was preparing to topple many nations, but I knew it not. I bet each nation had its own 
angel in charge. It didn't matter. They all lost their foothold, but not because church people learned a bunch of 
demon's names and said special prayers. No, Christians had been crying out to God for relief for decades and he answered. 
That is where you look, at the Father, not at the enemy. Despite the powerful feelings I had during those years and how 
well they lined up with the idea of territorial spirits, I have never found any use for that knowledge that could improve 
how I pray or act.

What use was it then? The visceral sense of such things caused me to marvel at God for showing me a glimpse of the 
great things He was doing. It gave me the insight to understand that God does judge nations and topple empires, just like
he promised. It helped me trust ancient prophecies about God's plans. That certainty helped me persevere through years 
of Bible study and writing when so much didn't make sense. If the Lord can overthrow a beastly empire like Communist Russia 
in a season, is there anything He cannot do?

## Dimensions to Spiritual Warfare

The starting point for victory in spiritual warfare is not knowledge, it is the humble admission of ignorance, emptiness, 
and powerlessness. The person who admits their need and turns to God for help has taken the first step in
acquiring an educated mind, a stout heart and arms strong for the the task of opposing evil and building what is good.
In the Spring of 1985, I was conversing with a believer about the Bible. He told me that he was impressed by my 
Bible knowledge. I said to him, "Yes, I have read the Bible, but I don't understand it." Weeks later I became a Christian.
My admission of ignorance was one of the factors that enabled me to be saved.

Later that year, filled with anxiety about my studies, fear about my future and in a general state of depression, 
I cried out to God, "Jesus, I still don't know if you exist, but if you don't there is no hope for my life." 
I resolved to place all my hope in Jesus because I knew of no other place to turn. In response, God began to heal 
and strengthen my emotional core.

As for strength and direction in life, hours after my desperate prayer, the Lord gave me an idea for my bachelors thesis,
then the perseverance to spend the next twenty months completing it. That thesis led directly to my first job out of college,
which proved to be an excellent start for my career as a software engineer.

A sure **mind**, a steady **heart** and a guided and disciplined **hand**. Those are the three broad areas of life that God assisted me 
with during my first year as a Christian. I can understand those categories now and see how they surface all over the Bible
and all over my life, but at the beginning I knew nothing of such things. The rest of this article will not tell you how to
fight the battle. It will tell you how to see it.

Lots of wise Christians have put forth useful ideas about spiritual growth. They shape what they have learned into logical forms.
Some of those forms are of their own invention and some are taken straight from the Bible. My preference is to propose
categories and processes defined in the Bible. That helps me guard against adding something beyond what God has said 
or leaving out something vital. I trust the Bible to cover topics as completely as God intended; I do not trust myself to do the same. 

What are these categories, these lists of love that the Lord has lavished upon us? Here are the ones that I have discovered.
Many are not original with me - which is a good thing!

  - The three parts of a person: Mind, Heart and Hand
  - The three spheres of hostility: the Devil, the World and the Flesh
  - The three forces of temptation: Fraud, Fear and Focus
  - The three allies of faith: Jesus, the Holy Spirit and the Father
  - The three levels of growth: Material Growth, Individual Spiritual Growth, Collective Church Growth
  - [The Three Kinds of Heavenly Treasures](./heavenly-treasures.html): for Establishing, Nourishing, and Flourishing
  - [The Spiritual Disciplines](./talk-to-god.html)
  - [The Five Voices to ignore](./proverbs-20-to-29.html) : the fools, the sluggards, the quarrelsome, the malicious, the flatterers
  - [The Five Battlefields](./riddles-of-war.html): the individual, the workplace, the family, the church, the state
  - [The Sevenfold Path to a Spiritual Harvest](./harvest-pattern.html): Preparation, Plowing, Planting, Pouring, Plucking, Producing, Peace
  - [The Seven Phases of Spiritual Growth](./growth-pattern.html): Security, Ability, Stability, Amity, Opportunity, Community, Loyalty
  - [The Seven Spirits of God](./seven-spirits.html): Lordship, Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Might, Knowledge, Fear of the Lord
  - [The Seven Pillars of Wisdom](./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html)
  - [The Law of Christ](./law-pattern.html)
  - The Whole Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20)

Each of these ways of slicing the spiritual world gives you insight into another facet of the problem.
Some are diagnostic of your current state while others plot out a course for you to follow to progress towards maturity and peace.
This article will introduce them, some in groups and some alone. Many are explored in detail in other articles on this website.
If the complexity appears daunting, reflect on Jesus' words:

#### And he said,
##### “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed
##### on the ground. He sleeps and rises night and day,
##### and the seed sprouts and grows; **he knows not how**. 
##### The earth produces by itself, first the blade, 
##### then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
##### But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle,
##### because the harvest has come.”
###### - Mark 4:26-29

The Word of God is infinitely complex, designed by the Creator of the Universe, yet we do not need to understand
all that complexity for it to sprout within us and produce a harvest. It is like your doctor prescribing a pill.
Do you know its chemical formula? How it was manufactured? How it interacts with the different systems of your body?
How it targets your ailment? How your body eliminates it when it is no longer needed? No, you just need to trust
your doctor, your pharmacist and the factory that made the pill. You need to trust them, pour a glass of water,
and swallow. Yet if you work for the pharmaceutical company designing an improvement to the drug, you need to know these things.
If you are the doctor, you need to know the side effects and the characteristics that indicate whether that drug
or another will be better for a given patient. And if you are a mature Christian, you need to learn these things if
you are to mentor younger people.

When we are infants in the faith, the Lord cares for us like babes. We are short on knowledge and lean on our faith
and the assistance of others. Months after I became a Christian, another believer pointed me to a sound Bible study; 
her advice spared me from joining a pseudo-Christian cult. Then when my new Bible study leader visited churches, 
I tagged along and ended up at a good one. As we grow older, the Lord steps back. We are expected to grow in maturity 
and proactively pursue knowledge, just like parents step back when their children become adults.
In the sections that follow, I show a few of the things that I have learned related to spiritual warfare.
The most important is that this warfare is permitted by God to help us grow. The crises in my life taught
me how to distinguish between the voice of God and the voice of the enemy. Without "a time for war", you will never be prepared
to enter into the "time for peace".

## Temptation, Treasure and Lots of Threes

Spiritual conflict often begins with a temptation. One goal that God has for our spiritual growth is to break the power of 
temptations that once ruled over us and ruined us so that we may be free from sin and full of good fruit.
How do you regard temptation? I grudgingly admit that it is a teacher. When we are drawn to a harmful thing it tempts us 
because we desire it. When we are chased away from a good thing, we comply because we desire pleasure and 
holding fast to that good has been made painful by persecution or some other form of hardship. When we fail such a test,
our values are clarified. We discover what is important to us and what we merely give lip service to. Temptation is
a harsh teacher.

Reflecting on the stories of temptation in the Bible was the first exercise that enabled me to discover the Harvest Pattern of Jesus.
Succumbing to temptation is the opposite of gathering a harvest. You learn useful things from negative lessons, but they are incomplete.

A second exercise was meditating on the Parable of the Soils (Matthew 13:21-23). That parable describes three ways in which people fail, 
each a different kind of temptation. I wrestled for years to understand that parable. Consider how important Jesus regarded it:

#### And he said to them,
##### 'Do you not understand this parable? 
##### How then will you understand all the parables?'
##### - Mark 4:13, ESV

The NIV amplifies the importance by saying "understand **any** parable". I put my understanding alongside Jesus' declaration and they didn't
line up. The meaning that I could see did not justify the extreme - even paramount - importance attached to it. That told me that I
was missing something big.

The third exercise was reflecting on the spiritual struggles in which I was victorious. These include victories over 
the fear of death, aimlessness, nightmares, depression, and anxiety. Each time we overcome a temptation, weakness, or character flaw 
of any kind we reap a new harvest of righteousness. By introspection and prayer, I discovered a pattern to my victories that had escaped me
and that pattern matched one found in the Bible. This was a new proof to me of the truth of the Bible's ideas.

The central stories of temptation are the three times that Satan speaks openly: to Eve (in Genesis 3), to the Father (concerning Job in Job 1-2), 
and to Jesus (when he was tempted in the desert in Matthew 4). (A fourth story is the testing of Peter. We do not hear Satan's words directly, 
merely that he wanted to "sift \[him\] like wheat" (Luke 22:31).) These three stories are compared and contrasted in "Three Appointments with Satan" 
in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. An early result of studying them was discovering the first three threes, which govern:

  - our personality
  - the enemy's tactics
  - the vectors of hostility

**Personality**. Models for describing human personality abound. The one Jesus employed was simple; it has just three parts:

  - the mind (including speech and intellect)
  - the heart (including emotions and desires)
  - the hand (including habits, plans, goals and actions in the physical realm)

These are the three areas we need to grow, consequently these are the areas that Satan attacks. 
Satan attacked Eve in all three, and Job, and Jesus. Let's start by looking at Eve:

#### “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 
#### “For God knows that when you eat from it
#### your eyes will be opened, and you
#### will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
#### When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree
##### was **good for food** and
##### **pleasing to the eye**, 
##### and also **desirable for gaining wisdom**, 
#### she took some and ate it.
#### She also gave some to her husband, 
#### who was with her, and he ate it.
###### - Genesis 3:4-6, NIV

Satan tempted Eve with three lies, each directed at a different part of her person.
She then accepted each of the three lies and all three parts of her person
(and her husband's) were harmed.

  1. “You will not certainly die" is a lie about the effect on her physical body, saying it won't harm her strength. Eve's response is to accept that it was "good for food", meaning it will strengthen her body.
  2. "Your eyes will be opened" is a lie about the effect on her heart. Her spiritual eyes were darkened and unholy desires entered her heart. Eve's response was to admire the fruit as "pleasing to the eye". Our heart's desires are a fertile battleground for Satan.
  3. "You will be like God, knowing good and evil" is a lie about what true wisdom is and how we are to pursue it. Eve then trusted Satan's evaluation that the fruit was "desirable for gaining wisdom". This final assault was against her mind, to believe a lie.

With Job, Satan did not speak to Job directly, because Job was wise about God's words. Instead of leading with lies (the realm of the mind), Satan
softened him up with attacks on his strength (in chapter 1 by killing his beloved children, his servants and stealing his wealth) and his heart 
(in chapter 2 by afflicting him with disease, nightmares and rejection by wife, friends and family). Only then did he invade the dreams of one of his friends to 
introduce religious lies to attack Job's character and faith. Thus the order of attack was: Job's strength (his hand), his heart and then his mind.
This is the same order that showed up in the story of Eve.

Unlike Eve, Job was victorious. God withdrew his hedge of protection from Job temporarily to allow Satan's attacks, then 
restored it piece by piece. The protection was restored in three phases, one for each facet of Job's being.

  1. During the speeches in which Job argued with his friends, God poured wisdom into the man's mind. We know this, because at the end of the book, God endorses the things that Job said.
  2. When Elihu enters the scene, he offers Job emotional support, sides with Job against the words of his three friends, and gives wise counsel and promises that God loves him.
  3. When God arrives in the Whirlwind, He speaks about how he provides physical assistance to the animals, like food, freedom and assistance with bearing young. Then he restores Job's health, fortune and relationships.

Thus the victory was won in reverse order: the mind, the heart, and the body. This order is critical. 
It matches the order given in the Parable of the Soils. Temptation and destruction are a harvest in reverse.

Jesus faced the same categories of temptation in the same order, but did not respond in kind.

#### Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness 
#### to be tempted by the devil. And after fasting forty days 
#### and forty nights, **he was hungry**. And the tempter came 
#### and said to him, 
##### “If you are the Son of God, **command these stones** 
##### to become loaves of bread.”
#### But he answered, 
##### “It is written,
##### “‘Man shall not live by bread alone,
##### but by **every word** that comes from the mouth of God.’”
#### Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him 
#### on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, 
##### **“If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down**, 
##### for it is written,
###### “‘He will command his angels concerning you,’
##### and
###### “‘On their hands they will bear you up,
###### lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
#### Jesus said to him, 
##### “Again it is written, 
###### **‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test**.’”
#### Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain 
#### and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
#### And he said to him, 
##### “All these I will give you, 
##### if you will **fall down and worship me**.”
#### Then Jesus said to him, 
##### “Be gone, Satan! For it is written,
###### “‘You shall worship the Lord your God
###### and **him only shall you serve**.’”
#### Then the devil left him, and behold, 
#### angels came and were ministering to him.
###### - Matthew 4:1-11

**Tactics: The Three Forces of Temptation**. The devil's attack was standard:

  - Against the body: hunger to tempt Jesus to pursue bread for strength
  - Against the heart: accusation to get Jesus to doubt God is his Father and can protect him
  - Against the mind: bribe to get Jesus to reject the central truth that only the Lord God is to be worshiped

This brings out Satan's tactics, the three forces that he applies to destroy us:

  - **Fraud**: Satan lies to us
  - **Fear**: Satan bullies us with persecution or hardship
  - **Focus**: Satan distracts us with shiny things that make us leave the path and focus our strength on everything but what we should be doing

Jesus' response was not standard. On every point he responded with an appeal to the Word.
On every point he followed the path of growth.

  - Instead of feeding his bodily appetite, Jesus feeds his **mind** on "every word that comes from the mouth of God"
  - Instead of succumbing to fear, Jesus derives his confidence and maintains a steady **heart** by trusting in the Word
  - Instead of being distracted by a bribe from his course, he sets his **hand** on worshiping God and living by God's timetable

Note that by his temptations, Satan tries to get us to prioritize our bodily needs first, then our feelings, 
and only last worry about the truth. Jesus' responds first with truth, then steadies his heart with that truth,
then obeys that truth by committing his actions - his hands - to working for and worshiping God.
Make your appetites serve the truth instead of bending the truth to satisfy your appetites.

**The Three Spheres of Hostility**. Our enemies may be divided into three camps:

  - The devil (and all malicious spiritual entities)
  - The world (all individuals and groups of people hostile to God)
  - The flesh (our sinful nature, the enemy within)

We already dealt with Satan's role in temptation, here is the world's:

#### For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, 
#### the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—
#### comes not from the Father but from the **world**.
###### - 1 John 2:16

Much of the Bible is devoted to the world system and its evils. Space does not permit us to 
repeat it. We mention it here because we must recognize our enemies if we are to at last
understand Jesus' Parable of the Soils.

**The Three Bad Soils (and one good one!)**.

After I published *Job Rises*, I sat down and tried to simplify what I had discovered into a plan for life.
I observed that the structure of Job, the unfolding of Jesus' temptation and the Parable of the Sower showed
different angles of the same underlying truth. That was the genesis of the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html). 
Since Job is a type of the suffering servant, his suffering was like Christ's suffering. Thus that much longer book amplified 
the brief tale of Jesus' temptation until even this deaf person could hear it. The parable warns of failure
but in doing so gives us the keys to success. Job is filled with negative theology and so is the parable.
By studying what can go wrong, we can find the help to ensure that it goes right.

#### That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat
#### beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him,
#### so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the 
#### whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them 
#### many things in parables, saying:
##### “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, 
##### some seeds fell **along the path**, and the **birds** came
##### and devoured them. Other seeds fell on **rocky ground**,
##### where they **did not have much soil**, and immediately 
##### they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,
##### but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since
##### they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds 
##### fell among **thorns**, and the thorns grew up and 
##### **choked them**. Other seeds fell on good soil and
##### **produced grain**, some a hundredfold, some sixty, 
##### some thirty. He who has ears, let him hear.”
###### - Matthew 13:1-9

When the Lord took away hearing in my left ear in January 2005, then gave it back,
he was telling me that I was spiritually deaf. In this parable Jesus is challenging us.
Do we have ears to hear or not? Verses later in the chapter tell us that the disciples
came to Jesus afterwards to ask him to explain what the parable meant. That is hearing.
The true hearer goes back to Jesus again and again pleading, "Please explain!"

Jesus spoke to the crowds who left after hearing wise stories and probably thinking
they understood the meaning. The disciples were humble and diligent. They asked for more.
I was once lazy, like those crowds - but I thought myself like a disciple. You see,
I passively read the report of what Jesus told his disciples and thought that qualified
me as one who kept after Jesus for more insight. No! There is no substitute for 
individually approaching Jesus in prayer, or in asking questions of pastors, or in reading
books searching for a clearer understanding. No one else can do all the work for you.

It is over a decade since I began to question Jesus about this very parable. Every few years
I revisit it and each time derive new insight. Consider the agents at war against the sower
who seeks a harvest and their tactics. Jesus told us who they are later in the chapter:

  - the bird is the *devil* and his tactic is to **trick** you out of believing the gospel by attacking the mind
  - the rocky soil is the *world* which uses suffering (like natural disasters, disease and famine) and oppression (like peer pressure and persecution) to **scare** you out of believing, attacking the heart
  - the thorny soil is your *sinful nature* which **distracts** you with desires for pleasure and comfort, to engage your hands with useless activities

The three hostile agents are paired with their three tempting techniques and each attack one of the 
three dimensions of a person. This parable is elegant and compact. It also drives home another point: time.
Planting occurs at the beginning of the growing season. Rapid growth amid rocky soil occurs through 
the rainy season (which is April to June where I live) and is not interrupted until the midsummer 
heat beats down. Lastly, the problems with thorns do not become apparent until later in the season, 
as the harvest draws near. These three temptations do not describe static events. Instead
of thinking of the three soils as three types of people, as I was taught, it looks like they are 
three distinct failure modes in a single harvest process.

After the parable tells us about three failures, it goes on to speak of three successes of different degree.
What it does not tell us is how to resist the things that cause failure and obtain an abundant yield.

**Three Allies for the Harvester**. That question, unasked by the disciples, was the decisive one for me.
When I went to the Lord asking how to produce a good harvest, he told me not what to do but who to call,
who to lean on for help in each phase of the harvest.

  - **Jesus** is the Word, so he is both sower and seed. He commands the intellect and spoken communication so can protect the **mind**. He can refute the lies and trickery of the devil and prevent the seed from being snatched by the bird. 
  - **The Holy Spirit** is the comforter of the sorrowful, the counselor of the lost. The Spirit soothes emotions and reorients desires. He dwells in the human **heart** and is the pure water that protects the plants from the heat of the sun.
  - **The Father** is the one who disciplines and guides our **hands**, pruning the thorny weeds from our lives, teaching us new habits of action. The Father helps us make good plans and is the master of time, the one who is and was and is to come.

I was pleased to see how the Trinity is intimately involved with the process of producing a harvest.
This deepened my understanding of the "economic Trinity", how the three equal persons serve different roles
in how they act in our world. It also shone a light on how our sanctification proceeds. First our mind must
be transformed, then our heart and its desires realigned, before finally we are able to reform our behavior.
"Just do it" just doesn't work.

This realization also made it clear that Spiritual Warfare is the impetus that drives the the whole of 
a faithful person closer to God so that they may be fruitful. When your mind is under assault, you turn to 
the Word. When your emotions are tattered of your desires frustrated, you turn to the Holy Spirit.
And when bad habits threaten to undo you, the Father is there to direct you back to the right path.

How? Each part of us has different ways to communicate with God.

<span id="4a" />

## The Spiritual Disciplines

*Spiritual Disciplines* is fancy way of saying "Ways to talk to God". Almost all of them are mentioned in Job,
as I noted in *Job Rises* and repeat in [Job and the Ways to Talk to God](./talk-to-god.html).
People have written whole books, each on a single one of those means of communication.
In regards to Spiritual Warfare, talking to God regularly is one of the best things you can
do to protect yourself and be prepared and guided in how to protect others.

The article cited above treats each means of communication separately, but they can't really be separated
any more than one God can be split in three. These means can sometimes be associated each with a different
member of the Trinity, then strung together in a chain that accomplishes a complete work. One example is
repentance.

  - Reading the Bible is associated with the Divine Word, which is Jesus. A believer who is reading the Bible often finds words that tell them they have done wrong. As Paul said, *"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."* (Galatians 3:24, KJV)
  - The Holy Spirit cuts us to the heart. With deep emotion, we regret their actions, even weep over our sin. Moved by the Spirit, we confess our sin and pray to God for forgiveness.
  - With the direction of the Word and the conviction of the Holy Spirit, we may seek a means to do penance and with our hands make some restitution for what we have done. Additionally, we may resolve to change our behavior and form new and better habits. This work of the hands satisfies the Father.

In the example above, a series of actions drawn from different spiritual disciplines connected to one another to engage all 
three members of the Trinity. However, sometimes the same type of action is expressed differently by the three dimensions
of a human, each oriented towards a different person of the Trinity. Prayer can be like that.

  - You pray to God to make a petition, [plead the promises](https://www.leaderu.com/orgs/bpf/pathways/plead.html), or ask for wisdom. You are specially guided by the Bible in how and what you pray. It is the Son whom you address and the prayer engages your **mind**.
  - Next, you pray in the Spirit. *"Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."* (Romans 8:26) Such pray occurs in **the deep places of your heart**.
  - Finally, you pray to the Father, either the exact words of the Lord's prayer or another prayer in the same spirit. Instead of seeking your will, you seek to know the Father's will. This prayer ends in the obedient actions of your **hands**.

Through prayer, your will and God's will begin to converge.

In the strategy game of Go, there is a concept called "light and heavy". If you defend a territory too heavily, your
opponent can expand fast into the territory where you have no presence. If you spread yourself too thin to capture
extra territory, your lightly defended territories will fall to your enemy's attack. It is the same way with your 
spiritual life. Is your faith unbalanced, directed more at one member of the Trinity than the others? 
This wold turn up in which categories of spiritual disciplines you favor and which you neglect.

Does this concept of having a diversified faith vis-a-vis the Trinity appear strange? A simpler way to look at is
like so:

  - Are you an intellectual Christian? Is the main focus of your faith reading the Bible, commentaries and books of philosophy, hearing sermons and talking about the ideas of the faith? If so, your faith dwells mostly in your mind, in the realm of the Son.
  - Are you an emotional Christian? Do religious passions, ecstatic experiences, and deep sympathy for others define your faith? When you read your favorite Bible stories for the hundredth time, do they still make you weep or rejoice? Are you keenly aware of your own sin, often guided by dreams and visions, or one who frequently speaks in tongues? Do you make yourself available to sit with the suffering or a distraught friend to offer emotional support? If so, your faith dwells mostly in your heart, in the realm of the Holy Spirit.
  - Are you a deliberate, active Christian, volunteering at church everywhere that you can? Do you swiftly take action to make amends when you offend? Do you frequently fast or give generously to the church or friends in need? If so, your faith dwells mostly in your hands, in the realm of the Father.

Many of the actions of our faith do not fall entirely under the purview of one member of the Trinity, but a strong enough connection may be inferred to be useful for diagnosing how balanced your is your faith. What follows is my attempt to 
make such an assignment. Feel free to disagree; the point is not to slice the godhead in pieces but to search your heart
and see if you need to make adjustments.

I know which part of my faith life is strongest: the mind. 
I read and study the Word, seek patterns in it and scour church history and works of theology for answers. 
Then I structure and write about what I found.

I know which part of my faith life is weakest: the hand. The Father is in charge of time and planning. I am terrible
at planning. He is also in charge of pruning us to help us find focus. I am unfocused in many areas of life.

So where are you strongest and weakest? Here are some Spiritual Disciplines (or subcategories of them), broken
by the member of the Trinity with the closest affinity to that means of communication. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive.

- The Mind: Jesus, God the Son
  - Prayers of the Mind:
    - Petition
    - Pleading the promises
    - Asking for Wisdom
  - Bible focused activities like:
    - Reading the Bible
    - Memorizing the Bible
    - Reading commentaries, theology books
    - Listening to sermons, attending conferences
    - Learning what God values
    - Recalling a guiding verse in time of need
  - Journaling
  - Pursuing a Godly conversation with a friend
  - Receiving a word of knowledge
  - Listening to a living prophet
  - Receiving an informational message from an angel
  - Hearing audible words from God
- The Heart: God the Holy Spirit
  - Prayers of the Heart
    - Praying in the Spirit. "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans." (Romans 8:26)
    - Supernatural burdens: When the Spirit tells you to pray for someone in deep need and you didn't even know they were in trouble. 
  - [Practicing the presence of God](https://ccel.org/ccel/lawrence/practice/practice).
  - Receiving words of counsel from the Spirit
  - Offering words of counsel to others, prayerfully
  - Receiving words of comfort and strength from an angel
  - Meditating on the Psalms
  - Singing praise to God
  - Having dreams and visions
  - Treasuring the things of God in your heart (like the Virgin Mary did in Luke 2)
  - Inexplicable and inexpressible things
- The Hand: God the Father
  - Marveling at God's works in nature 
  - Suffering in faith
    - Normal human suffering
    - Persecution for the Name 
  - Observing the Sabbath
  - Praying the Lord's Prayer
  - Fasting
  - Offering sacrifices:
    - as penance for your sin
    - as charity, for others
  - Entering full time Christian service in the role of pastor, missionary or something else
  - Receiving miracles of healing
  - Being assisted materially and physically by an angel
  - Seeing God via a Theophany
  - Casting lots (which is a weird one) 

Explaining all these associations would make this article unnecessarily long, but a few are worth noting.
The assignment of verbal, intellectual practices to the Son should make sense.
Concerning the second category of the Spirit, a Pentecostal could probably add a lot of additional interactions. 
Indeed, I have a hard time defining some of my own experiences in the Spirit. That leaves the Father, whose
domain of the hand is the realm of physical actions, plans and time management. His ways are the most mysterious.
To many new Christians, fasting makes no sense, even though it is a common practice in many religions.
By depriving the body of food, you are taking a physical action. You are saying that the sustenance you most need
is not of your body but of your spirit.

Fasting is a voluntary form of suffering. You pursue it because Jesus and others have told you that it is a 
meaningful activity that God honors. It is the involuntary suffering that torments and perplexes us. 
Yes, it is obviously related to the physical realm of body and hand, but it seems far from spiritual. 
Much suffering seems meaningless. Most of us are not equipped like Job to get to the bottom of it. 
Suffering IS a means whereby God communicates to us. That was one of the most important things that I 
learned while doing research for *Job Rises*. God has used it to speak to me many times, but sometimes 
it takes years for me to figure out what that message is. However, suffering fails in its mission if you 
lack faith. The person who suffers yet retains their faith in God receives a blessing, just as Job did. 
My experience with Janet Sullivan, as expressed in [Hannah's Song](./hannah-s-song.md), underscores this.
From Janet I learned that the benefit for suffering in faith does not always accrue to us.
The blessing is received by the people around us who are moved by our example. When I witnessed Janet's 
faith in the midst of a terminal illness, it changed me. The message carried by her suffering came from God 
through her to me (and to others who knew her). I was filled with tears of compassion and then a powerful joy 
that delivered me from a decade of depression.

This truth about suffering is of consolation only to those who love God and their neighbor in fulfillment of
the commandment. Only such a person can understand Paul's words:

#### Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
#### but in humility count others more significant 
#### than yourselves. Let each of you look not only
#### to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
###### - Philippians 2:3-4

To love others so much that you are willing to suffer for them is only possible if the Holy Spirit
dwells in your heart. Reflecting on this as well as on a significant challenge I faced early 
in my Christian life, I concluded that one of these means of communicating with God deserves special 
attention: **sacrifice**.

<span id="4b" />

## Sacrifice

When I became a Protestant, I formed an impression that sacrifice was downplayed. The Jews had an elaborate 
sacrificial system, the Catholics (whose beliefs I once held) a penitential system, but we had Jesus offering
the only sacrifice for sin that would ever be needed. This minimization of sacrifice is not based on 
Baptist dogmatics but on my gut reaction to what I was taking in at church, in small group fellowship, or in
my reading. We might talk of commitment or of perseverance, of "the sacrifice of praise" or tithing, but 
not sacrifice in a direct and vivid way.

This is not to say that all talk of sacrifice was absent. It attaches itself to many facets of my 
Baptist faith. We sacrifice our time. We forgo activities in which the world indulges. We sacrifice 
much of our freedom in search of a greater freedom. Like many, I refuse to work on the Sabbath, which
can create friction with employers. We are asked to sacrifice our pride. By professing
belief in ideas that the world rejects, this may cause us to sacrifice our reputation.

This strange ambivalence incited a conflict in me. Someone shared with me an idea that became a first step
toward harmony. They explained what Jesus meant by these words, delivered to people who complained
that Jesus consorted with tax collectors and sinners:

#### Go and learn what this means: 
##### ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ 
#### For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
###### - Matthew 9:13

As a person prone to taking things literally, this had been my core verse on the place of sacrifice
in the Protestant faith. I took it to mean that God didn't want sacrifice any more. Alas, those words 
mean the opposite! No, more than the opposite. They call us to lives of even greater sacrifice
than we could imagine. Jesus was telling us to sacrifice "sacrifice". My friends' insight into
what Jesus meant was this:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>The sacrifice-minded person looks mostly on what they are giving up.</p>
  <p>The mercy-minded person looks mostly on whom they are giving to.</p>
</div>

Jesus is telling us to love mercy, not the things we must sacrifice to show it. 
We must be happier about blessing our friend than we are mournful over what we had to give up in the process.
Otherwise, we are like the host of one of Solomon's proverbs:

#### Do not eat the food of a begrudging host,
##### do not crave his delicacies;
#### for he is the kind of person
##### who is always thinking about the cost.
#### “Eat and drink,” he says to you,
##### but his heart is not with you.
#### You will vomit up the little you have eaten
##### and will have wasted your compliments.
###### - Proverbs 23:6-8, NIV

In those days, I was reading *The Cost of Discipleship* by Dietrich Bonhoeffer. In that book
he harangued against "cheap grace". He believed that God's grace was both free and costly.
Recall the man in Jesus' parable who found the treasure in the field (in Matthew 13:44), 
then sold all he had to buy that field? That is a steep cost. I am proud to say that I recognized 
how great the cost of following Jesus was. I accepted Bonhoeffer's words, attempted to put them into practice 
**and failed**. The sacrifices he said that Jesus called upon us to offer were more than I could bear.

I no longer feel that way. My change in perspective required decades of struggle and 
the learning of more than one lesson. Before I share a few of the stories of experiences that changed me, 
it is important to clear up what sacrifice is. 

### Definition and Process

Sacrifice is a way to say to God or your neighbor, "I love you. You matter to me. 
You are more important to me than the things I am giving up." That may seem obvious to you, 
but it wasn't to me. Sacrifice is a form of communication. The old proverb that comes to mind is 
"Actions speak louder than words."

Life and the Holy Spirit's whispering periodically set before you an opportunity to offer a sacrifice 
or not. What makes "the cost" that Bonhoeffer wrote about high or low? What motivates a person 
to pay that cost? My failures sprang from placing too great a focus on one side of the equation.
Sheer will mixed with gratitude for Christ's sacrifice on the cross could only carry me so far.
One by one, I identified a series of truths that liberated me from this situation of despair and failure in
following Christ. Once you understand and accept these truths, a marvelous change will come over you.
It begins with the Golden Rule, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

  1. The starting points are the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) and the Greatest Commandment (Matthew 22:36-40).
  2. Like the lyrics from a Foreigner song, "I want to know what love is." I needed someone to show me. (John 13:34-35)
  3. By seeing the Church model love and reading how Paul defines it (1 Corinthians 13), I learned what love is.
  4. By trying and failing, I discovered that the Cost to love my neighbor and my God and so fulfill the Golden Rule is high. (Matthew 10:39, 16:25)
  5. At the same time, I lamented that I am materially, emotionally and spiritually poor; I do not have the resources to meet my neighbor's needs. (Revelation 3:17-18)
  6. I learned that by faith, if I ask, seek, and knock, God will supply me with the resources I need. (Matthew 7:7-10)
  7. Jesus tells us to pursue heavenly treasures... (Matthew 6:19-21)
  8. ... but I did not know what those treasures are; they are hidden. (Job 28, Proverbs 25:2, Colossians 2:3)
  9. By searching for wisdom as instructed by Proverbs, I discovered what those true treasures are. (Proverbs 2)
  10. By offering sacrifices, I replaced my old, materialistic values with a desire for heavenly treasures. (Romans 12:2)
  11. With a new heart that values what God values, the sacrificial cost of loving God and neighbor did not seem so high. (Hebrews 12:1-4)
  12. With this altered emotional appraisal of the cost, the difficulty of serving God and neighbor was diminished and I made progress toward spiritual maturity. (James 1:2-5)

The critical discovery was that when your value system changes, so does the cost of discipleship.
When you realize that the things you once treasured and which were hard to give up have little value,
then the sacrifice of valuables metamorphoses into a trade of trash for treasure. The journey to get to that point,
however, is paved with sacrifices made before that transformation is complete. While you are making the early
ones, they are painful. Here is a sampling from my life. Lest I sound like I am bragging, I know people who 
have sacrificed far more than I in order to follow the Lord. What I sacrificed is not remarkable; what
the Lord did for me is. The blessings we receive in response far exceed what we offer. God is gracious.
The list I give is to meant to show that to transform a whole life, you need a burnt offering. 
In the ancient Jewish sacrificial system, the burnt offering consumes everything, unlike some of the
offerings which left part of the food to be shared with priest or family. That means that sacrifices 
must be made in every area of your life, otherwise that part of you will remain unchanged. 
I do not know if I have yet made sacrifices in every area of my life, but I am getting there.

### Love

Love touches everything. No progress in the Christian faith is possible without some knowledge of love
and commitment to act in love. In the Spring of 1985, I learned three lessons about love. First,
a woman named Jenifer witnessed to me about the love of Jesus gave me an illuminated poster that she had drawn.
The words on the poster were taken from 1 Corinthians 13, Paul's chapter on love. This taught my
mind God's definition of love. Second, the woman's church demonstrated Christian love by how they
treated each other. A popular hymn from that era said, "They will know we are Christians by our love."
I could not put my finger on it but the kindness and consideration they showed each other made an impact
on my heart. With mind and heart enlightened about love, one thing remained: my hands. One of the ways that
the hands put into practice the truths of God is though sacrifice.
