title: Spiritual Warfare
quote: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, <br/> but against... the spiritual forces of evil <br/> in the heavenly realms. <br/> - Ephesians 6:12ac

The problem with the topic of spiritual warfare is not that it is difficult to find useful, understandable 
guidance on the subject in the Bible. The problem is that there is so much! That is not the only problem.
When you are under siege, logic and proportion vanish. Crises bring pain, impatience, shortcuts, and despair.
They drain you of energy and wreck your plans. Paranoia or shame separate you from the friends you need to
help you get through. Hearing an argument put forth and defended point by point will not do.
Even if you agreed that the ideas are sound, the ability to put them into practice is not there.

Where does that leave Biblical principles? Are they robbed of their power? No! We must take our cue from Solomon.
It is a matter of the right time.

  - The right time to learn Biblical principles on how to prevail in a spiritual battle is before the crisis begins.
  - The right person to apply the principles is often not you the sufferer but a fellow Christian walking on stable ground who comes up alongside you.
  - The right words from the Bible for the moment may come to you mysteriously and they may not even make sense, but they don't have to make sense for them to begin the healing process. They just have to make sense to the Holy Spirit who is administering them.
  - When the first three are not an option, faith in the love of the invisible God can sustain us when we have no support.

It is possible to learn new truths and put them into practice even while under fire. In [Dreams](./dreams.html) I share how I was delivered from
persistent nightmares through prayer and meditation on the Psalms and Isaiah, guided to the verses I needed by God's grace.
Be grateful when such things happen to you. In my experience, such victories are rare. Take your swimming lessons before you board leaky boats.

## Get to Know Your Ally First

Dangerous ideas have long circulated that distract from assembling the best spiritual defense. I do not know if they are entirely wrong,
but they put the focus in the wrong place. Before putting forth some good ideas about how to defend yourself against the enemy,
let us push aside some bad ones. Paul said that knowledge puffs up. There is a sort of knowledge that seems indispensable when it comes
to battling demons. It is not.

If you suspect that a friend or acquaintance is possessed by a demon or that they or you are oppressed by one, what do you need to know?
Some people teach that you need to learn the demon's name in order to cast it out. To get it, you pray over the afflicted person
charging the demon in Christ's name to speak and reveal its identity. Then with that knowledge, you can effectively pray for it to be cast out.
When I was a new Christian, this idea seemed sensible. I was not yet well acquainted with the story of Job. The way that the
story is framed, there is no evidence that during his trials Job knew of the existence of Satan. He certainly had no clue that it was 
Satan who was afflicting him. His sole focus was on God. That faith sustained him and enabled him to prevail. In like fashion,
we do not need to know who or what is afflicting us. Is it a demon? A jealous colleague? A criminal living down the street?
A communicable disease? Your own sin? God is stronger than all of them and I see nowhere in Scripture that a person is faulted 
for being ignorant about the nature of a demon. Yes, Jesus does ask one demon-possessed man, "What is your name?" (Luke 8:30)
The answer to that question had meaning to Jesus, who as the Son of God knows all things and therefore the identities of all demons.
If we ask such a question and are answered, of what use is it to us? We do not know where to send it, or what is its assigned place or 
assigned time for judgment. Jesus' normal practice was to not listen to the demons at all, but to shut them up! (Luke 4:33-37)

Spend your time getting to know Jesus by meditating on his Word. Abide in the Spirit. Pray to the Father. God has all the knowledge
He needs to deal with your problem. The only deviation from this is when Jesus told his disciples that to cast out a certain demon,
in addition to praying they needed also to fast. Is fasting a means of communicating with Satan? No! It is one of the means we are
taught to communicate with God. So whatever the problem is, the answer is to spend more and deeper time in prayer, praise and worship of God.

Another idea is that there are territorial spirits. We must identify them and pray against them that the territory, 
whether a city, region, nation or empire, be freed from their grip and the Holy Spirit take charge. 
The Book of Daniel is cited for this. Daniel prayed and fasted for weeks before he received an answer to his petition. 
(Daniel 10:12-13) The angel told him that he was resisted by the "prince of the Persian kingdom", causing the delay. 
Many think that this prince was a fallen angel. It seems probable that every nation or at least great earthly empire 
has standing behind it such an angel, whether good or evil. While Paul in Ephesians tells us that we are battling 
against principalities in the heavenly realms, how does he advise us? We are to pray for kings and 
all who rule over us. Them we can see. Them we can pray for. Them we can resist if they command evil. 
As we move in faith in this world, our actions have an impact in the other world but we are not to become preoccupied with that.

Lest someone accuse me of dismissing an important idea in ignorance, I will say this. When I went to Romania in Summer 1991
on a short term mission trip, as soon as I crossed the border I felt something. The nation "felt" different from any place
I had ever been. After leaving Hungary, I felt like the spiritual atmosphere over Romania was purer. I knew God was up to 
something in that place. Two years earlier, I had felt an urgent pull, drawing me irresistibly to study Eastern Europe. 
In my spirit I felt that something huge was happening in the world, but I didn't know what. It was Summer 1989. I attended a 
missions conference in July 1989 and heard a Romanian exile named Joseph Tson speak. He prophesied that Communism was 
about to fall. I was electrified. That Fall it happened exactly as he said. For months I had felt God applying 
massive spiritual force to the world. He was preparing to topple many nations, but I knew it not. I bet each nation had its own 
angel in charge. It didn't matter. They all lost their foothold, but not because church people learned a bunch of 
demon's names and said special prayers. No, Christians had been crying out to God for relief for decades and he answered. 
That is where you look, at the Father, not at the enemy. Despite the powerful feelings I had during those years and how 
well they lined up with the idea of territorial spirits, I have never found any use for that knowledge that could improve 
how I pray or act.

What use was it then? The visceral sense of such things caused me to marvel at God for showing me a glimpse of the 
great things He was doing. It gave me the insight to understand that God does judge nations and topple empires, just like
he promised. It helped me trust ancient prophecies about God's plans. That certainty helped me persevere through years 
of Bible study and writing when so much didn't make sense. If the Lord can overthrow a beastly empire like Communist Russia 
in a season, is there anything He cannot do?

## Dimensions to Spiritual Warfare

The starting point for victory in spiritual warfare is not knowledge, it is the humble admission of ignorance, emptiness, 
and powerlessness. The person who admits their need and turns to God for help has taken the first step in
acquiring an educated mind, a stout heart and arms strong for the the task of opposing evil and building what is good.
In the Spring of 1985, I was conversing with a believer about the Bible. He told me that he was impressed by my 
Bible knowledge. I said to him, "Yes, I have read the Bible, but I don't understand it." Weeks later I became a Christian.
My admission of ignorance was one of the factors that enabled me to be saved.

Later that year, filled with anxiety about my studies, fear about my future and in a general state of depression, 
I cried out to God, "Jesus, I still don't know if you exist, but if you don't there is no hope for my life." 
I resolved to place all my hope in Jesus because I knew of no other place to turn. In response, God began to heal 
and strengthen my emotional core.

As for strength and direction in life, hours after my desperate prayer, the Lord gave me an idea for my bachelors thesis,
then the perseverance to spend the next twenty months completing it. That thesis led directly to my first job out of college,
which proved to be an excellent start for my career as a software engineer.

A sure **mind**, a steady **heart** and a guided and disciplined **hand**. Those are the three broad areas of life that God assisted me 
with during my first year as a Christian. I can understand those categories now and see how they surface all over the Bible
and all over my life, but at the beginning I knew nothing of such things. The rest of this article will not tell you how to
fight the battle. It will tell you how to see it.

Lots of wise Christians have put forth useful ideas about spiritual growth. They shape what they have learned into logical forms.
Some of those forms are of their own invention and some are taken straight from the Bible. My preference is to propose
categories and processes defined in the Bible. That helps me guard against adding something beyond what God has said 
or leaving out something vital. I trust the Bible to cover topics as completely as God intended; I do not trust myself to do the same. 

What are these categories, these lists of love that the Lord has lavished upon us? Here are the ones that I have discovered.
Many are not original with me - which is a good thing!

  - The three parts of a person: Mind, Heart and Hand
  - The three spheres of hostility: the Devil, the World and the Flesh
  - The three forces of temptation: Fraud, Fear and Focus
  - The three allies of faith: Jesus, the Holy Spirit and the Father
  - The three levels of growth: Material Growth, Individual Spiritual Growth, Collective Church Growth
  - The three kinds of Heavenly Treasures: for Establishing, Nourishing, and Flourishing
  - [The Spiritual Disciplines](./talk-to-god.html)
  - [The Five Voices to ignore](./proverbs-20-to-29.html) : the fools, the sluggards, the quarrelsome, the malicious, the flatterers
  - [The Five Battlefields](./riddles-of-war.html): the individual, the workplace, the family, the church, the state
  - [The Sevenfold Path to a Spiritual Harvest](./harvest-pattern.html): Preparation, Plowing, Planting, Pouring, Plucking, Producing, Peace
  - [The Seven Phases of Spiritual Growth](./growth-pattern.html): Security, Ability, Stability, Amity, Opportunity, Community, Loyalty
  - [The Seven Spirits of God](./seven-spirits.html): Lordship, Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Might, Knowledge, Fear of the Lord
  - [The Seven Pillars of Wisdom](./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html)
  - [The Law of Christ](./law-pattern.html)
  - The Whole Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-20)

Each of these ways of slicing the spiritual world gives you insight into another facet of the problem.
Some are diagnostic of your current state while others plot out a course for you to follow to progress towards maturity and peace.
This article will introduce them, some in groups and some alone. Many are explored in detail in other articles on this website.
If the complexity appears daunting, reflect on Jesus' words:

#### And he said,
##### “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed
##### on the ground. He sleeps and rises night and day,
##### and the seed sprouts and grows; **he knows not how**. 
##### The earth produces by itself, first the blade, 
##### then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. 
##### But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle,
##### because the harvest has come.”
###### - Mark 4:26-29

The Word of God is infinitely complex, designed by the Creator of the Universe, yet we do not need to understand
all that complexity for it to sprout within us and produce a harvest. It is like your doctor prescribing a pill.
Do you know its chemical formula? How it was manufactured? How it interacts with the different systems of your body?
How it targets your ailment? How your body eliminates it when it is no longer needed? No, you just need to trust
your doctor, your pharmacist and the factory that made the pill. You need to trust them, pour a glass of water,
and swallow. Yet if you work for the pharmaceutical company designing an improvement to the drug, you need to know these things.
If you are the doctor, you need to know the side effects and the characteristics that indicate whether that drug
or another will be better for a given patient. And if you are a mature Christian, you need to learn these things if
you are to mentor younger people.

When we are infants in the faith, the Lord cares for us like babes. We are short on knowledge and lean on our faith
and the assistance of others. Months after I became a Christian, another believer pointed me to a sound Bible study; 
her advice spared me from joining a pseudo-Christian cult. Then when my new Bible study leader visited churches, 
I tagged along and ended up at a good one. As we grow older, the Lord steps back. We are expected to grow in maturity 
and proactively pursue knowledge, just like parents step back when their children become adults.
In the sections that follow, I show a few of the things that I have learned related to spiritual warfare.
The most important is that this warfare is permitted by God to help us grow. The crises in my life taught
me how to distinguish between the voice of God and the voice of the enemy. Without "a time for war", you will never be prepared
to enter into the "time for peace".
