title: The Golden Rule
quote: Do unto others <br/> as you would have them <br/> do unto you. </br> - Jesus Christ

I believe that the Golden Rule deserves its appellation.
I did not always think that way. This article shares a little of my journey
toward understanding how profound are the words of Jesus found in Matthew 7.

The Golden Rule makes perfect sense until you realize that it is sandwiched in between
other sayings that deepen its meaning:

#### <sup>7</sup> “**Ask**, and it will be given to you; 
##### **seek**, and you will find; 
###### **knock**, and it will be opened to you. 
#### <sup>8</sup> For everyone who asks receives, 
##### and the one who seeks finds, 
###### and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 
#### <sup>9</sup> Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, 
##### will give him a stone? 
#### <sup>10</sup> Or if he asks for a fish, 
##### will give him a serpent?
#### <sup>11</sup> If you then, who are evil,
##### know how to give good gifts to your children,
#### how much more will your Father who is in heaven 
##### give good things to those who ask him!
#### <sup>12</sup> **“So whatever you wish that others would do to you,** 
#### **do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.**
#### <sup>13</sup> “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide 
#### and the way is easy that leads to destruction, 
#### and those who enter by it are many. 
#### <sup>14</sup> For the gate is narrow and the way is hard 
#### that leads to life, and those who find it are few."
###### - Matthew 7:7-14

I slowly worked my way outward from the core in verse 12 to get to the understanding I have today.
Each step toward clarity required me to overcome an obstacle. Some of those obstacles were:

  - Laziness
  - Pride
  - Depression
  - Feelings of inadequacy
  - Lack of faith
  - Insecurity and shame
  - Wrong values
  - A fuzzy picture of God 

These spiritual deficits made it hard for me to believe and live according to this rule and
believe that it means exactly what Jesus said it means. To make the significance crystal clear,
I begin with this conundrum. After I made major progress in understanding the Golden Rule in the 
early 1990's, I was convinced that I had just made a breakthrough and now understood one of the most
important truths in Christianity. I was certain that - knowing this - there was nothing I couldn't
do. I had no more questions for God and was content that I had mastered a truth so profound that
I could move forward in victory and confidence the rest of my life.

Shortly after that, I was plunged into crisis after crisis, faced the magnitude of my ignorance,
and set on a road of constantly seeking God for more questions, more answers and an ever deeper 
understanding of who He is and how to love Him and my neighbor better. Over thirty years later,
I retain my appraisal that the Golden Rule is profound and a useful guide to life. 
I have learned so much more in the intervening years. It is not a beverage that you drink from
once and are forever satisfied. It is a spring you return to often to be refreshed and gain
new insight. Now here is my golden rule journey.



In progress...
