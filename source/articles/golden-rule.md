title: The Golden Rule

We strive to grow spiritually so that we may reach full maturity in the faith
and be a source of light and love in this world. Jesus told us not to hide
our light under a bushel (Matthew 5:15-16). If you take the basket off your head, 
is there any light there to shine? There is a simple test of whether you are a 
spiritually mature Christian. Do your thoughts, words and deeds follow the 
Golden Rule of Jesus Christ?

#### <sup>7</sup> “**Ask**, and it will be given to you; 
##### **seek**, and you will find; 
###### **knock**, and it will be opened to you. 
#### <sup>8</sup> For everyone who asks receives, 
##### and the one who seeks finds, 
###### and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 
#### <sup>9</sup> Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, 
##### will give him a stone? 
#### <sup>10</sup> Or if he asks for a fish, 
##### will give him a serpent?
#### <sup>11</sup> If you then, who are evil,
##### know how to give good gifts to your children,
#### how much more will your Father who is in heaven 
##### give good things to those who ask him!
#### <sup>12</sup> **“So whatever you wish that others would do to you,** 
#### **do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.**
#### <sup>13</sup> “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide 
#### and the way is easy that leads to destruction, 
#### and those who enter by it are many. 
#### <sup>14</sup> For the gate is narrow and the way is hard 
#### that leads to life, and those who find it are few."
###### - Matthew 7:7-14

I believe that the Golden Rule deserves its appellation. It is golden. 
When it shines out from us it lights a path to guide the lost to safety.
I did not always think that way. This article shares a little of my journey
toward understanding how profound are the words of Jesus found in Matthew 7.
After being steeped in the negative philosophy of Job, Ecclesiastes and Proverbs,
my approach is simple. I will catalog a few of my failures to understand and apply this
glorious teaching and how those failures guided me to the truth. 

This is the engineer in me speaking. Each time a machine or a system fails, we learn 
something useful about it. We learn the limits of its operating range. We learn how to improve it.
So it is with the Golden Rule. It is not easy to follow. Each unsuccessful attempt to follow
it teaches us what needs to change inside us so that we may do better the next time.
Those changes must be made to:

  - **our mind**, because we do not understand the details of how to apply the rule in a new situation
  - **our heart**, because our values and priorities are not aligned with God's and we despair of ever measuring up
  - **our hands**, because there is a lot for them to do and we must practice to use them skillfully

The Golden Rule makes perfect sense until you realize that it is sandwiched in between
other sayings that deepen its meaning, from the "ask-seek-knock" part to the narrowness of the gate.
We are told straight away that it will not be easy. Some of the obstacles I run up against are:

  - Laziness
  - Pride
  - Depression
  - Feelings of inadequacy
  - Lack of faith
  - Insecurity and shame
  - Wrong values
  - A fuzzy picture of God 

These spiritual deficits made it hard for me to believe and live according to this rule and
believe that it means exactly what Jesus said it means. To make the significance crystal clear,
I begin with this conundrum. After I made major progress in understanding the Golden Rule in the 
early 1990's, I was convinced that I had just made a breakthrough and now understood one of the most
important truths in Christianity. I was certain that - knowing this - there was nothing I couldn't
do. I had no more questions for God and was content that I had mastered a truth so profound that
I could move forward in victory and confidence the rest of my life.

Shortly after that, I was plunged into crisis after crisis, faced the magnitude of my ignorance,
and set on a road of constantly seeking God for more questions, more answers and an ever deeper 
understanding of who He is and how to love Him and my neighbor better. Over thirty years later,
I retain my appraisal that the Golden Rule is profound and a useful guide to life. 
I have learned so much more in the intervening years. It is not a beverage that you drink from
once and are forever satisfied. It is a spring you return to often to be refreshed and gain
new insight. Now here is my golden rule journey.



In progress...
