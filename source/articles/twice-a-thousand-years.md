title: Twice a Thousand Years
quote: Even though he should live <br/> a thousand years twice over... <br/> - Proverbs 6:6a

#### Up from Earth's Centre through the seventh Gate
##### I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,
#### And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road;
##### But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate.
###### - The Rubaiyat of Omar Kayyam

Ecclesiastes is a book of riddles. Unlike the poem by Omar Khayyam, if you unravel all its riddles, 
you will have unraveled that master-knot. You will learn deep things about human fate.

Over a decade ago ago, I tried to solve those riddles. I failed. In my failure, I had three insights into the problem which I wasn't sure were correct,
but they were. My insights were that these three things were important:

  - To decipher the poem of the times in chapter 3 and its relation to the whole
  - To deduce the purpose of the repetition of "under the sun" throughout
  - To understand the conclusion, how to "fear God and Keep His commandments" followed from the rest, and how it is an attractive purpose for life

My investigation into those mysteries fills the pages of *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. I summarized some of my findings in the chapter 
"Ecclesiastes 3: Knowing the Acceptable Time" in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. This article repeats part of that chapter.
It addresses the first two insights, but five riddles:

  - What is the outline of Ecclesiastes?
  - Why are the twenty-eight times times ordered as they are?
  - What do the times tell us about how to plan our lives?
  - Are the times prophetic?
  - If so, when does the period of time spoken of in the prophecy begin and end?

The last riddle is the cleverest riddle I have ever solved. It is marvelous, not just for what it reveals,
but also because it opens the door to solving riddles all over the Bible. This one discovery set me on the path 
to discovering scores of prophetic clocks, identifying the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the structure of Paul's letters, and so much more.
Because of this riddle, I believe that Ecclesiastes is the mainspring of God's prophetic clock.

Behold the Master-Knot...
