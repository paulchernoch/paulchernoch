title: Blueprint for Lady Wisdom's House
---
## Abstract

In Proverbs, the wisdom of God is likened to a house. This is not for merely pedagogical reasons. 
Not only the whole but the parts in their relationship to one another resemble a house.
Foundation, pillars, roof, and lighting all map to aspects of the Bible. Those structural 
elements are nailed together using semantic patterns that are analogous to fastener hardware.
This article is an expansion of the chapter "Architecture of Lady Wisdom's House" from
the book *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*.

Solomon sets forth the path to maturity in Ecclesiastes. What does he have the man do who has
attained this rank in life? In Ecclesiastes 10, he has him build a house. That chapter is an extended metaphor
on how to build a life, a family and a legacy. For such an undertaking, it is wise to hire the
best architect available. Proverbs introduces the craftsman with the best reputation and skill, 
but it isn't a man. If you want a basement that won't flood and a roof that doesn't leak, 
you need Lady Wisdom. 

## Architecture of Lady Wisdom’s House

In the preamble to the Ten Commandments, the Lord said that he led the people out of
the land of slavery. Many translations use a different phrase: the house of slavery. If they
were leaving one house, it must mean that they were being carried to another house. So
they were. Their new house was the House of Wisdom, called in Proverbs Lady Wisdom’s
house.

We do not have complete blueprints for Lady Wisdom’s house. This is what I have
figured out so far. The clues are Bible passages and structural patterns that show how the
wisdom of the Bible is interconnected, sequenced and quantified. The closest thing we
have to a CAD/CAM drawing is found in Proverbs:

#### Wisdom has built her house;
##### she has hewn her seven pillars.
#### She has slaughtered her beasts;
##### she has mixed her wine;
###### she has also set her table. 
###### - Proverbs 9:1-2, ESV

## Foundation

The Bible is Lady Wisdom’s house (or if you will, it’s blueprint). Its foundation is the
Law, the five Books of Moses. Jewish tradition suggests that the original Ten
Commandments were carved upon tablets of lapis lazuli. That imagery is also associated
with the base of God’s heavenly throne:

#### I looked, and I saw the likeness of a throne 
#### of lapis lazuli above the vault that was over 
#### the heads of the cherubim. 
###### - Ezekiel 10:1, NIV

Lapis lazuli is foundational to a promise:

#### “Afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted,
#### I will rebuild you with stones of turquoise,
#### your **foundations** with lapis lazuli. 
###### - Isaiah 54:11, NIV

Job includes lapis lazuli in his inventory of treasures in Job 28. The law of God is our
greatest treasure, as David argued in Psalm 119. The remaining parts of God’s house are
connected to this precious foundation by structure and imagery. The chapter “Matthew
and the Law of Christ” shall develop the Law Pattern and rigorously show how the Law
connects to the Harvest and Growth Patterns, hence the pillars.

## Pillars

The seven pillars are seven Bible books, arranged in this order: 

  - Psalms
  - Job
  - Proverbs
  - Song of Songs
  - Ecclesiastes
  - Matthew
  - Revelation

Three of Solomon’s books form its core; Solomon also penned at least one Psalm. 
What unifies them are a Growth Pattern of twenty-eight times defined in
Ecclesiastes 3 and a sevenfold Harvest Pattern defined in Matthew. (The Growth Pattern
is described in [The Growth Pattern of Solomon](./growth-pattern.html). 
The Harvest Pattern is describes in [The Harvest Pattern of Jesus](./harvest-pattern.html). ) 
All seven books contain both patterns. These patterns dominate the material of six of the pillar books. 
The exception is Psalms, whose complete structure eludes me. (I devote many chapters in both
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* to describing the patterns that 
I could identify in Psalms. There are a lot of Psalms!)
Even so, the Growth and Harvest Patterns are displayed in about half the Psalms.

Jesus said something that is more than a comparison. It is a riddle:

#### The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with
#### this generation and condemn it; for she came from
#### the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, 
#### and now **something greater than Solomon is here**.
###### - Matthew 12:42, NIV

Each chapter of the Gospel of Matthew contains elements that match the corresponding
time of Solomon’s list. However, Matthew also includes at least seventeen instances of
the Harvest Pattern. Furthermore, the seven pillars of wisdom are arranged in the order
I listed them for a reason. That order follows the sevenfold Harvest Pattern. So internally,
Solomon’s pattern dominates most pillars. But externally, the seven are governed by Jesus’
pattern. His is the greater pattern, illustrating that his wisdom is greater than Solomon’s.

Why should we order the seven pillars like that? The Harvest Pattern is Preparation,
Plowing, Planting, Pouring, Plucking, Producing and Peace. Preparation is accepting the
Lordship of Jesus Christ. The Psalms speak of the Lord more than any other book in the
Bible. Plowing is about suffering, and Job is focused on enduring and learning from our
suffering. Proverbs plants seeds of wisdom in the mind. Song of Songs waters a thirsty
heart and addresses our emotions and desires. Ecclesiastes is all about purpose, priorities,
and time management, hence plucking out all the weeds of what is not important.
Matthew is all about producing a harvest. Jesus is there called the Lord of the Harvest and
harvest imagery is found throughout. Finally, Revelation is about the peace that will follow
the final war, the final harvest of souls.

The nature of the books is not the only clue to their ordering. Hannah’s prayer of
thanksgiving in 1 Samuel 2 is also a prophecy about the seven pillars of wisdom. As a
woman who had been barren, her key praise is **“The barren has borne seven.”** 
Her prayer alternates between opposites like killing and giving life, but there is 
an interlude without opposites that stands out: 

#### “For the **pillars of the earth** are the Lord's, 
##### and on them he has set the world.” 

Each pair of opposites in Hannah's prayer matches a pillar book, a phase of the Growth Pattern, 
and a period in history. 

(See [Hannah's Song](./hannah-s-song.html) for an extended analysis of her prayer.
It shows that the ten verses her prayer are also intentionally structured according to the Ten Commandments.
This is another fastener connecting the parts of the house together.)

## Footings

A most amazing discovery is that the pillars fit snugly into the foundation of the law.
The Ten Commandments may be expressed as fourteen imperative statements. For example,
the Sabbath commandment has three parts: keep the sabbath holy, work six days, and 
don't work on the seventh day. When divided this way, the first seven imperative statements are
about loving God. The second set of seven are statements about loving your neighbor. 
God is eternal, so our love for God must be eternal. People live in time, so our love for 
our neighbors is temporal.

The Growth Pattern of Solomon is temporal; it is derived from the poem of the twenty-eight times
in Ecclesiastes 3. Thus the seven phases of the Growth Pattern match the eighth through the 
fourteenth imperatives.

The Harvest Pattern of Jesus is about the pursuit of heavenly treasures. Those first
seven imperatives in the Law therefore match the seven phases of the Harvest Pattern.

Together, the match between the two patterns and the Decalogue shows that the Law is not
a set of static rules. The Law is dynamic and points the way to a harvest of peace.

For an extended discussion of how the Law is so structured, see these articles:

  - [Matthew and the Law of Christ](./matthew-and-the-law-of-christ.html)

## Roof

This feature of Wisdom’s house was the last to occur to me. Both the Harvest Pattern
and the Growth Pattern end the same: with peace. If those patterns define the seven pillars,
then the tops of the pillars are capped by an overarching roof of peace. The Apostle Paul
employed the word “peace” more than any other Bible writer. Paul said of himself, 
*“Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.”* (1 Corinthians 15:8) 
The pillars are about time and eternity. Paul comes last, to speak of the peace 
at the end of time that flows into the eternal peace of Heaven.

The elements of a house must fit together. In Ecclesiastes 10, Solomon warns against
poor design leading to sagging rafters and a roof that leaks. Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:10
calls himself a wise builder. In that instance, Paul speaks of his ministry as laying a
foundation, not building a roof. 1 & 2 Timothy and others of his letters comment
extensively on law and grace, which is foundation work. ("Appendix I: A Clock for Timothy"
in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* shows how the ten chapters of the two letters are 
structured according to the Ten Commandments, with 1 Timothy 1:8-11 giving examples of breaking 
all of them.) Romans and Ephesians include Paul’s most powerful words about peace, 
so they are part of the roof. Romans connects law and grace to peace, combining them.

Many people argue about what to make of the perceived differences between the
doctrines of Jesus found in the Gospels and the doctrines of Paul. Paul was building the
roof. He had a different job to do. Part of that job was to train up mature individuals and 
churches.

Did you ever wonder why Paul's letters to the churches are ordered as they are? 
It is not random and it is only coincidentally by descending length. His first seven 
letters fit snugly into the Growth Pattern. Each letter matches one of the phases of Solomon's Pattern:

  - Security: **Romans** teaches us Eternal Security
  - Ability: **1 Corinthians** trains us in the spiritual gifts, our charismatic abilities
  - Stability: **2 Corinthians** steadies us with comfort from the God of all comfort
  - Amity: **Galatians** warns us not to embrace a different gospel
  - Opportunity: **Ephesians** pours out "every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places"
  - Community: **Philippians** teaches us how to "\[be\] in full accord and of one mind"
  - Loyalty: **Colossians** brings us to full maturity in Christ, "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"

If you follow the progression through these seven letters, you will reach full maturity and acquire
"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge". Thus the letters are arranged as a comprehensive discipleship
training course. For a detailed analysis and defense of this idea, see the article 
[The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program](./pauls-discipleship-program.html). It is an idea
original to this website and not found in any of my books (yet).

## Lighting (Spirits)

It is easy to imagine a torch mounted on each pillar, to light the house. Revelation 1:20
speaks of churches as lampstands and starry flames as the angels of the churches. Some
people believe the seven pillars are the seven spirits of God. Those spirits are numbered in
Revelation 1:4, 3:1, 4:5, and 5:6 and named in Isaiah. I do not believe that these spirits are
the pillars but instead each are matched with a pillar to illuminate its themes.

The seven spirits are (with numbers added by me):

#### And the (1) **Spirit of the Lord** shall rest upon him,
#### the Spirit of (2) **wisdom** and (3) **understanding**,
#### the Spirit of (4) **counsel** and (5) **might**,
#### the Spirit of (6) **knowledge** and (7) **the fear of the Lord**.
###### - Isaiah 11:2, ESV

**First**, from these we know that Psalms extol Lordship. Indeed, no other Bible book holds
more verses that cite the word Lord (717 verses) than the Psalms.

**Second**, we find that Job shines light upon wisdom. Why wisdom? Solomon said, 
*“The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.”*
(Ecclesiastes 7:4, ESV) Wisdom is first born from suffering, though its full flowering
comes later.

**Third**, Proverbs is aligned with the spirit of understanding. Understanding is bound up
with worship, and Proverbs is devoted to teaching us what is worthy of our worship and
pursuit and what is not.

**Fourth** brings the less obvious connection between Song of Songs and the spirit of
counsel. The woman in love counsels her friends about being careful not to arouse or
awaken love until it is time. If you compare the poem of the times in Ecclesiastes 3 to the
twenty-eight speaking parts in the song, you will find that fifteen times the speaker says or
does something consistent with the opposite time, the exactly wrong time. We really need
that spirit of counsel.

The **fifth** spirit, of might, matches Ecclesiastes. That book is tied up with time
management and focusing on priorities. Solomon speaks extensively of work: of planting
vineyards, building houses, and trading goods with foreign lands. Among his most
pointed messages is this:

#### Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might,
#### for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom 
#### in Sheol, to which you are going. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 9:10, ESV

The **sixth** spirit, of knowledge, illuminates the Gospel of Matthew. If the suffering of Job
brought forth the first fruits of wisdom, Jesus is Lord of the Harvest (Matthew 9:38). The
full flowering of the detailed knowledge of all things is found in Christ.

The **seventh** is the spirit of the fear of the Lord. Unquestionably, Revelation, chronicle of
the final bowls of the final plagues, is the book for the last spirit.
God sent these seven spirits, collectively the ministry of the Holy Spirit, into the whole
earth to illuminate these seven pillars. What can a believer so illuminated learn?

## Provisions (Beasts)

Lady Wisdom is hosting a dinner party. The verses previously quoted from Proverbs 9
describe more than her house. There is food, drink and an elegantly set table. For food,
she has slaughtered her beasts. According to the prophets, beasts are empires. They pop up
in Job, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and elsewhere. Their last appearance is in Revelation.
Theologians have identified many of the beasts, like Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and
Rome. The rise and fall of these empires is an important aspect of God’s plan for history.
Like calves, God fattens them by feeding them the world, then slaughters them for his
feast. All the wealth they have stolen is then inherited by the faithful.

Many of the pillars make reference to these beasts, tying their themes and structures
together. The associations are sometimes difficult, as multiple analogies are used. Thus
Rome is sometimes wolves, or iron, or a terrible beast. We shall delve into what Job says
about the many beasts later.

## Wine

Revelation is clear about the wine. The sour wine is what issues from God’s judgment
against false religion.

#### For all nations have drunk
##### the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,
#### and the kings of the earth
##### have committed immorality with her,
#### and the merchants of the earth have grown rich
##### from the power of her luxurious living.”
###### - Revelation 18:3, ESV

#### From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which 
#### to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a
#### rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury 
#### of the wrath of God the Almighty.
###### - Revelation 19:15

The sweet wine is pure religion. Remember the wedding at Cana? Jesus is
saving the best wine for last. Until then, we drink wine at communion and
remember the precious promises.

## Table

The table that Lady Wisdom has set could be simple, like the good shepherd’s:

#### You prepare a table before me
##### in the presence of my enemies;
#### you anoint my head with oil;
##### my cup overflows.
###### - Psalm 23:5, ESV

Given the context, it must be as grand as the wedding supper of the Lamb in Revelation.
House, pillar, beast and feast. This proverb of Lady Wisdom’s house ties together many
threads of prophecy. That is the matrix in which the Ten Commandments fit. To
understand those commandments and the corresponding ten plagues, we must first speak
of Solomon’s Growth Pattern. The reason is that most of the Bible’s prophetic clocks do
not satisfy all thirteen of the expectations laid out earlier. They satisfy some requirements
and then point to a related clock to provide the rest. Often, that clock is Solomon’s.
