This article is based on ideas from the chapter "Revelation 16: Judging the World" of the book *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. 
It divides the judgments found in Revelation into seven parts and shows how each is instigated
by a different one of the Seven Spirits of God listed in Isaiah 11:2. Revelation 5:6 tells us that God sent the
Seven Spirits of God out into the earth. Read ahead and find out what each of them will be up to.
