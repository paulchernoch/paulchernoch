## Abstract

The Seven Spirits of God spoken of by John in Revelation are enigmatic. 
They factor into so many of the chapters in my recent books that a full accounting of their
meaning is impossible for a short article. Some of the ideas here were covered by the chapter
"Swords, Seals & Surviving to Saturday" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. 
This piece will focus on the following ideas:

  - Identifying the Seven Spirits of God by name
  - Matching each Spirit to one of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
  - Correlating the Seven Spirits with phases of the Harvest Pattern of Jesus
  - Recounting the four most prominent times in history when the Seven Spirits have been sent out into the earth

## Lanterns: Naming the Spirits

In four verses, Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6, we are told of the Seven Spirits of God.
An ancient Jewish tradition is that there are seven archangels, only two of whom (Gabriel and Michael)
are named in the Bible. Thus some people believe that the Seven Spirits of God are those seven 
archangels. A second interpretation (to which I subscribe) is that this is a reference to the Holy Spirit
which can communicate to people seven spiritual qualities, as defined by Isaiah:

#### There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
##### and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.
#### And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
#### the Spirit of wisdom and
##### understanding,
#### the Spirit of counsel and 
##### might,
#### the Spirit of knowledge and 
##### the fear of the Lord.
###### - Isaiah 11:1-2

This interpretation goes back at least as far as Saint Ambrose. He made the connection in chapter 16 of his treatise 
on the Holy Spirit, *De Spiritu Sancto*, ca 381 AD. (See [On the Holy Spirit (Book I)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34021.htm)) Many who make this connection extend the identity to include the seven pillars of wisdom.
With this equivalence I disagree. The two are related, pillars and spirits. A pillar is solid, material, and strong.
The Holy Spirit is not material but communicates strength to the beings that it inhabits.
Pillars are used as an analogy for people of strong faith who hold the church together by their maturity and courage.
To become a pillar in the temple of God (the promise of Revelation 3:12) requires two things. You need a person and you
need to fill them with strength of character. The pillars of wisdom are the spiritual and conceptual thing that is
added to a human to make them a pillar. Thus when we speak of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom we can either speak of people
who have been made into such pillars or the teachings that accomplished that transformation. Since there are millions
of potential pillar people but only seven categories of quality that each needs, the most sensible thing is to say that
the pillars are those spiritual qualities that the Holy Spirit communicates. But what are those qualities? How are they 
defined and how do they relate to each other? By what authority and cohesive integrity do these pillars accomplish 
this feat? Only the Word of God has the clarity and force to accomplish this task. Thus the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
must be some subset of the Bible that when applied by the Holy Spirit to the soul of the believer inculcates those
qualities.

My research argues that those seven pillars of wisdom are the seven Bible books Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, 
Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. It also concludes that each pillar book must be illuminated so that the 
believer can understand it, act upon it and be transformed by it. That illumination is the work of the Seven Spirits of God.
Each spirit (really just distinct activities of the one Holy Spirit) illuminates one pillar. It is like a 
lamp mounted on the pillar to light the path to understanding. This analogy is not of my own invention:

#### From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings
#### and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning 
#### **seven torches of fire**, which are **the seven spirits of God**...
###### - Revelation 4:5

The beauty of these torches is that they concisely describe a goal that each of these Bible books was crafted 
to accomplish for us. The fact that they provide such clarity is evidence that the selection of books
is correct and they are ordered in a meaningful way. I derived my ordered list of the seven pillar books before 
concluding that each matched a spirit of God. My principal reason for the order was different - it made the pillar books 
conform to the Harvest Pattern of Jesus. The fact that these two ways of looking at the books produced the same 
order cannot be a coincidence.

## Matching Spirits to the Pillars in Lady Wisdom's House

The Bible's seven pillar books supply the clues that allow us to match each to a spirit.
Let's walk through the books and see what they have to say.

**Psalms**. The first spirit - *the spirit of the Lord* - goes with the Psalms. The obvious clue is that the Hebrew word 
for *Lord* appears more often in Psalms than in any other book. In my NIV concordance, that is 717 times. 
The other clue is how the Psalms liken the Word of God to the light of a lamp:

#### For it is you who light my lamp; 
##### the Lord my God lightens my darkness.
###### - Psalm 18:28

#### Your word is a lamp to my feet
##### and a light to my path.
###### - Psalm 119:105

Accepting Jesus as Lord is the basic, first step of the Christian life. The Psalms are a meditation on the Law,
and receiving that Law, those Ten Commandments, is the first step toward holiness.
Therefore the first spirit is the Spirit of Lordship.

**Job**. The second spirit - *the spirit of Wisdom* - goes with the Book of Job. The strongest basis for this 
association is found in Ecclesiastes, which tells us that the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning 
(Ecclesiastes 7:2,4). Job's declaration in Job 1:21 defines mourning as his baseline challenge:
*"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away..."* Thus Job lived in the House of Mourning.

The second basis for this association is Job 28, his paean to wisdom. He laments how nobody knows the path to wisdom,
the very thing he needs if his questions are to be answered and his life restored. God teaches us many things.
Wisdom is what he teaches us through suffering. Knowledge, gift of the sixth spirit, is the detailed knowledge of all things.
It builds upon wisdom but carries things much further.

**Proverbs**. The third spirit - *the spirit of Understanding* - goes with the Book of Proverbs. Our Bible concordance
helps us here as well. The words understood, understand, understands and understanding appear forty-three times in Proverbs, 
leaving Job with its thirty-one instances in second place. Given that there are three similar words used to 
name the spirits, wisdom, understanding and knowledge, it is important to "understand" the distinction. 
It was not until I studied the life of Joshua that I understood understanding. We shall get to that story in a
later section of this article, "Second Sending: With a Sword".

Understanding is all about heavenly treasure, spiritual values and worship. True worship is recognizing the true
value of things, worshiping the greater and rejecting the lesser. God is greatest, and so we are to worship him and no other.
The truth content of worship is how God communicates aspects of himself to us when we worship him. The insights
we receive as a result of worshiping the Lord guide us around and through difficulties.

Like Job in Job 28, Proverbs uses the metaphor of treasure extensively. The book speaks a lot about the desire for 
a wife, for money, property, and a high position in society. All its words of caution are about recognizing the value 
of those things but pointing to the greater value of wisdom and of God. Proverbs warns about how the worship of
wealth leads to theft, dishonesty and violence. The worship of women leads to sexual immorality and disgrace. 

This focus of Proverbs on worship was not obvious to me at first. How did that begin to change? 
During 1988, I read from Proverbs every day for six months. I turned that book into my prayer journal.
What I did not understand, I prayed to God to explain. When I failed in my attempts to apply many of the Proverbs
to my conduct, I prayed to God for forgiveness and the ability to change. By the end of that time, I found myself 
worshiping God through the Proverbs. Those Proverbs are a father's attempts to raise a wise son. Jesus is the only 
truly wise Son. By studying Proverbs, I was learning about who Jesus is.

That kind of worship changes you. That year, I truly met the Spirit of Understanding.

**Song of Songs**. The fourth spirit - *the spirit of Counsel* - goes with the Song of Songs, but really with all 
the prophets. The prophets were advisors sent by God to correct error, warn of judgment, and get people back on the 
right path, "the Way of Holiness" as Isaiah called it. In the poem, the Bride counsels her friends not to arouse or awaken 
love until it is time. Romantic advice is but one of the topics concerning which people need advice.

In my analysis of the Song of Songs in "Appendix G: A Prophetic Song of Songs" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, 
I related a surprising discovery. The twenty-eight speaking parts in the poem match the twenty-eight times from
Ecclesiastes 3 - sort of. In fifteen of the speeches, the exact opposite of the matching time is on display.
Thus the whole poem is advice about how young people tend to get the times of life out of sequence, always trying 
to do today something that they should hold off until they get older, like marrying too young.

The Bride also gets in trouble and is almost molested by bad characters when she wanders into the wrong place at 
the wrong time. The spirit of counsel is what we need to steer clear of unnecessary trouble.

**Ecclesiastes**. The fifth spirit - *the spirit of Might* - goes with Ecclesiastes. Given that this book
speaks relentlessly about time, how is it different from the spirit of Counsel, which advised about making poor decisions
because the timing was wrong? This book and this spirit are about what happens when you get the timing and focus of your
life right. A dissolute, unfocused, disorganized person squanders their energy on every sort of activity.
They lack a sense of priorities. They squander their energy and so become weak and ineffective in life.
I know what that is like!

God plucks, prunes, and disciplines us until we have a productive focus for our life. Solomon, the author,
was a king. He planted vineyards, built houses and a temple, ruled with justice, waged war, negotiated with foreign kings, 
and managed affairs of every sort. He is a good example of an effective, focused person, a person of might.
In Ecclesiastes 9, we find one of the core statements of the book. The wise king gives a charge to live
a life where you consistently spend your might towards worthy goals:

#### Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, 
##### **for God has already approved what you do**.
#### Let your garments be always white. 
#### Let not oil be lacking on your head.
#### Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days 
##### of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, 
##### because that is your portion in life and in your toil 
##### at which you toil under the sun. 
#### **Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might**, 
##### for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom 
##### in Sheol, to which you are going.
###### - Ecclesiastes 9:7-10

These words are so deep, I shall never reach the bottom. We do things that seem vain and meaningless,
but they have been approved by God for us to do, which means that they are not.
One of the greatest life-changing truths I ever got from the Bible was that we do not work hard
to earn God's approval. We work hard because we already have God's approval (once we are saved). 
His favor produces good works, not the other way around. When I learned in the Fall of 1985 that I was 
accepted by the Lord despite having nothing to show for my efforts in this world, I found peace. 
**Not having to earn God's love is a huge relief. The heart so unburdened finds the might to do great things.**

**Matthew**. The sixth spirit - *the spirit of Knowledge* - goes with Matthew. The word knowledge does not even appear
in Matthew, but that book is filled with the most important knowledge we have been given: knowledge about
our savior's life and teachings. It remained to Paul to tell us what we need to know to make this
assignment, that Christ possesses all knowledge:

#### For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you
#### and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen
#### me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, 
#### being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of 
#### full assurance of understanding and the **knowledge** 
#### of God's mystery, which is **Christ, in whom are hidden** 
#### **all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge**.
###### - Colossians 2:1-3

**Revelation**. The seventh spirit - *the spirit of the Fear of the Lord* - goes with Revelation.
This book reveals the trials of seals, trumpets, earthquakes and bowl judgments in which God pours out His full
wrath upon the inhabitants of the earth. Those events will finally teach the whole world to fear the Lord.

By these arguments, it is sensible to associate each spirit with the books so named.
There are other reasons for not associating other books with a spirit.
The principle reason is that these seven books conform to the Growth and Harvest Patterns which mark them
as pillar books, whereas other books do not. 

NOTE: Paul's first seven letters come close. Each corresponds to one phase of the Growth Pattern; 
no single book matches them all. They form the roof of Lady Wisdom's house,
not pillars. The presence of the Growth Pattern in the letters collectively shows that the roof
fits on top of the pillars. See [The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program](./pauls-discipleship-program.html) 
for the analysis of those letters in terms of the Growth Pattern.

## The Seven Spirits and the Harvest Pattern

[The Harvest Pattern of Jesus](./harvest-pattern.html) has seven phases and there are seven spirits of God. 
It was therefore natural to ask the question, "Does each spirit go with one phase of the harvest?"
The short answer is that they fit. However, the nature of that fit raises another question as we shall see.

<hr/>

|        Spirit        |     Phase           | Connection |
| :------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------- |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Lordship          | Preparation         | Acknowledging Christ as Lord and being trained <br/> in the Ten Commandments is the necessary <br/> preparation for any harvest. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Wisdom            | Plowing             | Plowing is suffering, and through patiently suffering <br/> in faith we receive wisdom from God, <br/> just like Job. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
| Understanding        | Planting Seed       | The seed of the gospel must be accepted, <br/> not lost to the birds. <br/> We accept it through worship, <br/> which is the foundation of understanding. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Counsel           | Pouring Water       | The Holy Spirit is the Counselor (John 14:26), <br/> and washing hearts with pure water <br/> to produce holiness is his forte. <br/> The sun-beaten, rocky soil of our hearts <br/> must be turned to flesh (Ezekiel 36:26) and watered. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Might             | Plucking Weeds      | Pruning branches and plucking weeds is hard work. <br/> For it, you need strength. <br/> The result is a focused, disciplined life. <br/> By not squandering your energies on fruitless diversions, <br/> you grow strong for the work God has set before you. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|   Knowledge          | Producing a Harvest | The harvest requires knowledge to bring in and <br/> the result of the harvest is increased knowledge. <br/> Jesus is the Lord of the Harvest, so <br/> the connection between knowledge, harvesting and the Gospel of Matthew <br/> is strong. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
| The Fear of the Lord | Peace               | This is the tricky connection, to be discussed below.  |

<hr/>

The most perplexing thing about the ordering of the Spirits is the placement of the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord
in last place. Remember, the Bible teaches that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" 
(Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 9:10) or of knowledge (Proverbs 1:7). Why does it not come first?

In Ecclesiastes, the fear of God shows up in the argument in chapters 3, 5, 7, 8, 12 
and is part of the conclusion:

#### The end of the matter; 
##### all has been heard. 
#### **Fear God** and keep his commandments, 
##### for this is the whole duty of man.".
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:13

It appears that the Fear of the Lord is integral to every phase of the Christian life.
Is there something distinct that the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord does when 
we get to the end of a harvest?  One wonderful Bible verse that ties together several 
of these ideas is in Acts:

#### So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria 
#### had **peace** and was being **built up**. 
#### And walking in the **fear of the Lord**
#### and in the **comfort of the Holy Spirit**, it **multiplied**.
###### - Acts 9:31

You can sense the complex and powerful dynamic that was causing the church to grow at that time.
The trick is to understand the causal connections and see the process. Not all verses show process; 
they list ideas in a different order to serve a different purpose. For example:

#### if you seek it like silver
##### and search for it as for hidden treasures,
#### then you will understand the fear of the Lord
##### and find the knowledge of God.
###### - Proverbs 2:4-5

If you take that verse to imply causation, then the fear of the Lord should come before knowledge. 
An alternate reading is that the earlier phrase is really about the spirit of understanding,
for you are made to "understand the fear of the Lord". That would mean that the final appearance 
of the Fear of the Lord in sequence is to empower a people that has already been trained to love it, 
learn from it and walk in it. A people so discipled will produce so much fruit, experience so much
miraculous provision from God, that the world will take notice and give way before them in fear,
knowing that such a people has the protection of God and cannot be destroyed.

## The Sending Out of the Seven Spirits

#### And between the throne and the four living creatures 
#### and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, 
#### as though it had been slain, 
#### with seven horns and with seven eyes, 
#### which are **the seven spirits of God** 
#### **sent out into all the earth**.
###### - Revelation 5:6

On reading the above verse, several questions come to mind.

  - When were the Seven Spirits sent out? 
  - Were they sent out all at once or in a particular order?
  - Were they sent out once or many times, for different missions?
  - When sent out, what was the purpose of their sending?

All these questions have answers, and finding them was a pleasant surprise. 
The one question that is unanswered is how many times the spirits have been sent out. 
I suspect the number is huge. We don't need to know about all their missions, though.
The Bible has given us evidence of at least four:

  - To assist with the creation of the world
  - To execute key judgments against humanity throughout history and so advance God's plan of salvation at the longest time scale
  - To discipline and train believers during the church age
  - To assist with the final judgment of mankind during the time of the Great Tribulation

The reason that we are able to make this determination is because each time the spirits were sent out in 
the order they are listed in Isaiah and they influence the character of the activities that occur in each phase.
By studying the events and reflecting on the details of each step, we can detect which spirit was at work
and so confirm the pattern.

Once you see these pattens in salvation history, you will have proof that this sequence is powerful and important.
Then you will gain confidence that attuning yourself to the seven spirits will enable you to gain insight into 
what God is doing in your life right now, and how you can cooperate with the Holy Spirit's work.

## First Sending: During the Days of Creation

**Day 1**: *Let there be light...* In Revelation 4:5, the spirits are called "seven torches of fire". 
In Genesis 1:2, "the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters." 
Thus we know from the text that the Holy Spirit is present and participating in the creation of light.
God is introduced as the creator. The most important point being made is that He is the Lord of creation,
who initiated and governed every aspect of its manufacture. This is the **spirit of the Lord**, or Lordship.

**Day 2**: *The heavens, sky and the separation of the waters.* This is the only day of which it was not said
that God saw that it was good. There is a correspondence between the days of creation and the millennia
of history. The second millennia is when the great flood occurred, another event involving water. 
That millennia saw great wickedness, flood, the tower of Babel and the beginnings of slavery. 
That millennia was full of suffering, and it is suffering that produces wisdom. That is
why we can see the presence of the **spirit of Wisdom** here. Wisdom is about making distinctions.
The waters were separated. The water of the Heavens was separated from the waters of the earth.
This expanse of separation signifies the great distance between us and God.
It was that distance that tormented Job and forced him to come to grips with God's ways.

**Day 3**: *Dry ground, seeds, plants and fruit trees.* The planting phase of the harvest pattern is obvious.
The **spirit of understanding** is tied up in worship. Though plants are not very smart, they are the first living
things upon the face of the earth, the first things that can respond to the good world that God has given them.

**Day 4**: *Sun, moon and stars.* The **spirit of counsel**, as evidenced in Song of Songs, 
is about giving advice about what to do and when. The when requires us to plan our days, to measure them.
That would not be possible without God's heavenly timepieces, which govern the days, seasons, and years.

**Day 5**: *Fish and birds.* The **spirit of might** is all about giving out a noble task, and 
fostering the focus and strength needed to complete that task without giving in to distraction or laziness.   
For the first time in creation, such a task is assigned by God to his creatures:

#### And God blessed them, saying, 
##### “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, 
##### and let birds multiply on the earth.”
###### - Genesis 1:22

This is the day when the great sea serpent, Leviathan, was created, which would come to symbolize 
strong and terrible empires. God said of this creature:

#### In his neck abides strength, 
##### and terror dances before him."
###### - Job 41:22

#### Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, 
##### nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin.
###### - Job 41:26

Yes, might dwells in the sea.

**Day 6**: *The animals and mankind.* The **spirit of knowledge** waited until day 6 to arrive,
for none of God's material creations has the capacity to acquire knowledge to the extent that
humans can. Furthermore, Jesus would one day become the only man filled with all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Also, this knowledge is about producing a harvest and having dominion over the earth, 
and Adam's task was to till the earth and do just that.

**Day 7**: *God rested*. The sequencing of events in Genesis 2 is tricky. It seems to back up and give 
additional details of the creation, before moving forward again. Thus it is difficult to determine whether 
the command to not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was given on day 6, day 7 or later. 
However, textually the command was given following the description of the seventh day when God rested, 
the first sabbath. The command and its associated punishment of death is the first place
in the Bible where a note of fear is introduced. Thus this is when the **spirit of the Fear of the Lord** entered the scene.

One might counter that it is impossible for God to divide himself, to express wisdom only on day two, or
might only on day five. That is not the point. Some people argue that God created the universe instantly,
that it is an affront to His glory to say that it took Him a whole seven days to complete the job.
God does what He does, emphasizing one thing here and another thing there, because He is a teacher
to creatures that are not infinite. Thus the story of the creation shows traces of the work of each 
spirit spread out among the days so that we can see that there is an order to things in God's economy,
and we should imitate Him if we want to be productive in our lives.

## Second Sending: With a Sword 

Ephesians 6:17 refers to the *"the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God".* 
Hebrews 4:12 says that* "the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword".*
This powerful image tells us that the power of God's Word is wielded like a sword by the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit wields that sword every day, but there are special occasions when the powerful effects
of this swordplay overturn empires and change the course of history. The Bible takes note of
these events and we can learn from them.

This section will reproduce part of the chapter "Swords, Seals & Surviving to Saturday" from *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. 
The basic idea is that while the Bible often refers to swords, only a few of them
are in a miraculous context. Those mentions of swords are spaced out in history, one per millennium.
In each case, the events surrounding that sword are indicative of one of the seven spirits of God.

### Swords, Seals & Surviving to Saturday (Part A)

Everybody's working for the weekend, at least that is what the band Loverboy told us in their 1981 hit
song. If all of history is likened to a week and we call the creation “Sunday”, then the day of rest, 
the day Christ returns, is “Saturday”. The question for us all is: will we survive until Saturday? 
Will we make it to the weekend?

### Seven Swords (sans Samurai)

The church of Pergamum faced God’s double-edged sword in its day, as we learned in the chapter 
“Seven Churches for Seven Eras” of *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. That was no aberration. 
God drew His sword in Eden and will not sheath it until the final victory is won
on the Saturday of world history, when weekend will become world’s end. 
He wields that sword against the world’s unrighteousness every day, and we should fear it.

To reach peace we must pass through war. As I write, it is Veteran’s Day, 2020. 
What got me fixated on swords today? I was reading about the cherubim in the Garden of Eden.
After that, I just had to see if there was a pattern to discover. 
Men in the Bible are forever drawing swords, but God is sparing with significant references to this weapon.
There are seven.

**Sunday**. Today, the cherubim guarding the Tree of Life in Eden wield a flaming sword, 
to keep Adam and Eve out after they fell from grace. That sword means exile. (Genesis 3:24)

**Monday**. Methuselah’s name may mean “man of the sword” or “sting of death”. (Genesis 5) 
Commencing with his death on this day, God wields a sword in the form of the flood, 
sparing only Noah’s family. After the flood, God delegates to humans the power of the
sword: authority to execute murderers and establish
human government. (Genesis 9)

**Tuesday**. On the way to Jericho today, Joshua sees a man with a drawn sword in his hand. 
It is the commander of the army of the Lord, believed to be the preincarnate Christ. 
God commands Joshua to wage war against evil peoples and grants Israel victory. ( Joshua 5:13-15)

**Wednesday**. Today Israel turns away from God, so it is time for her to face God’s sword: 
the words of the prophets. Swords of judgment are spoken of in Isaiah (18 times), 
Jeremiah and Lamentations (68 times), and Ezekiel (82 times). Their 148 warnings are ignored and
Judah goes into exile.

**Thursday**. Today Emperor Constantine sees the sign of the cross and makes it into a sword hilt. 
Under that sign he conquers. Church and empire become entangled, earning a rebuke from Jesus 
in his letter to the church of Pergamum. He threatens them with his double-edged sword. (Revelation 2:12,16)

**Friday**. Today the wars of religion rage throughout 16th and 17th century Europe, and by the 18th
century, the whole world. “Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power 
to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.” (Revelation 6:4, NIV)

**Saturday**. Victory!

#### I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse,
#### whose rider is called Faithful and True.
#### With justice he judges and wages war. His eyes are like blazing fire, 
#### and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that 
#### no one knows but he himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, 
#### and his name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven were 
#### following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, 
####  white and clean. Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which 
#### to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” 
#### He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. 
####  On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written:
##### king of kings and lord of lords. 
###### - Revelation 19:11-16, NIV

Employing the days of the week was no gimmick. If you divide history into seven prophetic “days”, 
each a thousand years long (as in prior chapters), the divine sword makes one appearance each day. 
One. What does this mean? It means that the judicial sevens of Revelation spill over into
the whole Bible. Will we survive until Saturday? Can the church hold out until the day of victory?

**Joshua solves a riddle**. Not convinced? When I share with others some of the ideas in this book, 
a common response is, “Why would God hide important messages behind such complex riddles? 
How does He expect us to act on things we cannot understand?” By assuming it is not in
God’s character to do such a thing, they are able to reject any and all interpretations of such riddles. 
To this argument they add, “And if such riddles are there, how come no great theologians or holy people 
of the past have found and solved them before?” Since I am neither a great theologian nor a particularly 
holy person, that means that I ought not be able to unravel such mysteries, therefore have not.

Those criticisms got me thinking – but not to defend my great wisdom or worthiness. 
Maybe there were holy people who did discover parts of this riddle and acted on it. 
They got it. They believed. They benefited. Then it only falls to us to recognize their insight 
and follow their example. For such an example we need look no farther than Joshua.
Something about Joshua puzzled me for years. When Joshua saw the man with the drawn sword approaching
(in Joshua 5:13-15), after challenging him, why did he submit without question?
Why did a mighty general kneel before a stranger and trust him to be an angel? 
There is no indication of any miracle being performed. No flashing white robes. No thundering voice.

Why? Because Joshua knew the Word of God:

#### “See now that I myself am he!
#### There is no god besides me.
#### **I put to death and I bring to life,**
#### **I have wounded and I will heal,**
#### and no one can deliver out of my hand.
#### I lift my hand to heaven and solemnly swear:
#### As surely as I live forever,
#### **when I sharpen my flashing sword**
#### and my hand grasps it in judgment,
#### I will take vengeance on my adversaries
#### and repay those who hate me.
###### - Deuteronomy 32:39-41, NIV

The pairs of death and life, wound and heal remind me
of Ecclesiastes. That passage is about knowing the times
God has set. The above is from a song that Moses taught the
people to sing – and Joshua stood right next to him when
they were first spoken. Moses gave these instructions to all
Israel after he finished reciting it:

#### Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this
#### song in the hearing of the people. When Moses finished reciting all
#### these words to all Israel, he said to them, 
##### "Take to heart all the words
##### I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command
##### your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. They are
##### not just idle words for you—they are your life. By them you will
##### live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
###### - Deuteronomy 32:44-47, NIV

It was right after Joshua crossed the Jordan and entered
the Promised Land but before the crucial conquest of
Jericho that the man with the sword appeared. By faith
Joshua knew that the man with the sword was fulfilling the
words from Moses’ song. He knew that believing,
understanding and acting on Moses’ words meant
submitting to that man’s authority, because the sword was
God’s flashing sword and the time was now. Those words
were his life and ensured the victory of Israel.

**Back to Revelation**. A complete analysis of Revelation is
worth another book, but there is value in tackling the seven
seals. The Apostle John is shown (in Revelation 5) a scroll
with seven seals. No one can read the scroll until it is
unsealed. After a search is made for one worthy to open the
seals binding the heavenly scroll, only Jesus qualifies. In
chapter six, Jesus begins to open the seals. The first four
seals opened release the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

When? When will the dread horsemen ride? Some
believers schedule them in the distant future. Some
relegate them to the distant past. The rest do not expect
one single fulfillment of these words: war, famine
pestilence and death will strike our world repeatedly.

God’s revelations are like fractals. The same pattern can
repeat at a larger scale and a smaller one. There *may* be an
intense seven-year tribulation in our future. There *certainly*
is a tribulation today.

While formulating my eschatological (i.e. end times)
framework, I gave no thought to the seven seals, trumpets
and bowls of Revelation. There was already too much
material to wrestle with in Ecclesiastes and Job. However,
when I noticed the pattern of seven swords, it connected
three times to Revelation: to the seven churches, the seven
seals and the final battle. There is no escaping the seals.
Serendipitously, they confirm the work leading up to it. The
seven seals (a spiritual clock) do not contradict the other
clocks.


**Seven Swords for Seven Spirits**

Why make a big deal about the seven swords if they are
not explicitly addressed in Scripture? Look closer and you
will see that they are, if interpreted carefully:

#### Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the
#### center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures 
#### and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, 
#### which are the **seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth**.
###### - Revelation 5:6

The sending of the seven spirits out into the earth
preceded the opening of the seven seals. Could the seven
swords and the seven spirits be related? Recall the
characteristics of those seven spirits:

#### The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—
#### the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
#### the Spirit of counsel and of might,
#### the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the LORD—
###### - Isaiah 11:2

**Lord**. By disobeying a command, Adam and Eve rejected
God as Lord. Lordship is the first quality of the seven
spirits. Did this first sword accomplish God’s purpose? This
verse, from a later time during the first millennium, tells us
that it did:

#### Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. 
#### At that time **people began to call on** 
#### **the name of the LORD**. 
###### - Genesis 4:26, NIV

The full flowering of this movement to follow God as Lord occurred
during this millennium, with the birth of Enoch who began to 
*“walk faithfully with God”* (Genesis 5:22,24) and was taken up 
to heaven without dying at the millennium’s close.

**Wisdom**. The judgment by flood exhibited God’s unfathomable wisdom, 
the second quality. He saved the earth by destroying it, drew mankind 
closer to eternal life by shortening our maximum lifespan, and protected life by
establishing capital punishment.

This was when God decreed the length of a generation to
be one hundred twenty years, defining the timescale for all
remaining history to follow. Wisdom is all about time, and it is 
communicated through suffering. With the flood, Tower of Babel and the advent of slavery,
what millennia ever saw so much suffering as this one?

**Understanding**. The key to Joshua’s victory over Jericho
was not strength of arms, it was worship.

#### Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man
#### standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua
#### went up to him and asked, 
##### “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
#### “Neither,” he replied, “but as commander of the army of the LORD I
#### have now come.” 
#### Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, 
##### “What message does my Lord have for his servant?”
#### The commander of the LORD’s army replied, 
##### “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” 
#### And Joshua did so. 
###### - Joshua 5:13-15, NIV

After that, the people obediently marched seven times
around the city, blew their trumpets, and the walls of
Jericho fell.

To understand the value and power of worship requires
the Spirit. The connection to worship was not at all obvious
to me until I found it in the song Moses taught the people in
Deuteronomy 32. As related a few pages ago, it was in the
words of a worship song that God delivered the prophesy of
the coming of the man with the sword. It was by being a
true worshiper of God that Joshua recognized the signs and
made the correct decision to submit to the strange man
with the sword. True worship gave him understanding.

Six times the Bible mentions a double-edged sword:
Judges 3:16, Psalm 149:6, Proverbs 5:4, Hebrews 4:12, and
Revelation 1:16 and 2:12 . All are relevant to this discussion.
Later in this third millennium, we find the first mention of a
double-edged sword, in Judges 3:16. Ehud the Judge
deceived their enemy, Eglon, King of Moab, and killed him
with that sword. While not so flashy as a sword-wielding
angel, it allows us to make important connections to the
Psalms and Revelation. Psalm 149 reinforces the connection
between the sword and worship:

#### May the praise of God be in their mouths 
#### and a double-edged sword in their hands…
###### - Psalm 149:6, NIV

Hebrews contains the answer key that defines the
meaning of the prophetic sword for us:

#### For the word of God is alive and active. 
#### Sharper than any **double-edged sword**, 
#### it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, 
#### joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts 
#### and attitudes of the heart.
###### - Hebrews 4:12

Then in Revelation, we find a connection between this
time and the letters to the churches. Remember, we have
been discussing the third millennium. There is some sense
in which the seven letters also correspond to the seven
millennia of history through the mediating pattern of the
harvest. At the end of the letter to the third church, the
Church of Pergamum, Jesus says, 
*“Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches...” *
(Revelation 2:17) Thus if there are seven spirits of wisdom sent into the
world and the Spirit addresses seven churches, we should
expect aspects of each spirit to be distributed, one to each
church. In the case of Pergamum, the connection is clear:

#### “To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: 
##### These are the words of him who has the sharp, 
##### **double-edged sword…** Repent therefore!
##### Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will 
##### fight against them with the **sword of my mouth**.
###### - Revelation 2:12,16

The connection to the wisdom of true worship is made
clear only by reflection on history. Pergamum the city was
home to a pagan temple to Athena, a false goddess of
wisdom. Pergamum the church era was dominated by
crises over true worship but concluded with the
construction of the Hagia Sophia, for over 900 years the
grandest place of worship in Christendom. Its name meant
“Holy Wisdom” and it was commissioned by Justinian, an
emperor who tirelessly wielded the sword against the
enemies of Christ.

As a cautionary tale, returning to Joshua’s day we have
the story of Balaam and his donkey, in Numbers 22. The
Angel of the Lord also appeared with a drawn sword before
Balaam. This practicer of divination was intent on offering
immoral sacrifices – false worship – to curse Israel in order
to get money from Balak. The man’s donkey was a wise
servant who saw the armed angel and refused to advance
lest his master be killed. Balaam was a fool, who did not see
the angel at first and beat his donkey for not moving, and
so was rushing headlong toward death. False worship
produces blindness. It prevents understanding.

Sadly, those without understanding are still capable of
spreading disaster:

#### For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
#### and her speech is smoother than oil;
#### but in the end she is bitter as gall,
#### **sharp as a double-edged sword**.
###### - Proverbs 5:3-4, NIV

Adultery is used as a metaphor for idolatry, for false
worship. When the Moabites and Midianites could not
defeat Israel by force of arms or by pronouncing
supernatural curses, Balaam in Numbers counseled them to
entice Israel by sending women to seduce them, knowing
that this would compel a righteous God to turn against
Israel. It worked. Many in Israel died because of the
incident involving the Baal of Peor.

Thus the third quality of understanding was dispatched,
one not everyone can see. These two tales finally converge
in Joshua 13:22, when Balaam the diviner fell before Israel’s
sword.

**Counsel**. Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel as well as the
minor prophets counseled the people to repent before it
was too late, but they mostly refused. One who did heed
the message was Jehoshaphat, in 2 Chronicles 20, who
humbled himself by praying, fasting and prostrating
himself before the Lord. The king trusted the counsel of
God’s prophet, Jahaziel, son of Benaiah, and marched out
against a superior force, yet was victorious. At the head of
his army marched worshipers, not soldiers, and they
carried the day.

Isaiah told his people what the seven spirits were, but to
to what avail? In the end, the consequences forecast for
refusing God’s counsel came to pass. Judah was conquered
and sent into exile. The counsel of the prophets was the
fourth spirit sent into the world.


**Might**. The spirit was sent to Constantine, and in
response, the might of the longest surviving empire in
world history was placed at the disposal of Christ’s church.
The fifth spirit was sent to Rome. However, the drawing of
this sword did not start with Constantine, but at Pentecost.
On that day the baptism of the Holy Spirit was poured out
upon the church, imbuing it with power.

This is the sword prophesied by Jesus:

#### “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.
#### I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. 
###### - Matthew 10:34, NIV

**Knowledge**. The Protestant Reformation unlocked the
truth that we are saved by grace alone through faith alone.
This knowledge and the freedom and courage it inspired
led to an explosion in education and scientific knowledge of
every kind. The sixth spirit sparked the scientific
revolution. This sword was drawn in Revelation 6:4. The
explosion in knowledge also made war deadlier.

**The Fear of the Lord**. The seventh and last spirit is yet
to come. When the last plagues are unleashed, the seven
bowls and seven woes of Revelation, then mankind will
finally fear the Lord.

**The Sharpest Sword**. The qualitative analysis of the
seven swords leaves an important thing unsaid. Where and
when were the greatest number of references to swords
found? The place was in Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; the
time was during the day of the Spirit of Counsel. That is the
era of the heart. Humanity is weak in mind and strength,
but our greatest deficiency is in our heart. Jeremiah said we
need new hearts to please God.

Who can comprehend all that these many swords have to
say to us? The Bible has a habit of directing our attention to
the first, middle or last in a series. The first use of a double-
edged sword by Ehud is significant, as is the last in
Revelation. The first mention of any sword in Genesis was
significant. What is the last sword spoken of by an Old
Testament prophet? That depends on how you define “Old
Testament Prophet”. Jesus considered John the Baptist the
last and greatest of the Old Testament prophets. Thus any
prophet that arose before Jesus was baptized was an Old
Testament prophet. By this definition, the last prophet to
speak of a sword was Simeon.

#### Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: 
##### “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising 
##### of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, 
##### so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. 
##### **And a sword will pierce your own soul too.**”
###### - Luke 2:34-35, NIV

The piercing of Mary’s soul was to see her son and savior die
on the cross. If this is the apotheosis of all the sword
references in the Bible, then we must ponder what it means.
If the sword of the Spirit is the Word of God, and it is a
double-edged sword that can separate soul and spirit, then it
is a powerful agent that reveals our hearts. We do not want
our dark thoughts and passions and plans laid bare, but we
must submit to this surgery. I well remember the soul-pain of
seeing my folly exposed as a young man, and the sword has
not completed its final incision.

Yes, we must ponder this – and receive it in the spirit that
Simeon gave it, as a blessing. Only by faith can we regard
such a prick as the event that will make us rise.

## Third Sending: To Teach the Seven Churches

In Revelation, Jesus dictates to John messages for seven different churches in Asia.
One common understanding of the letters is that they apply both to seven literal churches
that then existed, but also apply to seven eras of church history. In the following,
consider that each letter is written in a different spirit and has been applied at least
twice in history.
