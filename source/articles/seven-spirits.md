## Abstract

The Seven Spirits of God spoken of by John in Revelation are enigmatic. 
They factor into so many of the chapters in my recent books that a full accounting of their
meaning is impossible for a short article. Some of the ideas here were covered by the chapter
"Swords, Seals & Surviving to Saturday" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. 
This piece will focus on the following ideas:

  - Identifying the Seven Spirits of God by name
  - Matching each Spirit to one of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
  - Correlating the Seven Spirits with phases of the Harvest Pattern of Jesus
  - Recounting the four most prominent times in history when the Seven Spirits have been sent out into the earth

## Lanterns: Naming the Spirits

In four verses, Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6, we are told of the Seven Spirits of God.
An ancient Jewish tradition is that there are seven archangels, only two of whom (Gabriel and Michael)
are named in the Bible. Thus some people believe that the Seven Spirits of God are those seven 
archangels. A second interpretation (to which I subscribe) is that this is a reference to the Holy Spirit
which can communicate to people seven spiritual qualities, as defined by Isaiah:

#### There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
##### and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.
#### And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
#### the Spirit of wisdom and
##### understanding,
#### the Spirit of counsel and 
##### might,
#### the Spirit of knowledge and 
##### the fear of the Lord.
###### - Isaiah 11:1-2

This interpretation goes back at least as far as Saint Ambrose. He made the connection in chapter 16 of his treatise 
on the Holy Spirit, *De Spiritu Sancto*, ca 381 AD. (See [On the Holy Spirit (Book I)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34021.htm)) Many who make this connection extend the identity to include the seven pillars of wisdom.
With this equivalence I disagree. The two are related, pillars and spirits. A pillar is solid, material, and strong.
The Holy Spirit is not material but communicates strength to the beings that it inhabits.
Pillars are used as an analogy for people of strong faith who hold the church together by their maturity and courage.
To become a pillar in the temple of God (the promise of Revelation 3:12) requires two things. You need a person and you
need to fill them with strength of character. The pillars of wisdom are the spiritual and conceptual thing that is
added to a human to make them a pillar. Thus when we speak of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom we can either speak of people
who have been made into such pillars or the teachings that accomplished that transformation. Since there are millions
of potential pillar people but only seven categories of quality that each needs, the most sensible thing is to say that
the pillars are those spiritual qualities that the Holy Spirit communicates. But what are those qualities? How are they 
defined and how do they relate to each other? By what authority and cohesive integrity do these pillars accomplish 
this feat? Only the Word of God has the clarity and force to accomplish this task. Thus the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
must be some subset of the Bible that when applied by the Holy Spirit to the soul of the believer inculcates those
qualities.

My research argues that those seven pillars of wisdom are the seven Bible books Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, 
Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. It also concludes that each pillar book must be illuminated so that the 
believer can understand it, act upon it and be transformed by it. That illumination is the work of the Seven Spirits of God.
Each spirit (really just distinct activities of the one Holy Spirit) illuminates one pillar. It is like a 
lamp mounted on the pillar to light the path to understanding. This analogy is not of my own invention:

#### From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings
#### and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning 
#### **seven torches of fire**, which are **the seven spirits of God**...
###### - Revelation 4:5

The beauty of these torches is that they concisely describe a goal that each of these Bible books was crafted 
to accomplish for us. The fact that they provide such clarity is evidence that the selection of books
is correct and they are ordered in a meaningful way. I derived my ordered list of the seven pillar books before 
concluding that each matched a spirit of God. My principal reason for the order was different - it made the pillar books 
conform to the Harvest Pattern of Jesus. The fact that these two ways of looking at the books produced the same 
order cannot be a coincidence.

## Matching Spirits to the Pillars in Lady Wisdom's House

The Bible's seven pillar books supply the clues that allow us to match each to a spirit.
Let's walk through the books and see what they have to say.

**Psalms**. The first spirit - *the spirit of the Lord* - goes with the Psalms. The obvious clue is that the Hebrew word 
for *Lord* appears more often in Psalms than in any other book. In my NIV concordance, that is 717 times. 
The other clue is how the Psalms liken the Word of God to the light of a lamp:

#### For it is you who light my lamp; 
##### the Lord my God lightens my darkness.
###### - Psalm 18:28

#### Your word is a lamp to my feet
##### and a light to my path.
###### - Psalm 119:105

Accepting Jesus as Lord is the basic, first step of the Christian life. The Psalms are a meditation on the Law,
and receiving that Law, those Ten Commandments, is the first step toward holiness.
Therefore the first spirit is the Spirit of Lordship.

**Job**. The second spirit - *the spirit of Wisdom* - goes with the Book of Job. The strongest basis for this 
association is found in Ecclesiastes, which tells us that the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning 
(Ecclesiastes 7:2,4). Job's declaration in Job 1:21 defines mourning as his baseline challenge:
*"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away..."* Thus Job lived in the House of Mourning.

The second basis for this association is Job 28, his paean to wisdom. He laments how nobody knows the path to wisdom,
the very thing he needs if his questions are to be answered and his life restored. God teaches us many things.
Wisdom is what he teaches us through suffering. Knowledge, gift of the sixth spirit, is the detailed knowledge of all things.
It builds upon wisdom but carries things much further.

**Proverbs**. The third spirit - *the spirit of Understanding* - goes with the Book of Proverbs. Our Bible concordance
helps us here as well. The words understood, understand, understands and understanding appear forty-three times in Proverbs, 
leaving Job with its thirty-one instances in second place. Given that there are three similar words used to 
name the spirits, wisdom, understanding and knowledge, it is important to "understand" the distinction. 
It was not until I studied the life of Joshua that I understood understanding. We shall get to that story in a
later section of this article, "Second Sending: With a Sword".

Understanding is all about heavenly treasure, spiritual values and worship. True worship is recognizing the true
value of things, worshiping the greater and rejecting the lesser. God is greatest, and so we are to worship him and no other.
The truth content of worship is how God communicates aspects of himself to us when we worship him. The insights
we receive as a result of worshiping the Lord guide us around and through difficulties.

Like Job in Job 28, Proverbs uses the metaphor of treasure extensively. The book speaks a lot about the desire for 
a wife, for money, property, and a high position in society. All its words of caution are about recognizing the value 
of those things but pointing to the greater value of wisdom and of God. Proverbs warns about how the worship of
wealth leads to theft, dishonesty and violence. The worship of women leads to sexual immorality and disgrace. 

This focus of Proverbs on worship was not obvious to me at first. How did that begin to change? 
During 1988, I read from Proverbs every day for six months. I turned that book into my prayer journal.
What I did not understand, I prayed to God to explain. When I failed in my attempts to apply many of the Proverbs
to my conduct, I prayed to God for forgiveness and the ability to change. By the end of that time, I found myself 
worshiping God through the Proverbs. Those Proverbs are a father's attempts to raise a wise son. Jesus is the only 
truly wise Son. By studying Proverbs, I was learning about who Jesus is.

That kind of worship changes you. That year, I truly met the Spirit of Understanding.

**Song of Songs**. The fourth spirit - *the spirit of Counsel* - goes with the Song of Songs, but really with all 
the prophets. The prophets were advisors sent by God to correct error, warn of judgment, and get people back on the 
right path, "the Way of Holiness" as Isaiah called it. In the poem, the Bride counsels her friends not to arouse or awaken 
love until it is time. Romantic advice is but one of the topics concerning which people need advice.

In my analysis of the Song of Songs in "Appendix G: A Prophetic Song of Songs" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, 
I related a surprising discovery. The twenty-eight speaking parts in the poem match the twenty-eight times from
Ecclesiastes 3 - sort of. In fifteen of the speeches, the exact opposite of the matching time is on display.
Thus the whole poem is advice about how young people tend to get the times of life out of sequence, always trying 
to do today something that they should hold off until they get older, like marrying too young.

The Bride also gets in trouble and is almost molested by bad characters when she wanders into the wrong place at 
the wrong time. The spirit of counsel is what we need to steer clear of unnecessary trouble.

**Ecclesiastes**. The fifth spirit - *the spirit of Might* - goes with Ecclesiastes. Given that this book
speaks relentlessly about time, how is it different from the spirit of Counsel, which advised about making poor decisions
because the timing was wrong? This book and this spirit are about what happens when you get the timing and focus of your
life right. A dissolute, unfocused, disorganized person squanders their energy on every sort of activity.
They lack a sense of priorities. They squander their energy and so become weak and ineffective in life.
I know what that is like!

God plucks, prunes, and disciplines us until we have a productive focus for our life. Solomon, the author,
was a king. He planted vineyards, built houses and a temple, ruled with justice, waged war, negotiated with foreign kings, 
and managed affairs of every sort. He is a good example of an effective, focused person, a person of might.
In Ecclesiastes 9, we find one of the core statements of the book. The wise king gives a charge to live
a life where you consistently spend your might towards worthy goals:

#### Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, 
##### **for God has already approved what you do**.
#### Let your garments be always white. 
#### Let not oil be lacking on your head.
#### Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days 
##### of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, 
##### because that is your portion in life and in your toil 
##### at which you toil under the sun. 
#### **Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might**, 
##### for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom 
##### in Sheol, to which you are going.
###### - Ecclesiastes 9:7-10

These words are so deep, I shall never reach the bottom. We do things that seem vain and meaningless,
but they have been approved by God for us to do, which means that they are not.
One of the greatest life-changing truths I ever got from the Bible was that we do not work hard
to earn God's approval. We work hard because we already have God's approval (once we are saved). 
His favor produces good works, not the other way around. When I learned in the Fall of 1985 that I was 
accepted by the Lord despite having nothing to show for my efforts in this world, I found peace. 
**Not having to earn God's love is a huge relief. The heart so unburdened finds the might to do great things.**

**Matthew**. The sixth spirit - *the spirit of Knowledge* - goes with Matthew. The word knowledge does not even appear
in Matthew, but that book is filled with the most important knowledge we have been given: knowledge about
our savior's life and teachings. It remained to Paul to tell us what we need to know to make this
assignment, that Christ possesses all knowledge:

#### For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you
#### and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen
#### me face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, 
#### being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of 
#### full assurance of understanding and the **knowledge** 
#### of God's mystery, which is **Christ, in whom are hidden** 
#### **all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge**.
###### - Colossians 2:1-3

**Revelation**. The seventh spirit - *the spirit of the Fear of the Lord* - goes with Revelation.
This book reveals the trials of seals, trumpets, earthquakes and bowl judgments in which God pours out His full
wrath upon the inhabitants of the earth. Those events will finally teach the whole world to fear the Lord.

By these arguments, it is sensible to associate each spirit with the books so named.
There are other reasons for not associating other books with a spirit.
The principle reason is that these seven books conform to the Growth and Harvest Patterns which mark them
as pillar books, whereas other books do not. 

NOTE: Paul's first seven letters come close. Each corresponds to one phase of the Growth Pattern; 
no single book matches them all. They form the roof of Lady Wisdom's house,
not pillars. The presence of the Growth Pattern in the letters collectively shows that the roof
fits on top of the pillars. See [The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program](./pauls-discipleship-program.html) 
for the analysis of those letters in terms of the Growth Pattern.

## The Seven Spirits and the Harvest Pattern

[The Harvest Pattern of Jesus](./harvest-pattern.html) has seven phases and there are seven spirits of God. 
It was therefore natural to ask the question, "Does each spirit go with one phase of the harvest?"
The short answer is that they fit. However, the nature of that fit raises another question as we shall see.

<hr/>

|        Spirit        |     Phase           | Connection |
| :------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------- |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Lordship          | Preparation         | Acknowledging Christ as Lord and being trained <br/> in the Ten Commandments is the necessary <br/> preparation for any harvest. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Wisdom            | Plowing             | Plowing is suffering, and through patiently suffering <br/> in faith we receive wisdom from God, <br/> just like Job. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
| Understanding        | Planting Seed       | The seed of the gospel must be accepted, <br/> not lost to the birds. <br/> We accept it through worship, <br/> which is the foundation of understanding. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Counsel           | Pouring Water       | The Holy Spirit is the Counselor (John 14:26), <br/> and washing hearts with pure water <br/> to produce holiness is his forte. <br/> The sun-beaten, rocky soil of our hearts <br/> must be turned to flesh (Ezekiel 36:26) and watered. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|    Might             | Plucking Weeds      | Pruning branches and plucking weeds is hard work. <br/> For it, you need strength. <br/> The result is a focused, disciplined life. <br/> By not squandering your energies on fruitless diversions, <br/> you grow strong for the work God has set before you. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
|   Knowledge          | Producing a Harvest | The harvest requires knowledge to bring in and <br/> the result of the harvest is increased knowledge. <br/> Jesus is the Lord of the Harvest, so <br/> the connection between knowledge, harvesting and the Gospel of Matthew <br/> is strong. |
|      <hr/>           |     <hr/>           |   <hr/>    | 
| The Fear of the Lord | Peace               | This is the tricky connection, to be discussed below.  |

The most perplexing thing about the ordering of the Spirits is the placement of the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord
in last place. Remember, the Bible teaches that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" 
(Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 9:10) or of knowledge (Proverbs 1:7). Why does it not come first?

In Ecclesiastes, the fear of God shows up in the argument in chapters 3, 5, 7, 8, 12 
and is part of the conclusion:

#### The end of the matter; 
##### all has been heard. 
#### **Fear God** and keep his commandments, 
##### for this is the whole duty of man.".
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:13

It appears that the Fear of the Lord is integral to every phase of the Christian life.
Is there something distinct that the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord does when 
we get to the end of a harvest?  One wonderful Bible verse that ties together several 
of these ideas is in Acts:

#### So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria 
#### had **peace** and was being **built up**. 
#### And walking in the **fear of the Lord**
#### and in the **comfort of the Holy Spirit**, it **multiplied**.
###### - Acts 9:31

You can sense the complex and powerful dynamic that was causing the church to grow at that time.
The trick is to understand the causal connections and see the process. Not all verses show process; 
they list ideas in a different order to serve a different purpose. For example:

#### if you seek it like silver
##### and search for it as for hidden treasures,
#### then you will understand the fear of the Lord
##### and find the knowledge of God.
###### - Proverbs 2:4-5

If you take that verse to imply causation, then the fear of the Lord should come before knowledge. 
An alternate reading is that the earlier phrase is really about the spirit of understanding,
for you are made to "understand the fear of the Lord". That would mean that the final appearance 
of the Fear of the Lord in sequence is to empower a people that has already been trained to love it, 
learn from it and walk in it. A people so discipled will produce so much fruit, experience so much
miraculous provision from God, that the world will take notice and give way before them in fear,
knowing that such a people has the protection of God and cannot be destroyed.
