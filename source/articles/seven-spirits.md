## Abstract

The Seven Pillars of God spoken of by John in Revelation are enigmatic. 
They factor into so many of the chapters in my recent books that a full accounting of their
meaning is impossible for a short article. This piece will focus on the following ideas:

  - Identifying the Seven Spirits of God by name
  - Matching each Spirit to one of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
  - Correlating the Seven Spirits with phases of the Harvest Pattern of Jesus
  - Recounting three times in history when the Seven Spirits have been sent out into the earth

## Lanterns: Naming the Spirits

In four verses, Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6, we are told of the Seven Spirits of God.
An ancient Jewish tradition is that there are seven archangels, only two of whom (Gabriel and Michael)
are named in the Bible. Thus some people believe that the Seven Spirits of God are those seven 
archangels. A second interpretation (to which I subscribe) is that this is a reference to the Holy Spirit
which can communicate to people seven spiritual qualities, as defined by Isaiah:

#### There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
##### and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.
#### And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
#### the Spirit of wisdom and
##### understanding,
#### the Spirit of counsel and 
##### might,
#### the Spirit of knowledge and 
##### the fear of the Lord.
###### - Isaiah 11:1-2

This interpretation goes back at least as far as Saint Ambrose. He made the connection in chapter 16 of his treatise 
on the Holy Spirit, *De Spiritu Sancto*, ca 381 AD. (See [On the Holy Spirit (Book I)](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34021.htm)) Many who make this connection extend the identity to include the seven pillars of wisdom.
With this equivalence I disagree. The two are related, pillars and spirits. A pillar is solid, material, and strong.
The Holy Spirit is not material but communicates strength to the beings that it inhabits.
Pillars are used as an analogy for people of strong faith who hold the church together by their maturity and courage.
To become a pillar in the temple of God (the promise of Revelation 3:12) requires two things. You need a person and you
need to fill them with strength of character. The pillars of wisdom are the spiritual and conceptual thing that is
added to a human to make them a pillar. Thus when we speak of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom we can either speak of people
who have been made into such pillars or the teachings that accomplished that transformation. Since there are millions
of potential pillar people but only seven categories of quality that each needs, the most sensible thing is to say that
the pillars are those spiritual qualities that the Holy Spirit communicates. But what are those qualities? How are they 
defined and how do they relate to each other? By what authority and cohesive integrity do these pillars accomplish 
this feat? Only the Word of God has the clarity and force to accomplish this task. Thus the Seven Pillars of Wisdom
must be some subset of the Bible that when applied by the Holy Spirit to the soul of the believer inculcates those
qualities.

My research argues that those seven pillars of wisdom are the seven Bible books Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Song of Songs, 
Ecclesiastes, Matthew and Revelation. It also concludes that each pillar book must be illuminated so that the 
believer can understand it, act upon it and be transformed by it. That illumination is the work of the Seven Spirits of God.
Each spirit (really just distinct activities of the one Holy Spirit) illuminates one pillar. It is like a 
lamp mounted on the pillar to light the path to understanding. This analogy is not of my own invention:

#### From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings
#### and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning 
#### **seven torches of fire**, which are **the seven spirits of God**...
###### - Revelation 4:5

The beauty of these torches is that they concisely describe a goal that each of these Bible books was crafted 
to accomplish for us. The fact that they provide such clarity is evidence that the selection of books
is correct and they are ordered in a meaningful way. I derived my ordered list of the seven pillar books before 
concluding that each matched a spirit of God. My principal reason for the order was different - it made the pillar books 
conform to the Harvest Pattern of Jesus. The fact that these two ways of looking at the books produced the same 
order cannot be a coincidence.
