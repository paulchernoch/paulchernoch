#### 1 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples 
#### by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. 
#### 2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of 
#### Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of 
#### his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter said to them, 
##### “I am going fishing.” 
#### They said to him, 
##### “We will go with you.” 
#### They went out and got into the boat, but that night 
#### they caught nothing.
#### 4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; 
#### yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 
#### 5 Jesus said to them, 
##### “Children, do you have any fish?” 
#### They answered him, 
##### “No.” 
#### 6 He said to them, 
##### “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, 
##### and you will find some.” 
#### So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, 
#### because of the quantity of fish. 7 That disciple whom 
#### Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, 
##### “It is the Lord!” 
#### When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, 
#### he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, 
#### and threw himself into the sea. 8 The other disciples came 
#### in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were 
#### not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.
#### 9 When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, 
#### with fish laid out on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, 
##### “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” 
#### 11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, 
#### full of large fish, **153 of them**. And although there 
#### were so many, **the net was not torn**. 12 Jesus said to them, 
##### “Come and have breakfast.” 
#### Now none of the disciples dared ask him, 
##### “Who are you?” 
#### They knew it was the Lord. 
#### 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, 
#### and so with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that 
#### Jesus was revealed to the disciples after 
#### he was raised from the dead.
