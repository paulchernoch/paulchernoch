## The Fifth Trumpet of Revelation 9 

The story of the angel blowing the Fifth Trumpet appears in Revelation 9. It is the first of the three woes.
That sets it apart from the previous trumpets. Chapter 8 devoted a mere seven verses in total to those first four trumpet blasts.
The fifth trumpet is apportioned eleven verses. That makes it five times worse than its predecessors.

<p><em>8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, “Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”</em></p>

<p><em>9:1 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit. 2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. 3 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. 5 They were allowed to torment them for <strong>five months</strong>, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone. 6 And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them.</em></p>

<p><em>7 In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, 8 their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; 9 they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. 10 They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people for <strong>five months</strong> is in their tails. 11 They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.</em></p>

<p><em>- Revelation 8:13-9:11</em></p>

The article [153 and the Fifth Trumpet](./153-and-the-fifth-trumpet.html) analyzes the passage and comes to these conclusions:

  - The fifth trumpet was blown in 1765. The historical event was James Watt's invention of the reciprocating steam engine, which began the Industrial Revolution.
  - The time period is given as **five months** in 9:5,10. This matches the length of a previous judgment: the Flood of Noah lasted from the 17th day of the 2nd month to the 17th day of the 7th month. The most common length of five months is 153 days. Using a day for a year, that means that the plague of the Fifth Trumpet was to last 153 years, hence ended in 1918 AD at the close of the First World War.
  - The image of a **great furnace** in 9:2 matches the blast furnaces used in the Industrial Revolution.
  - The image of smoke in 9:2-3 matches the widespread air pollution caused by the burning of coal.
  - The locusts are kingdoms bent on pillage. The Old Testament often referred to invading armies as locusts.
  - The locusts had women's hair, so these pillaging kingdoms were ruled by queens.
  - The scorpions had breastplates of iron. Iron symbolizes Rome, so their kingdoms were ones that split off from the territory of ancient Rome.
  - The locusts were told not hurt those with the seal of God on their foreheads. Thus these queens ruled over Christian nations.
  - Since their teeth were lion's teeth, at least one of them ruled a kingdom symbolized by a lion. Great Britain's Queen Victoria ruled the greatest of the Christian empires, so she was their leader, the lioness. The remaining queens included several female Tsars of Russia (like Catherine the Great), and Maria Theresa of Austria-Hungary. (The sum of the lengths of their reigns totals about 152 years, which is also about five months long.)
  - By the end of this period, these locusts developed wings: airplanes whose spinning propellers sound like "the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle".
  - The sting of a scorpion is poison. The horrifying weapon that defined the First World War was the use of phosgene, mustard and chlorine gas to maim and kill. Many who breathed in those vile vapors lived on for years with painful and debilitating respiratory conditions, nerve damage and PTSD from the shell shock. The victims truly sought death but could not find it. 
  - The period ended in 1918 at the close of World War I. That war shattered Russia and Austro-Hungary, ending their empires. England was damaged and would lose its colonies after World War II.

The above list includes a few new connections I only noticed today. I doubt that I am the only one to posit a connection to World War I,
but some of the observations above are original, especially the interpretation of five months as 153 years and choosing the start date as 1765 AD.
The implications are frightful. God allowed a star fallen form heaven, either Satan or one of his demons, to direct Christians to wage war 
against non-believers and create a vast and powerful colonial system. The impact of this was to make third world peoples hate Christianity
for all the atrocities committed by those ostensibly Christian rulers.

Habakkuk and other Jewish prophets were horrified that God used nations more wicked than Israel (like Babylon and Persia) to execute
judgment against her. We should be equally horrified that God allowed the reverse: Christian nations serving the interests of Satan.
His plan is incomprehensible. However, if God wants to judge part of the world, what better way than to alienate it from the only
source of salvation?

## The Industrial Revolution in Prophecy

However, the baffling plans of God revealed in Revelation 9 are not the only events of this era prophesied in Scripture.
What else was God up to in the years 1765-1918 AD?

Between *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, I have uncovered over forty spiritual clocks.
Many of them include one or two time periods that overlap the Industrial Revolution. Here is a sampling.
