## Who is Lady Wisdom?

Like a real person, Lady Wisdom is someone you do not get to know all at once. 
Do you have a favorite writer? Perhaps after reading many of her books, 
you become fascinated with who she is as a person. You read news articles, 
a biographical sketch, and interviews with the author. If she is living, perhaps
you attend a book signing and listen in on a panel discussion at a convention.
Then you become bolder and write letters, which turns into a fulfilling correspondence.
Or if she is dead, you visit her house, which is now a museum, on a pilgrimage.

My acquaintance with Lady Wisdom started with reading her words in the Bible, especially Proverbs.
The first six months of 1988 I read from that book every day, before moving on to her other works.

I think Lady Wisdom has at least two homes you can visit, her main residence and a winter cottage. 
The winter cottage is the House of Mourning. I was her frequent guest there for decades.
I got to know the fixtures and furnishings while studying and writing about Job,
one of her frequent guests.

More recently, I have been touring her main residence and making architectural sketches.
However, I still do not know who Lady Wisdom is. She is shy; she didn't say much about herself
because she is so selfless. Here is what we have to go on. First is her speech in Proverbs 1:

#### <sup>20</sup> Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,
##### she raises her voice in the public square;
#### <sup>21</sup> on top of the wall[d] she cries out,
##### at the city gate she makes her speech:

#### <sup>22</sup> “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?
##### How long will mockers delight in mockery
##### and fools hate knowledge?
#### <sup>23</sup> Repent at my rebuke!
##### Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,
##### I will make known to you my teachings.
#### <sup>24</sup> But since you refuse to listen when I call
##### and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
#### <sup>25</sup> since you disregard all my advice
##### and do not accept my rebuke,
#### <sup>26</sup> I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
##### I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
#### <sup>27</sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
##### when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
##### when distress and trouble overwhelm you.

#### <sup>28</sup> “Then they will call to me but I will not answer;
##### they will look for me but will not find me,
#### <sup>29</sup> since they hated knowledge
##### and did not choose to fear the Lord.
#### <sup>30</sup> Since they would not accept my advice
##### and spurned my rebuke,
#### <sup>31</sup> they will eat the fruit of their ways
##### and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
#### <sup>32</sup> For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
##### and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
#### <sup>33</sup> but whoever listens to me will live in safety
##### and be at ease, without fear of harm.”
