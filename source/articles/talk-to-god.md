title: Job and the Ways to Talk to God
quote: on the left hand when he is working, <br/> I do not behold him; <br/> he turns to the right hand, <br/> but I do not see him. - Job 23:9

When Job's life collapsed into ruin, he wanted only one thing. He wanted to talk to God.

The life of faith can appear complicated. There are many doctrines and rules to master.
However, when calamity strikes, it gets very simple. 

**Where are you, God?**

When people are trying to get ahold of me, they have options:

  - cell phone
  - house phone
  - text message
  - MS Teams chat message
  - email
  - ring the doorbell
  - post a letter
  - talk straight to my face

God has arranged many means for us to speak to him, and another set for him to speak to us.
God has also told us ways that we should NOT use, which we call occult practices.
Every Christian should employ all the channels available to them. In a crisis, such habits
will come in handy.

When I studied the Book of Job in detail, I made a wonderful discovery. I found almost every permissible 
means of communicating with God (and vice versa) hidden within its pages. This makes speaking
with God to be one of the key themes of the book. The Book of Job is the Bible's 911 call center.

This article will divide the means of communication into three categories:

  - Those available to mankind before Jesus was born
  - Those available to mankind while Jesus walked on earth
  - Those special means given to the church at Pentecost

To those who wrestle with the whether God has been fair in his dealings over the centuries, this
selection will prove God's love. Most of the means of communication available to Christians today
were also available to the people of the ancient world.

This article is not deep. It is an invitation to do the following:

  - Employ the "boring", ordinary means of communication that are always open to you
  - Pray to God that he might speak to you in special ways
  - Trust that in His time, He will make Himself known in marvelous ways of His choosing

There are many other writers who are more skilled at the contemplative life than I.
I encourage you to track them down to learn the depths of communion with God that are possible.
My humble contribution is my personal experience with interpreting [Dreams](./dreams.html) from God.
Other articles on this website will also touch on the benefits I have received from scripture memorization.

As I contemplated beginning this article this evening, I was exhausted from a long day of work,
still recovering from a week with a respiratory illness and caring for my wife, who just
endured major surgery. I had to drive one daughter home from college, then pick up another daughter 
from her work to take her to the mall to shop. As we drove into the parking lot, the setting sun
pierced the clouds and scattered through a light rain to form a glorious rainbow. When you long 
to hear from God, He is ever eager to talk.

## Ways to Speak with God found in Job

My first list of ways to communicate with God appeared in *Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*.
I scoured Job and thought I found all of them. Oops! I missed one. While getting ready for this article,
I found another way in Job, one that Einstein would not approve of! It seems that God does play dice with the universe...
