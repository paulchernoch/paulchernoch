title: Job and the Ways to Talk to God
quote: on the left hand when he is working, <br/> I do not behold him; <br/> he turns to the right hand, <br/> but I do not see him. - Job 23:9

When Job's life collapsed into ruin, he wanted only one thing. He wanted to talk to God.

The life of faith can appear complicated. There are many doctrines and rules to master.
However, when calamity strikes, it gets very simple. 

**Where are you, God?**

When people are trying to get a hold of me, they have options:

  - cell phone
  - house phone
  - text message
  - MS Teams chat message
  - email
  - ring the doorbell
  - post a letter
  - talk straight to my face

God has arranged many means for us to speak to him, and another set for him to speak to us.
God has also told us ways that we should NOT use, which we call occult practices.
Every Christian should employ all the channels available to them. In a crisis, such habits
will come in handy.

When I studied the Book of Job in detail, I made a wonderful discovery. I found almost every permissible 
means of communicating with God (and vice versa) hidden within its pages. This makes speaking
with God to be one of the key themes of the book. The Book of Job is the Bible's 911 call center.

This article will divide the means of communication into three categories:

  - Those available to mankind before Jesus was born
  - Those available to mankind while Jesus walked on earth
  - Those special means given to the church at Pentecost

To those who wrestle with whether God has been fair in his dealings over the centuries, this
selection will prove God's love. Most of the means of communication available to Christians today
were also available to the people of the ancient world.

This article is not deep. It is an invitation to do the following:

  - Employ the "boring", ordinary means of communication that are always open to you
  - Pray to God that he might speak to you in special ways
  - Trust that in His time, He will make Himself known in marvelous ways of His choosing

There are many other writers who are more skilled at the contemplative life than I.
I encourage you to track them down to learn the depths of communion with God that are possible.
My humble contribution is my personal experience with interpreting [Dreams](./dreams.html) from God.
Other articles on this website will also touch on the benefits I have received from scripture memorization.

As I contemplated beginning this article this evening, I was exhausted from a long day of work,
still recovering from a week with a respiratory illness and caring for my wife, who just
endured major surgery. I had to drive one daughter home from college, then pick up another daughter 
from her work to take her to the mall to shop. As we drove into the parking lot, the setting sun
pierced the clouds and scattered through a light rain to form a glorious rainbow. When you long 
to hear from God, He is ever eager to talk.

## Ways to Speak with God found in Job

My first list of ways to communicate with God appeared in *Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*.
I repeated this list in the chapter "Two Time Paradoxes, Illustrated" in *Peace, Like Solomon Never Knew*.
I scoured Job and thought I found all of them. Oops! I missed one. While getting ready for this article,
I found another way in Job, one that Einstein would not approve of! It seems that God does play dice with the universe...

Here is my expanded list. It is not just a list, it is a powerful demonstration of God's love for Job.
God can utilize many means to speak to humans. How many did God use to speak to Job?

Almost all of them! That is the magnitude of God's love.

And how many means did Job employ to speak to God? Every one that he knew.
That is the magnitude of Job's love for God. In his story, Job:

  - observed God’s attributes through Nature (like rainbows!),
  - trusted the sayings of Wise elders,
  - cast lots (or didn't - this new addition needs explanation!)
  - Prayed,
  - Fasted,
  - offered Sacrifices,  
  - received warnings from Dreams,
  - learned from his Suffering,
  - observed a Sabbath,
  - listened to the Prophets,
  - marveled at God’s Miracles,
  - benefited from the intercession of Angels,
  - had a Theophany (audible words direct from God),
  - prayed that his story be written down. 
  
This last was Job's greatest prayer. 

#### “Oh that my words were written!
##### Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
#### Oh that with an iron pen and lead
##### they were engraved in the rock forever!
#### For I know that my Redeemer lives,
##### and at the last he will stand upon the earth.
#### And after my skin has been thus destroyed,
##### yet in my flesh I shall see God,
#### whom I shall see for myself,
##### and my eyes shall behold, and not another.
#### My heart faints within me!
###### - Job 19:23-27

It is believed that Job was the first book of the Bible to be written down.
Job's prayer that his story be written down therefore created the Bible! 
Thanks to him, we have another means to hear from God; we have his written word.

Reflect on this list. Some (like prayer and reading the Word) are within your power to pursue, 
while others (like miracles, angelic visits and theophany) constitute God’s unique response. 
As Job’s example teaches, one who prizes and employs the first may from time to time be blessed
with the second.
