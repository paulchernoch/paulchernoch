The title of the article is a question with no answer. However, it has no answer for a very good reason.
Decades ago I argued with someone about whether some issue related to Christianity was important or not.
I said it was; he said it wasn't. After thinking about the matter some more, I realized we both were right
and both wrong. It all hinges on this: 

## What makes a question important? 

What makes a question important (we were debating about evangelism) is whether knowing the answer to that question
will bring the hearer closer to God. Will it remove an obstacle to faith? Will it destroy a stronghold of the enemy?
Will if glorify God and draw us into worship and deeper fellowship? 

That means that the importance of a question (and the corresponding answer) depends on the hearer.
It depends on their spiritual condition. It depends on their history. It depends on God's plan for their life.
God loves us all specifically, not generally. As He directs His energies to save each one of us, He takes
our personality and family background into consideration. He tailors His approach to us. That is why
there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question of questions. 

That leaves us with meta-questions. What are the questions, that if we answer them for ourselves, lead us to 
the important questions that we must consider in our own lives? For that list of questions, I have a
promising set to offer. I proposed this list in the chapter "Twelve Timely Questions" in 
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
