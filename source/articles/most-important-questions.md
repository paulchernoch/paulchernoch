title: What are Life's Twelve Most Important Questions?
quote: Then [Jesus] said to them, <br/> “But who do you say that I am?” <br/> - Luke 9:20a
---
The title of this article is a question with no answer. However, it has no answer for a very good reason.
Decades ago I argued with someone about whether some issue related to Christianity was important or not.
I said it was; he said it wasn't. After thinking about the matter some more, I realized we both were right
and both wrong. It all hinges on this: 

## What makes a Question important? 

What makes a question important (we were debating about evangelism) is whether knowing the answer to that question
will bring the hearer closer to God. Will it remove an obstacle to faith? Will it destroy a stronghold of the enemy?
Will if glorify God and draw us into worship and deeper fellowship?

That means that the importance of a question (and the corresponding answer) depends on the hearer.
It depends on their spiritual condition. It depends on their history. It depends on God's plan for their life.
God loves us all specifically, not generally. As He directs His energies to save each one of us, He takes
our personality and family background into consideration. He tailors His approach to us. That is why
there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question of questions. 

That leaves us with meta-questions. What are the questions, that if we answer them for ourselves, lead us to 
the important questions that we must consider in our own lives? For that list of questions, I have a
promising set to offer. I proposed this list in the chapter "Twelve Timely Questions" in 
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*. 

For these meta-questions, I discovered something marvelous. They are self-authenticating. 
How are they self-authenticating? When you find the answer to one of them, it changes you.
It opens your eyes and makes the world clearer. It sets you free from some form of bondage.

Do you see the problem? Only once you find the answer can you be sure that you were asking
a good and important question. There is a remedy for this problem. Sometimes God buries a 
question in your heart that will not go away. It shouts confusion and longing into your
soul year after year. It must be investigated or your heart will never find peace.

This speaks a simple truth. God guides us not by answers, but by questions. Have you heard this adage?

#### Give a man a fish and he eats for a day. 
#### Teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime.

The Bible does answer many questions, feeding us for a day. It also poses deep questions.
Those carry us forward, deepen our curiosity, hone our logical skills and teach us humility.
This is how the Lord began to teach me this lesson.

I read Dietrich Bonhoeffer's *The Cost of Discipleship* and tried to live by it. I failed.
Much of his teaching centered on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. When I realized that I 
did not know how to follow Jesus' teachings in that sermon, I memorized it. That took months.
Out of that activity I gained new insight into the Golden Rule. (We will later see that the 
Golden Rule is part of the answer to one of the twelve questions.) I was so amazed by 
what I learned that I knew I had discovered something deep. I was convinced that this new
insight was so powerful that the rest of my days I would live at peace, able to love my neighbors
and produce good works in this world. Surely all my confusion and anxiety would evaporate.

I was wrong. The Golden Rule really is very powerful, but it only answers one question, and there
are more. For a time I drifted, confused. I did not know what I did not know.
I did not recognize my disability. I needed another question! The Lord generously provided one,
and it flowed from that same sermon that I had memorized. That next question was, 
"What are the spiritual treasures that we are supposed to store up in heaven?"
Jesus told us to pursue heavenly treasures, but he didn't give us a list!

That question would nag at me for a decade. I had young children and was busy fighting to hold
a job during a turbulent time in the software industry, so I made no efforts to research it.
When I came up for air, it was 2004. I spent the next decade pursuing an answer.
The outcome was two novels that explored that theme plus my first nonfiction, 
*The Endless Hunt: Or if I've Found God, Why am I still Looking?*

As I searched for hidden treasure, new questions popped up that would lead to more books.
Some of those questions were:

  - How can I cultivate a desire to see God's Glory that is as strong as that of Moses?
  - How can I find resilience to overcome suffering?
  - How can I find the path to peace?

As I explored those questions, I found answers for other questions that I hadn't asked. 
As the answers started piling up, I was able to step back and consider what those questions might be.
In Doug Adams' parody of science fiction and philosophy, *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, 
he made fun of using AI to solve existential questions. The philosophers program a vast computer
and ask it to tell them the answer to the question of life, the universe and everything. 
The computer dutifully chugs away for thousands of years before spitting out the answer:

**42**

The sheepish philosophers realized their error. The answer was meaningless without the question!
So they built a bigger computer to find the question. That would take millions of years to run.

We don't have millions of years, so here are the questions I found.

The following is exactly as found in the chapter "Twelve Timely Questions" in 
*Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*, apart from a few added notes. 
Please pardon me if there is a little repetition with what came before.
Before that, in case I did not make myself clear and you are left wondering why an
article about questions is in a section on spiritual growth:

**Part of Growing Spiritually is Learning to Ask Better Questions!!!**

## Twelve Timely Questions

Something is missing. As a teenager, this thought kept
popping into my head. Something is missing. I knew it
was important to figure out, but I didn’t know what I
was missing! I confess, I didn’t do much to find out what it
was I was missing. My life was like a nearly empty Sudoku
puzzle. Without numbers in enough of the squares, you
can’t find the solution.

Something is missing... Actually, a lot of things were
missing, but if Someone would have given me one clue, I
could have found those missing pieces to my life. What clue
is that?

I didn’t even know the questions!
If I at least had the questions, I could start looking, and as
I solved each riddle I would know how close I was to my
goal. These days you could ask your phone, “Hey, Siri, what
are life’s most important questions?” Then you could ask
Alexa, Google, Wikipedia and other “experts” and compare
answers. Would you trust them? Would you plan how to
live your life based on an A.I.?

Good news! I found the list of questions and can save you
the trouble!

Wait, I see a problem. My list of questions might be so
detailed that they only apply to me, or so general that they
are a useless guide to you. Ah, but the way I found them
might be helpful...

This is the way I once believed life ought to work. When
you are young, your heart seizes a grand goal and you think
long and hard about what it will take to get there. That
passion is the wellspring for all the important questions
you will need, and you set about getting answers and acting
on what you learn. Once the final question is answered, you
have achieved your goal and found true happiness. You
might be able to plan out your life that way. I read a
biography about a man who did exactly as I described. It
worked for him.

For that life to work, it is really, really important that you
get a handle on those questions early on, or you will never
get very far. When did I figure them out? While I was
researching this book! People my age are near retirement.
My younger sister “Captain Kate” already retired. By my
original way of judging things, my life has been a failure. I
don’t have enough years left in me to do much with those
questions now that I have them.

Should I be disappointed? I am not. This is another
paradox. Life is like the *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. 
You get the answers first, then must set off to figure which
questions each answers. Sound confusing? This is a good
thing!

What does an answer look like? I have described several.
Joy. Acceptance. Fearlessness. Purpose. Peace. Answers are
powerful, self-authenticating, and directional. They point
to God. Once you learn one of these answers, the
appropriate questions pop out of hiding. You know the
question is important because its answer transformed you.
This is the way Jesus worked. Instead of the crowd getting
to ask Jesus direct questions like, “Are you the messiah?”,
he turned it around. He performed the miracles of a
messiah, then asked them, “Who do you say that I am?”
God’s miraculous power changes us, then the questions
pop into our heads to crystallize our understanding and
guide us farther.

In becoming a Christian, I discovered my first question,
but didn’t know I had. That question is: *when I am in
trouble, who can help me?* The answer is Jesus. Now that I
have all the questions gathered and organized, it is not first
on my list, though maybe it should be. Among the troubles
Jesus helps us overcome is being lost. He helps us find
those questions because we need their answers to thrive.
My search for life’s most important questions took on
urgency when I turned thirty. After hearing hundreds of
sermons, reading scores of religious books, and praying for
wisdom, I was confused. So many ideas! So many rules! So
many doctrines and arguments! It was too complicated to
follow. Trying to live up to what I expected I ought to be
doing was exhausting. I needed something simpler. I
started researching so I could write a book on the subject,
but didn’t get far.

Then I got married. Knowing that I would soon have
children, I felt the urgency double. I needed to know so I
could raise my kids right. I tried thinking things through for
a few months, but the busyness of life combined with not
knowing where to begin. I gave up again.

A few years later, I had three young children, with one in
the hospital. Out of work, sitting by Danielle’s bedside
every night, I decided this might be the last long stretch of
free time I would see for many years. I began to outline my
first novel. In the course of writing it, I asked, “What are the
ten most important spiritual treasures?” After all, Jesus said
we were supposed to lay up for ourselves treasures in
heaven. What are they? I decided that the hero of my story
had failed to value and protect these treasures, suffered for
it, and needed to change to save himself and his family.
Searching my heart and scripture, my list filled up with
things I have already described, like love, joy, and
goodness, plus others.

I didn’t know it, but I had just discovered another worthy
question. After the novel was done, I wrote *The Endless
Hunt*. I expanded on those ten spiritual treasures and in the
process found two more.

Later I realized those two extra treasures were not like
the others. One was the fear of the Lord. The other was the
glory of God. Only in preparing this book did I realize that
those two treasures are the answers to two more big
questions: Where do I begin? and What is my goal?

Now that I knew where to begin, what to collect along my
journey, and what was my goal, that left the middle. How
can I change? Life is filled with trials and we must change to
meet them. After enduring over a decade of such trials,
shortly after my mother died, a thought entered my head.
How can I make my life more resilient in the face of life’s
challenges? To pursue that I studied Job and wrote 
*Job Rises: Thirteen Keys to a Resilient Life*. Only after writing 
that book was I able to simplify what I had learned into a five-step
process for spiritual growth. That includes the process for
change, the obstacles (and how to become resilient enough
to handle them), and where to turn for help (that first
question again).

This book will expound on that five-step process for
producing a spiritual harvest (expanded later into seven
steps). However, Ecclesiastes brought me face to face with
the hardest question of all. The Psalmist asked it often:
**When?** I am still looking for that answer.

When I was younger, I struggled with three other
questions. They were very important to me at the time, but
when Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
these things will be added unto you,” he meant it! Unlike the
important questions, these secondary questions were not
hard to find; they were hard to push aside. If you do not
push them aside until you find God and begin to grow in
His ways, you may never find the right path. They are: 
*"What should I do for work? Whom should I marry? Where should I live?"*

Let’s collect all these questions together:

### Primary Questions

  - Where do I begin?
  - Who am I?
  - What’s my Goal?
  - What’s Valuable to acquire along the way?
  - How can I change?
  - What’re the Obstacles to change?
  - How can I become resilient and overcome them?
  - Who or what can help me?
  - When will I succeed?

### Secondary questions:

  - Where should I live?
  - What should I do for work?
  - Whom should I marry?
  
Are you surprised? Disappointed? The questions are not
surprising, revolutionary, or specific to Christianity. For
someone immersed for thirty-five years of his life in
Christianity, its ideas, ideals and peculiarities, I am
surprised. I expected after such a lengthy investigation to
come up with a list exhibiting profound theological insight.
Anyone with skill at planning, organizing, and executing a
path to a treasured goal has probably internalized these
questions since birth.

I am not such a person! In “Executive Function
Challenges in Children with Asperger Profiles”, Bonnie
Glickman, M.Ed., NCC describes one challenge faced by
children on the Autism Spectrum (in which I fall), called
EFD or Executive Function Disorder. 

*“Executive function is the ability to plan, organize and manage
complex tasks. Executive function allows us to develop and apply
problem-solving skills as circumstances call for them. We need
executive function skills to deal with the stream of decision points we
encounter throughout every day.”*

People with EFD are confused, disorganized, and poor at
planning and executing tasks. One of the many deficiencies
they have is “Lack of a systematic approach to keeping order
in their daily lives.”

What does this mean? A man with an innate physiological
limitation, after decades of prayer, study, struggle, and
reflection, rediscovered what most ordinary people take for
granted. Is he now trying to persuade you that he
discovered something new? Yes! My favorite poem by Emily
Dickinson comes closest to capturing it:

#### Success is counted sweetest
#### By those who ne'er succeed.
#### To comprehend a nectar
#### Requires sorest need.

#### Not one of all the purple Host
#### Who took the Flag today
#### Can tell the definition
#### So clear of victory

#### As he defeated – dying –
#### On whose forbidden ear
#### The distant strains of triumph
#### Burst agonized and clear!

Who prized the gift of sight more, the crowd of
onlookers, or the blind man Jesus healed? Who jumped the
highest, the ones strolling through the temple or the lame
man Peter healed in Jesus’ name?

In the summer of 1989, I received a call to missionary
service. I thought it was for a lifetime, but it turned out that
it was only for two short term trips to Romania. During that
brief period, the Lord lifted me up. I found language texts
and a Romanian immigrant to teach me the language. I got
a passport, gathered supplies, wrote letters to missionary
agencies, prayed, and read hundreds of articles on Eastern
Europe and Romanian history. Every smallest detail of life
was suddenly infused with urgency, purpose, and
excitement. I felt as though I were being pulled into the
future. I went with a Christian choir on my first trip and we
sang in about twenty-two different cities.

The trip stretched me and I grew in confidence. After I
returned, I wrote my first Christian song. Creative parts of
me that had withered during the depression of my college
years began to heal. However, the total commitment to a
mission, the ease and delight of planning and executing on
a worthy goal evaporated and I was back to my normal self.
However, there was a difference. God had shown me what
it was like to live a life of purpose. There was no turning
back. I had to find that way again. I had heard a voice like
Isaiah saying:

#### Whether you turn to the right or to the left, 
#### your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, 
##### “This is the way; walk in it.”
###### - Isaiah 30:21, NIV

The decades since then I have labored to rediscover in
large what God privileged me to glimpse. Let’s look at those
questions again. Pretend you are blind and lame like I was,
and be amazed.

### Where do I begin?

This question is easy to ask and easy to answer, but its
answer is not easy to understand. The road to peace begins
with the fear of the Lord. The preeminence of the fear of the
Lord is the starting premise in Proverbs, the heart of Job,
the pervasive theme of thirty-one Psalms, and the
conclusion of Ecclesiastes. The fear of the Lord is extolled
or commanded in the Books of Moses, Joshua, Samuel,
Isaiah and almost every other prophet, in the Gospels, the
letters of Paul and Peter, and in Revelation.

People already living in fear want comfort and
protection, not more fear. The arrogant want the power to
make others fear them. The philosophical look down on
fear as a scornful source of motivation. The hedonists want
only pleasure. And proud freedom-seekers of all stripes
want to be in charge of their own destiny and fear no one.
This is a great paradox that God has laid before us. What
we want least – to be afraid – God has made the avenue by
which most of His blessings enter our life. Here is a
selection of the benefits that accrue to those who fear the
Lord:

  - wisdom & knowledge
  - love, joy & peace
  - prosperity, provision & riches
  - protection, security & deliverance
  - salvation
  - long life
  - freedom
  - courage & strength
  - eternal purity
  - sincere and true praise & worship
  - generosity & happiness & contentment
  - compassion & justice
  - honor
  - humble authority
  - righteous children & a prosperous, blessed family
  - repentance & obedience
  - God's remembrance and compassion
  
Ecclesiastes concludes with these words:

#### Now all has been heard;
##### here is the conclusion of the matter:
#### Fear God and keep his commandments,
##### for this is the duty of all mankind.
#### For God will bring every deed into judgment,
##### including every hidden thing,
###### whether it is good or evil. 
###### - Ecclesiastes 12:13-14, NIV

Here is the problem with Ecclesiastes. Onto a compelling
argument the author grafts an incongruous conclusion.
Bridging this chasm took me decades. Each time I revisited
the book, I took one more step. Ultimately, I accepted that
such confusion says more about the state of the reader’s
heart than the logic of the book.

**The first milestone is rejection**. What good is following
more rules? Isn’t it legalistic? You crave freedom. Like me,
you probably consider yourself moral, don’t steal or kill or
go out of your way to cause trouble, so it is not an anarchy
thing. It is just that Ecclesiastes demolishes the case for
following the rules, but what does it replace that with?
Nothing! That long list given above of the benefits that
accrue to those who fear the Lord is scarcely alluded to,
and only then to show counter-examples. The case that
fearing the Lord bestows benefits is made in Psalms,
Proverbs and elsewhere, but not in the book that frames
the thesis. Why?

**The second milestone is confused acceptance**. You
have begun to cultivate fear and reverence toward God and
it has caused positive changes. You agree that obeying God
conscientiously is a good idea and are trying hard to do
that, but the conclusion of the book still does not follow
logically from the argument. What kind of apologetics is
that? Fear seems an empty goal to set for your life. It is not
something to get excited about.

**The third milestone is submission**. You labor to
discard your old sources of meaning and purpose. As it says
in Proverbs 2:1-10, understanding the fear of the Lord takes
patience and a dedicated, seeking heart, but eventually:

#### ... wisdom will enter your heart, 
##### and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.”
###### - Proverbs 2:10

You accept the possibility that
it will prove more fulfilling than initially thought. The logic
of the book is becoming clearer. There is a reason for the
disconnect between the steps of the argument and the
conclusion. Human logic relies on reasoning about things
we can see “under the sun”. God’s wisdom relies on
reasoning about things invisible, things that can only be
seen “under heaven”. An empirical proof of the conclusion
is therefore impossible. That the fear of the Lord is the
purpose of life must be accepted on faith.

**The fourth milestone is transcendence**. You discover
that the fear of the Lord is **not** the purpose of life! Instead, it
is the door you must walk through to discover the true
purpose of your life. The fear of the Lord is the general
purpose for all mankind, but alongside that we each have a
specific purpose. Truly, the fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom, not its end.

(Note: Since writing that chapter, I wrote another book and 
reached a **fifth milestone** in my understanding of the end of Ecclesiastes.
You cannot understand Solomon's conclusion unless you grasp both
the fear of the Lord and the Commandments. There is a glory in the
Ten Commandments that I had not yet seen when I originally wrote this essay.
I rectified that in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. Those commandments
are not static scalars, defining right and wrong and judging our actions.
The commandments are vectors. They have a direction and they point
us along the path to peace.)

### Who am I?

It is tempting to put this question at the head of the list.
When I was a kid, the older generation made fun of young
people dropping out of college and hitting the road. They
said, “I need to find myself first.” Acquiring self awareness
is useful when it comes to plotting your path through life. It
is the first milestone on the self-directed life.

For someone aspiring to lead a God-directed life, it must
not come first. As it is written: But who can discern their own
errors? Forgive my hidden faults. (Psalm 19:12, NIV) Acquiring
knowledge of God must come first. Then, in the light of
God’s truth, a disciple will see who they really are. Vices
and virtues will become clear. The fear of the Lord will not
only reveal the weakness and sinfulness within, it will begin
the process of transforming you into a righteous, sanctified
person.

The unregenerate person cannot stand to see who they
are, and so must avoid looking too intently at certain areas
of their character. They must construct a false facade to
hide the shame. They must periodically reinvent themselves
like a pop star.

The Christian, through prayer, repentance, and the
assurance of God’s forgiveness, is emboldened to search
deeper. The question “Who am I?” once haunted me. No
more. Why? Because I have replaced it with a better
question:

**Who am I becoming?**

### What’s my goal?

We skip from the start of the journey straight to the end.
While writing *The Endless Hunt*, this was the greatest
surprise. The twelfth treasure was the Glory of God. That is
the goal of life. The difference is that we shall each glorify
God in different ways. The first question of the Westminster
Shorter Catechism is this:

#### Q. What is the chief end of man?
#### A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, 
##### and to enjoy him forever.

God’s glory and our true delight are inextricably linked.
No less than C.S. Lewis struggled to comprehend how
God’s pursuit of His own glory should be good, unselfish
and the highest good of mankind. In “The Weight of Glory”
Lewis described his journey from discounting the place of
glory in the teachings of the church to celebrating it. The
moment of God’s first bathing of his children in undeserved
glory and approval will be the happiest day in all of time.
Despite reading Lewis’ essay in my twenties, it was not
until I was around fifty that the importance of God’s glory
exploded in my consciousness. It is not something you get
the first time you read it. How did I make this discovery? I
was writing what I thought was the final chapter of The
Endless Hunt. It was dawning on me that treasuring
eternal treasures in our heart is another name for worship.
I noticed a Bible quote in my book that referred to God’s
glory and decided to research it. That led me back to Lewis’
essay. I decided to add glory as my twelfth spiritual
treasure. That was when I reread my own book and saw
that dozens of the Bible verses I had quoted throughout my
book made mention of the glory of God. Glory was right
under my nose, but I didn’t see it!

Your assignment is this. As you read your Bible, note how
often the word glory appears in your favorite verses. How
can such a powerful word hide so well?
After my discovery, did I leave it at that? No. For the next
three years I fasted one day a week with a single prayer,
“Lord, show me your glory.” Can you guess what happened?

Nothing! I don’t recall a single one of those hundred and
fifty plus days of prayer and fasting where I felt extra close
to God, or received a miraculous answer to prayer, or
received new spiritual insight. Not one.

Is that why I stopped fasting? Because it didn’t work? No,
I stopped fasting because it seemed like I had prayed
enough for that. Since I stopped fasting, my thirst for God’s
Word has increased, I wrote my book on Job and began this
one. My understanding of Scripture has grown more in the
last few years than it had in the previous twenty. My
conviction that I knew what I should be doing, sense of
purpose, direction, drive, and focus have increased
markedly. I feel closer to God recently than I had for a long
time. That is why Solomon had to tear down all those other
sources of purpose but could not adequately describe their
substitute. The real thing cannot be described, only
experienced.

### What is valuable to acquire along the way?

I wrote a whole book on this topic so won’t repeat it
here. Setting aside the fear of the Lord and the Glory of
God, these are the other ten treasures:

  - Eternal Life
  - Family
  - Work & Rest
  - Authority & Purpose
  - Love
  - Wisdom, Justice & Truth
  - Courage & Protection
  - Freedom
  - Happiness & Generosity
  - Joy

I grouped them into four rings. Eternal life stood by itself.
The next three formed the ring of relationships. Then came
the ring of nourishment. The outer ring was the ring of
flourishing. At the core, inside life, was the fear of the Lord.
Shining around the whole like the corona of the sun was
glory.

(NOTE: I now would classify these groupings as surrendering (for the fear of the Lord), 
protecting (for life), establishing (for relationships), nourishing, flourishing and 
transcending (for glory).)

The paradox with these eternal treasures is that you
receive them by giving something similar that is perishable
away. You may notice considerable overlap between these
treasures and the seven pieces of peace derived from
Ecclesiastes 3: Existence (eternal life), Function (wisdom,
etc), Emotions (freedom, happiness, joy), Relationships
(family, work, authority, love), Resources (freedom,
happiness & generosity), Communication (love, truth,
generosity & glory), and Loyalty (courage and protection).
This shows there is a clear link between our spiritual values
and our happiness. Treasuring the things that God
treasures is conducive to a life of peace.

### How can I change?

### What’re the Obstacles to change?

### How can I become resilient and overcome them?

### Who or what can help me?

These four questions come as a package deal. What do
they have in common? They are four facets of spiritual
warfare. Answering the third question, about resilience,
was the focus of my precious book, Job Rises: Thirteen Keys
to a Resilient Life. *Peace* tackled all four in the
chapters titled “Hour of Temptation” and “Four Months
‘Til Harvest”.

The principal finding is that spiritual growth typically
occurs in cycles, and each cycle has five principal stages:

  - Plowing, though suffering
  - Planting the seed of the Word
  - Pouring water, the baptism of the Holy Spirit
  - Plucking weeds and thorns, via the Father’s discipline
  - Producing a harvest

(Note: *Peace* would later add two more stages, **Preparation** at 
the beginning and **Peace** at the end.)

By this construction, our obstacles are the devil, the
world and the flesh, and our allies are the three persons of
the Trinity, working in concert. This leaves only the
question of change. We change if we endure until the
harvest. Which brings us to...

### When will I succeed?

There are times in Scripture when God tells the people
exactly how long a situation will last. To pharaoh: there will
be seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine.
To Israel, wandering in the desert: you will not enter the
promised land until after everyone in this generation dies.
While taking a shower in January 1985, I demanded that
God prove to me that he exists and gave him two weeks to
show himself. Three months plus a week later, I became a
Christian. It is not my experience that God acts on our
timetable. We are not God. We are not in charge. Some
harvests require a very long growing season. One of mine
lasted over a decade, as related in the next chapter in *Peace*,
“Hammer Time”.

God usually does not tell me how long I will have to wait.
There are exceptions...

### Where should I live?

### What should I do for work?

God has often guided me in my work, helping me choose
between job offers or to find a new job quickly amid a
recession. During the Great Recession, things were bad. I
went to a book store going out of business and found a half
price book by Joel Osteen. One chapter title spoke to me:
“You are closer than you think.” I believed that on faith.
The next day I had a job offer from General Electric.
I have many stories to tell about work, but the most
memorable happened about four years ago. My mother had
just died and now my dad was in the hospital. He nearly
died of a rare tick-born illness called anaplasmosis. By this
time I had been out of work two-and-a-half months. My
frequent periods of unemployment had wiped out our
savings and my pension, so it was urgent that I find a new
job immediately. I was staying with my dad in upstate New
York and spent every day at the hospital for several weeks
so I could advocate for him.

What happened? My dad lived. Why? My focus was on
caring for him, not myself. I relayed his symptoms to my
wife over the phone and she came up with the idea that it
was a tick-borne illness. With that hint, the doctor knew
what medicine to use and changed his treatment.
I had job interviews over the phone and had to write and
submit code samples to potential employers. How was I
able to withstand the temptation to be anxious and panic,
to concentrate during those phone calls and simultaneously
attend to my father?

That is a question I don’t have to answer. That wasn’t my
job, but God’s. Because I put my father’s needs first and
trusted God to take care of me and my family, He gave me
peace like I had never known before. It lasted for months. A
few days after my father was released from rehab, I landed
a new job. God knew exactly how long my dad would need
my help and that I could not be there for him if I was
employed. He planned everything down to the day. It was a
good plan.

### Whom should I marry?

This question is so all-consuming for young people that
God arranged for the book of Proverbs to end with advice
on how to recognize a good wife.

For years I wore myself out trying to find that wife.
Loneliness, depression, hopelessness, and unbelief in God’s
goodness assailed me. I even got mad at my pastor one
summer and refused his advice. That fall, a woman at
church named Lynette approached me. She said, “I think
God is telling me that you will soon meet someone that you
will be in a relationship with.”

Outwardly, I thanked her, but inwardly I was angry.
Christians can be as good as the rest at telling you what you
want to hear. I considered her words to be false comfort. A
few days later, I repented. I didn’t know if Lynette’s words
were a true prophecy from God or not, but I was sure that
my disbelief was proof that I lacked faith that God could
help me find a wife.

A few weeks after Lynette spoke, I first set eyes on Tina.
Tina and I just celebrated our twenty-sixth wedding
anniversary. She is not just a wife, she is a good wife. Her
love and careful attention to the important things of life
saved my mom’s life once and my dad’s life three times.
(Did I mention that she diagnosed his first heart attack over
the phone and urged me to drive him to the hospital right
away?) She has also diagnosed numerous of our children’s
ailments, some exceedingly rare.

Should you get married, how you find your spouse will
be different. One thing that should not be different: trust
the Lord to help you answer this question. He’s good with
advice.

Without that advice, I would not have made it through
the storms that hit our family, as you shall see...
