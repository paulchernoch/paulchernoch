A cryptogram is a message encoded using a single substitution cipher. Every occurrence of a given letter is replaced with a different letter of the alphabet. On this website, the original message is a short passage of Scripture,
hence a **Scriptoquote**.

Type in your guesses for letters in the space above the coded letters and that guess will be replaced throughout the rest of the puzzle. When you solve the puzzle, the words will change color. To start over and clear all your guesses, click on the "Start Over" button below the puzzle. If you give up, you can click on the "See Answer" button.

The Bible verse changes every day. The answer key is chosen randomly, so if you refresh the web page, the same quote
will be shown, but the code will be different.

In high school, the first thing I did after I got off the school bus in the morning was to run to the school library, 
get the newspaper, and copy the Daily Cryptoquote onto a sheet of paper. The secret message was always a famous 
quote by a historic figure. Then I would be off to Home Room. I usually had the puzzle solved before Home Room ended
a half hour later. Sometimes I had the puzzle cracked in under three minutes. How fast can you solve the puzzle?

My thanks to Tim S. Long, who created the [gryptocram](https://github.com/tlong314/gryptocram) javascript library used to display and interact with the puzzles.
