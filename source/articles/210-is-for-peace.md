title: 210 is for Peace
quote: And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw <br/> his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations. <br/> And Job died, an old man, and full of days. <br/> - Job 42:16-17

Job lived to be **two hundred ten (210)** years old. Extra-biblical sources affirm this, but we can infer it from Scripture. After Job’s trials ended, God gave him twice as much as he lost. Since the Lord extended his life by one hundred forty years, he must have been seventy at the time when God appeared to him. Adding a hundred forty to seventy yields two hundred ten.

How can we factor his age?

**210 = 42 x 5 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7**

Forty-two signifies struggle leading to victory, while five signifies the grace of a harvest. These describe Job’s experience well. The book consists of forty-two chapters and they are divided into five sections: 

  - prologue (chapter 1-2)
  - dialogue with three friends (chapters 3-31)
  - Elihu’s speech (chapters 32-37)
  - God’s speech (chapters 38-41)
  - Epilogue (chapter 42)
  
Broken down further, the two, three and seven stand for the members of the Trinity:

  - Two (2) for the Son
  - Three (3) for the Father
  - Seven (7) for the Holy Spirit

Each played a vital role in transforming Job, as explored in *Job Rises*.

At the end of Job, the book summarizes his life:

#### And Job died, an old man, 
##### and full of days. 
###### - Job 42:17, ESV

That is another way of saying that Job found peace. Two hundred ten stands for peace. You can spin life’s roulette wheel and hope it lands on 210.
Or you can play for the house. 

The house always wins.
