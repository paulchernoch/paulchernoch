title: Celestial Clocks
---
Genesis 1 tells us that on the fourth day, God created the sun, moon and stars to govern day and night and regulate days, seasons and years.
They are God's celestial time pieces. These heavenly bodies move through the skies with mechanical precision, the
attribute par excellence of the Celestial Clock. In Solomon's inventory of types of prophetic clocks, they come second, after the generation clocks:

#### The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
##### and hastens to the place where it rises.
###### - Ecclesiastes 1:5

This article will summarize sections of *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* that were devoted to this type of clock.
It will name each clock, block out the eras of history that it prophesies, point out where in those books it was developed, and (for a few) 
point to an extended treatment in a separate article on this website.

## Creation Clock

  - Bible book: Genesis 1
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1
  - Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD (or later)
  - Intervals: 7
  - Period: 1000 years

**Notable facts:**

Matches the seven days of creation to important events in the
seven millennia of history.

Day 2 of creation is the only one God did not call good. This
millennium had the flood and the Tower of Babel, the worst calamities in history (so far).

Day 3 of creation is when God created the dry ground, and plants and trees which grow from seeds. 
The ground is the Law of Moses and the seed is the beginning of the writing of God's Word.

Day 4 of creation, when God created the sun, moon & stars,
ends within a few years of the birth of the Sun of Righteousness and Morning Star, Jesus.

Day 5 the birds were created, corresponding to the Holy Spirit, given at Pentecost, beginning the 5th millennium.
The sea creatures were also created. Leviathan, the great sea serpent is first given expression in the form of the Roman Empire.

Day 6 saw the creation of the beasts and man. The sixth millennium spans the period during which mankind's knowledge grew fastest.

Day 7 will usher in the sabbath rest, when Christ returns.

## Temple Dedication Clocks

  - Bible book: 1 Kings 8:62–63
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Psalm 119: The Shepherd’s Clock
  - Timespan: 4020 BC–39 AD, 960 BC–1680 AD
  - Intervals: 22
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

When Solomon dedicated the temple, the quantity of
animals sacrificed used the numbers twenty-two (22) and
one hundred twenty (120). If you start the clock at the
creation and allow Adam and Methuselah their longer
generations, the 22nd generation ends in 39 AD, shortly
after Christ sacrificed his life for our sins on the cross.
Combined with the Psalm 119 clock which defines the
birth of Christ before 19 AD, you can derive a range for
the crucifixion of 19–39 AD!

If you instead start the clock from the temple dedication
in 960 BC, the 22nd generation ends in 1680 AD. This
final generation was the beginning of the Scientific
Revolution and the age of Reason. Solomon, the wisest
non-divine man in history, pointed to the era where
humanity’s earthly wisdom would explode.

## Solomon’s Celestial Clock

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Solomon’s Celestial Clock,
  - Solomon’s End Times
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 120 years (per “time”)

**Notable facts:**

This is the most fundamental prophetic clock in the Bible.
It is the scaffolding that allows the others to be fit into a coherent and consistent framework.
That makes it the mainspring of God's prophetic clocks.

By assigning a single word to each generation, Solomon revealed the principal spiritual forces at work from the
dedication of the temple in 960 BC until the day the Lord ushers in eternal peace. His choice of words? Impeccable.
