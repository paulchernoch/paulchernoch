title: Celestial Clocks
---
Genesis 1 tells us that on the fourth day, God created the sun, moon and stars to govern day and night and regulate days, seasons and years.
They are God's celestial time pieces. These heavenly bodies move through the skies 
with mechanical precision, the attribute par excellence of the Celestial Clock. In Solomon's inventory of types of prophetic clocks, they come second, after the generation clocks:

#### The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
##### and hastens to the place where it rises.
###### - Ecclesiastes 1:5

This article will summarize sections of *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* that were devoted to this type of clock.
It will name each clock, block out the eras of history that it prophesies, point out where in those books it was developed, and (for a few) 
point to an extended treatment in a separate article on this website.

## Creation Clock

  - Bible book: Genesis 1
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1
  - Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD (or later)
  - Intervals: 7
  - Period: 1000 years

**Notable facts:**

Matches the seven days of creation to important events in the seven millennia of history.
This assumes that history will last no more than seven thousand years before the final judgment and the
establishment of the new heavens and new earth. This clock is similar to the ancient expectation of many theologians which is 
called [Millennial Day Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennial_Day_Theory). Many Christians combine the idea of the 
millennial reign of Christ with the idea of a thousand year sabbath during the seventh millennium. 
My formulation of eschatology, **Fractal Historicism**, does not. The two events are distinct.
The millennial kingdom of CHrist has already come and gone, having lasted from 380 to 1380 AD in the form of Christian Rome and its extension
through the Byzantine Empire. If the Creation was on or near 4020 BC, then we are already in the early years of the
seventh millennium, yet Christ has not returned. My expectation is that the eternal sabbath will begin during this millennium,
but not immediately. It could start at any time but the present world order may linger for two or three centuries more.

Day 1 of creation (4020-3020 BC) was when God created light and separated the light from the darkness
by alternating day and night. This matches the division of people into two groups, the righteous descendants of Seth
and the corrupt descendants of Cain.

Day 2 of creation (3020-2020 BC) is the only one God did not call good. This
millennium had Noah's flood and the Tower of Babel, the worst calamities in history (so far).

Day 3 of creation (2020-1020 BC) is when God created the dry ground and plants and trees which grow from seeds. 
The ground is the Law of Moses and the seed is the beginning of the writing of God's Word.

Day 4 of creation (1020-20 BC), when God created the sun, moon & stars,
ends within a few years of the birth of the Sun of Righteousness and Morning Star, Jesus.
This millennium was when most of the prophets lived. Prophecy is about revealing God's future plans, interpreting
history and marking out time, just like the heavenly bodies. Solomon lived at the very beginning of this millennium.
His writings provide the temporal framework for understanding the rest of the prophets.

Day 5 of creation (20 BC-980 AD), when the birds were created, corresponds to the Holy Spirit, given at Pentecost, beginning the 5th millennium.
The sea creatures were also created. Leviathan, the great sea serpent is first given expression in the form of the Roman Empire.

Day 6 of creation (980-1980 AD) saw the creation of the beasts and man. The sixth millennium spans the period during which mankind's knowledge grew fastest.

Day 7 of creation (1980 AD-?) will usher in the sabbath rest, when Christ returns.

## Temple Dedication Clocks

  - Bible book: 1 Kings 8:62–63
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Psalm 119: The Shepherd’s Clock
  - Timespan: 4020 BC–39 AD, 960 BC–1680 AD
  - Intervals: 22
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

When Solomon dedicated the temple, the quantity of
animals sacrificed used the numbers twenty-two (22) and
one hundred twenty (120). If you start the clock at the
creation and allow Adam and Methuselah their longer
generations, the 22nd generation ends in 39 AD, shortly
after Christ sacrificed his life for our sins on the cross.
Combined with the Psalm 119 clock which defines the
birth of Christ before 19 AD, you can derive a range for
the crucifixion of 19–39 AD!

If you instead start the clock from the temple dedication
in 960 BC, the 22nd generation ends in 1680 AD. This
final generation was the beginning of the Scientific
Revolution and the age of Reason. Solomon, the wisest
non-divine man in history, pointed to the era where
humanity’s earthly wisdom would explode.

## Solomon’s Celestial Clock

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapters: 
    - Solomon’s Celestial Clock,
    - Solomon’s End Times
    - Solomon’s Sundial
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 120 years (per “time”)

**Notable facts:**

This is the most fundamental prophetic clock in the Bible.
It is the scaffolding that allows the others to be fit into a coherent and consistent framework.
That makes it the mainspring of God's prophetic clocks.

By assigning a single word to each generation, Solomon revealed the principal spiritual forces at work from the
dedication of the temple in 960 BC until the day the Lord ushers in eternal peace. His choice of words? Impeccable.
Here are the key events that occurred in half the twenty-eight times:

  - *A time to die*: Northern kingdom of Israel carried into captivity by Assyria.
  - *A time to plant*: Prosperous times for Judah under King Hezekiah.
  - *A time to uproot*: The Babylonian Exile of Judah uproots the Jews from their homeland.
  - *A time to kill*: Attempted genocide of all the Jews by Haman in the Book of Esther.
  - *A time to weep*: The Crucifixion of Jesus.
  - *A time to mourn*: Roman persecution of Christians peaks under Diocletian.
  - *A time to dance*: Rome becomes a Christian empire! Edict of Thessalonica issued in 380 AD.
  - *A time to throw away*: Byzantium abandoned to its fate.
  - *A time to tear*: Protestant Reformation & civil war tears the church apart.
  - *A time to mend*: Dawn of Religious freedom and tolerance.
  - *A time to be silent*: Christians listen to God during the Pietism Movement, Methodist Revival & Great Awakening.
  - *A time to speak*: Great age of Christian missions.
  - *A time to love*: Worldwide increase in health & prosperity and Israel reborn.
  - *A time to hate*: Worldwide persecution of Christians and Jews will soon begin.

The power of this clock is that it operates at different scales of time and on different levels of being.
It structures the history of...

  - a single person via the [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.md).
  - ancient Israel and the church as a unity via this clock
  - the secular world from the Creation until the end (via another clock)
  - modern Israel (via a clock in "Appendix C: A Time for Israel" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*)

It structures the levels of...

  - existence in the material world that Solomon calls life "under the sun"
  - existence in the spiritual world, as explained by Jesus in Matthew the Apostle Paul in his first seven letters

As illustrations of the spiritual dimension of Solomon's times:

  - A time to be born is being "born again"
  - A time to die is dying to self and gaining a new identity in Christ, as in Romans 6 and Galatians 2
  - A time to plant is being baptized into the fellowship of the church
  - A time to uproot is severing some ties with non-believers following salvation

With Solomon's times woven into so much of the material and spiritual order of the world, this means that
prophecy is also deeply personal. Neglecting its study is unwise.

You can find more information about this clock in the article [Twice a Thousand Years](./twice-a-thousand-years.html).

You can find more information about the spiritual analogs of the twenty-eight times in [The Righteous Fall Seven Times](./the-righteous-fall-seven-times.html) and [The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program](./pauls-discipleship-program.md).

## Solomon’s Son-dial

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes 1–10
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapters:
    - Solomons Sundial,
    - The Time of Her Confinement,
    - Rightly Dividing the Words
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)
  - Intervals: 28 (divided by the phrase “under the sun”)
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

Almost a decade ago, I turned my attention to Ecclesiastes. I wrote a program that tallied how often each word and short phrase
was used. The obvious result was that "under the sun" was Solomon's catch phrase. My clumsy research concluded that 
the structure and interpretation of Ecclesiastes was tied up in two things:

 - The poem of the twenty-eight times
 - The phrase "under the sun", which also appears twenty-eight times

It seemed sensible to ask, "Is the list of times a table of contents into the book?" I tried to map those words to
the content of the rest of the book and failed. Also, the phrase "under the sun" is distributed haphazardly.
It appears in one verse twice and in some chapters not at all, including the books two concluding chapters.
I soon abandoned my effort and would not return to Ecclesiastes until 2020. The sad thing is that I was right. 
I had correctly identified the two features of the book whose relationship you must understand in order to solve the riddles of its meaning.
I just didn't know what to do with them.

The twenty-eight times are not a table of contents into Ecclesiastes. They are a table of contents into a human life.
Ecclesiastes is a treatise on the stages of a human life, but some of the "times" are not addressed there.
They are however, addressed in Psalms, Proverbs, Matthew and the other [Seven Pillars of Wisdom](./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html).

As for the placement of the instances of "under the sun", that was subtle. They are the tick marks on a prophetic sundial. 
Even though they are spaced unevenly, they do divide the book into twenty-eight pieces and each piece does correspond to
one of the twenty-eight times, in sequence. Then the verses between the tick marks contains prophesies that point to events
in the matching era of history. That is why Ecclesiastes is so hard to understand! It is a rundown of all history from 
the dedication of the temple until Christ returns. By combining the time phrase and the words in the bracketed passage
you can understand part of God's plan for history and how it is all developed from an analogy to the life of a single person.

Here are where the "under the sun" references are found in Ecclesiastes and which time goes with each:

  - 1:3 Born
  - 1:9 Die
  - 1:14 Plant
  - 2:11 Uproot
  - 2:17 Kill
  - 2:18 Heal
  - 2:19 Tear down
  - 2:20 Build
  - 2:22 Weep
  - 3:16 Laugh
  - 4:1 Mourn
  - 4:3 Dance
  - 4:7 Scatter stones
  - 4:15 Gather stones
  - 5:13 Embrace
  - 5:18 Refrain
  - 6:1 Search
  - 6:12 Give up
  - 8:9 Keep
  - 8:15 Throw away
  - 8:17 Tear
  - 9:3 Mend
  - 9:6 Be Silent
  - 9:9 Speak, Love
  - 9:11 Hate
  - 9:13 War
  - 10:5 Peace

The subtlest riddle in the Bible is hidden in “a thousand years twice over” in Ecclesiastes 6:6, whose answer gives us 120 years
as the length of one of Solomon’s “times”. The solving of that riddle is the subject of [Twice a Thousand Years](./twice-a-thousand-years.html).

A few interesting prophecies that fall out of the book are: 

 1. On the “sun-dial”, the poem of the twenty-eight times occurs during “a time to weep” – when Jesus died for our sins, marking
that the most important of times.
 2. Verse 9:9 says “meaningless” and “under the sun” twice and has the book’s only positive use of “love”. It falls on “a time to speak” and “a time to love”, season of God’s greatest outpouring of mercy upon the world and the greatest era of overseas Christian missions.

In the chapter "Solomon's Sundial", the placement of the "under the sun" usages was also used as a scaffold to study the distribution of other common phrases throughout the book. One example should suffice. It is the word "wind" which is often used to indicate futility as in "chasing after the wind".

### Wind

Wind can mean “spirit”. The King James uses “vexation of spirit” in place of “chasing after the wind”.
The impossibilities of catching the wind, containing it, or
stopping its repetitive cycles are all conveyed by
Ecclesiastes. The endless cycle is introduced in 1:6 with 
*“The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.”* 
Then the futility of chasing it is found all over. Since we can’t take anything
with us when we die, 5:6 says we “toil for the wind”. In 8:8
we are reminded that we can’t hold onto our spirit and so
overcome death by the words “no one has power over the
wind to contain it...” The final mentions describe the
mysteriousness of the wind:

#### “Whoever watches the **wind** will not plant;
##### whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
#### As you do not know the path of the **wind**,
##### or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb,
#### so you cannot understand the work of God,
##### the Maker of all things."
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:4-5, NIV

It is no mystery which verses speak of the wind:

**1:6,14,17; 2:11,17,26; 4:4,6,16; 5:16; 6:9; 8:8; 11:4-5**

If the phrase occurs in a verse that falls between a pair of
“under the sun” verses, we will assume the “wind” phrase
is relevant to both corresponding “times”. If the phrase is
in the same verse as “under the sun”, we only match it with
one time.

For example, 1:6 includes “wind” and falls between 1:3
(born) and 1:9 (die), so it will be assigned both *born* and *die*.

On the other hand, 1:14 has both “under the sun” and
“chasing after the wind”, so it is only assigned the time
“plant”.

If you continue this for all fourteen “wind” verses, you
will collectively match seventeen of the times. You can
rationalize good reasons for each match, such as terrible
defeats or the destruction of the temple, but the clearest,
simplest story that they tell may only be inferred by looking
at the times that were NOT matched. Those unmatched
times are the the sundial’s shadow. They are clumped into
three groups of adjacent times:

  - Heal, Tear down, Build
  - Mourn
  - Throw away, Tear, Mend, Be silent, Speak, Love, Hate, War

What distinguishes these three periods of history from
the rest? Satan. The three times in the first group span the
silent years between the two testaments, when there were
no prophets to add to the Word of God, the darkest time for
Israel. That means the Spirit (the wind) was not at work
sending authoritative messages to Israel to add to the Bible.
The second group has one time, the time of the worst of
the Roman persecutions, under Diocletian. This is what
Revelation has to say about that time:

#### I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! 
#### I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews 
#### and are not, but are a synagogue of **Satan**. 
#### Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. 
#### I tell you, the **devil** will put some of you in prison 
#### to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. 
#### Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will 
#### give you life as your victor’s crown.
###### - Revelation 2:9-10, NIV

After that, there is a long stretch where wind appears
repeatedly. The millennium from “a time to dance” through
“a time to keep” constitutes the thousand years that Satan
was bound, between the Edict of Thessalonica and the
commencement of the long period of Ottoman sieges
against Constantinople, leading to its fall. The Spirit blew
freely during those years and experienced limited Satanic
opposition while the church grew.

After Satan was unbound, chaos ensued. Byzantium fell.
The Reformation split the church and led to centuries of
religious wars. More recently, the devil has deceived the
nations; apostasy has spread, as formerly Christian nations
abandon the faith. From “a time to throw away” to “a time
to hate” (in our near future), the wind is absent again. That
will end when history reaches “a time of war”. Christ will
return in the middle or end of that time, and the Holy Spirit
will complete his mission as well, as is revealed in
Revelation:

#### Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, 
#### standing at the center of the throne, encircled by 
#### the four living creatures and the elders. 
#### The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the
#### **seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth**.
###### - Revelation 5:6, NIV

Lest there be confusion, the Holy Spirit has never nor
will ever be entirely absent from this world. What the
preceding shows is that the balance of influence between
the Holy Spirit and Satan’s evil spirits has shifted over time,
first one way then the other. As the final two occurrences of
“wind” attest, we “do not know the path of the wind”.

## Lamps of the Ten Virgins

  - Bible book: Matthew 25
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: The Time of Her Confinement
  - Timespan: 1–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 10
  - Period: 240 years (per lamp)

**Notable facts:**

In this parable from Matthew 25, ten virgins are to wait for the Bridegroom to arrive for the wedding.
When he arrives, they are to meet him with lamps lit, attend to his needs
and make the final preparations for the wedding. However, the Bridegroom is long in coming.
The five foolish virgins did not plan for this and had run out of oil for their lamps.
While they are at the market buying more oil, the Bridegroom arrives and the wedding starts.
When they return, they are barred from entering the wedding and lose their right to participate
in the festivities.

When interpreted as a celestial clock, this parable assumes the clock began with Solomon but that
we can skip over the first eight times, which is four seasons. That is because Jesus ascended to heaven
(hence is the Bridegroom who went away until it was time for the wedding) during the ninth time,
a time to weep. From "a time to weep" to "a time for peace" is twenty times or equivalently ten seasons.

With that understood, each virgin with a lamp stands for one of Solomon’s “seasons”, which is
made up of two 120-year “times”. During five of those ten seasons, women of the church were prepared, 
including the current season. One ill-prepared season remains. All told, the women of the church
were prepared during these seasons:

  - Season 5: a time to weep and a time to laugh (1-240 AD)
  - Season 6: a time to mourn and a time to dance (240-480 AD)
  - Season 11: a time to tear and a time to mend (1440-1680 AD)
  - Season 12: a time to be silent and a time to speak (1680-1920 AD)
  - Season 13: a time to love and a time to hate (1920-2160 AD)

In the beginning of the church, women were the first to see the risen Christ, participated actively 
in running churches in their homes and assisting in missionary efforts.
During the years when the women of the church were not prepared, whose fault was that?
Women were progressively excluded from positions in the church from 360-480 AD.
Then on the other side, the Protestant Reformation promoted the priesthood of all believers.
Protestant schools taught women to read and they slowly began to progress towards equality.

Why should we conclude that this parable is about whether the church respects and trains up
women for service? The parable has many layers of meaning. On the surface, a wise or foolish virgin is
an individual Christian, male or female, who has taken initiative to prepare for the return of Christ
through learning the doctrines of the faith and obeying them conscientiously through acts of service.
On a higher level, it is whole churches, since Revelation tells us that lamp stands stand for churches. 
On the highest level, it is whole eras of the church age, when the church as a whole was either prepared
or not. The identification of the preparedness or unpreparedness of women is offered as a synedoche, a single, identifiable
sign and symptom of the church's condition that stands for the whole of its problems.

The parable does not tell us which church ages were prepared or not. For that we must add in information from:

  - Church history
  - Other prophecies, like the letters to the Seven Churches in Revelation

The chapter "Seven Churches for Seven Eras" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* matches the seven named churches
to seven eras of history, using evidence from scripture, church history and archaeology. The assigned dates for the
early church ages are similar to those proposed by scholars at the time of the Reformation, while
those for the later ages are based on my own research.

The churches that Jesus mostly praised can be identified with the prepared virgins. The churches that Jesus had the harshest criticism 
for can be identified with the foolish virgins. Those seven eras are not uniform in length, but by placing them 
alongside the ten seasons of this parable, you will find that the praised church eras constitute half of church history.

In the following chart, two thirds of the way down the image are two rows labeled "Ten Virgins" and "Letters to the Seven Churches".
The blocks labeled "YES" are the eras when the church was prepared. These are those prepared church ages:

  - Ephesus (33-100 AD)
  - Smyrna (100-313 AD)
  - Pergamum (313-550 AD) Only the first third or so of this era was prepared. As the era progressed, the acceptable roles of women were progressively diminished by popes and councils.
  - Philadelphia (1453-1990 AD)
  - Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The church will be prepared during the first half of this, our current era, but steadily lose ground.

The unprepared church eras were:

  - Pergamum (313-550 AD) The second two-thirds of the era.
  - Thyatira (550-964 AD) The whole era.
  - Sardis (964-1453 AD) The whole era.
  - Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The second half of the era.

  <img class="wide" src="images/patterns-correlated.png" alt="Many wisdom patterns correlated" />
</a>

A time of darkness will one day come when no one can work. The time of war will 
test us all. Will women be prepared for this? Will men?

## Grand Father Clock

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: [A Grand Father Clock & a Silver Cord](./grandfather-clock.html)
  - Timespan: 4020 BC–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 42 (plus a short one)
  - Period: 175 years (for 28 eras), 100 years (for 14 eras)

**Notable facts:**

One reason why scholars are stumped by Ecclesiastes is that it has multiple prophetic 
sequences overlaying one another. The same passage may have some verses that are prophecies for one clock
while having other verses that are part of a second. Ecclesiastes has at least four:

  1. The poem of Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 describes a clock from the temple dedication to Christ's return.
  2. The major portion of the book describes a clock from the temple dedication to Christ's return, divided into eras by the phrase "under the sun".
  3. The whole book describes a clock from the Creation to Christ's return, divided into eras first by the phrase "under the sun", then by other textual clues.
  4. The major portion of the book describes a clock from the Holocaust to Christ's return, divided into eras by the phrase "under the sun".

The first two listed above go hand in hand. They describe the growth of ancient Israel and a remnant's transformation into the church as
a unit from birth to full maturity. When Christ returns, the church will be spiritually vital. The bride will be ready and in her prime.

The third clock listed above describes the growth of human civilization from birth to maturity to decline to death. It covers the whole
life arc of Ecclesiastes, not omitting the days of darkness and decline. It does not have a happy ending like the other three.

The fourth clock governs the history of modern Israel.

This section is about the third clock above, for all humanity. It follows the rise and fall of human civilization
through three phases:

  - years of growth (28 times of 175 years each) from 4020 BC-880 AD
  - productive years (12 times of 100 years each) from 880-2080 AD
  - years of decline (2 times) from 2080-2280 AD or beyond

It identifies the centuries in which:

  - Satan would be unbound (1380–1480 AD)
  - New printing technology would let “fools multiply words”
  - Kingdoms would have kings to rule as fools (1580–1680 AD), during the General Crisis
  - Or rule as wise (1680–1780 AD), during the Enlightenment
  - Or do away with kings altogether (1780–1880 AD), as democracy and revolution spread
  - To be followed by Feasting (1880–1980 AD), as health, long life and prosperity spread worldwide

Let's zoom in on one verse to get the flavor. Ecclesiastes 10 is an extended metaphor for building a house.
Is that not a fitting analogy for building a civilization? Setting aside for now how the calculation was made,
the first half of verse 9 may be associated with the era 1180-1280 AD.

#### Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them... 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:9a

A modern work site sees an endless stream of trucks dropping off supplies. The masonry work may require
marble, granite, brick, natural stone or cinder blocks. This verse, about quarrying stone, 
is the most on-the-nose verse in the chapter. The late twelfth and thirteenth centuries were the peak of the age of church building. Many of the great cathedrals were constructed during this century. It is estimated that during
this phase of the establishment of Christendom, more stone was quarried for churches than was used for all the
pyramids and temples of Ancient Egypt combined. A few decades into the next era, the addition of a new spire
to the Lincoln Cathedral made it the tallest building in the world, a title it held for 237 years.
(Prior to that, the Pyramid of Giza held the title for 3,800 years!)

This clock chronicles the rise and fall of modern Western Civilization. It is sobering to hear about its approaching demise.

**Notable facts:**

The Seven Historical Psalms have long been regarded as a unit. 
They look backward on Israel's history and most have references to the plagues on Egypt,
parting of the Red Sea and initial conquest of the land.
Each of the Psalms has ties to one of the seven phases of the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html),
so that pattern organizes and sequences them into a larger pattern.
The retrospective focus hides the prophetic intent. The true goal of these psalms is to look forward
to what God will do next. How do we know this? The psalmist tells us!

#### Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
##### incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
#### I will open my mouth in a **parable**;
##### I will utter **dark sayings** from of old,
#### things that we have heard and known,
##### that our fathers have told us.
###### - Psalm 78:1-3

In place of "dark sayings" some translations use "riddles", "puzzling problems" or "mysteries".
It is our privilege to probe those mysteries and perhaps solve them. 

Each of these seven psalms has its own prophetic clock. Some selections:

**Psalm 105** picks just seven of the ten plagues against Egypt and reorders them to each match a different millennium.

  - The fifth plague of hail destroys fig tree and vine, but not olive tree, signifying that Israel would lose their political power (the fig tree) and receive no more prophets (the vine), but their religion (the olive tree) would continue. The time would be the fifth millennium, which began with the birth of Christ and the total loss of sovereignty to Rome and later the Islamic empires and Crusaders.
  - The sixth plague, of locusts, matches the sixth millennium’s fit of European colonial expansion. This is not the only Bible prophecy that likens those colonial empires to locusts. See [153 and the Fifth Trumpet](./153-and-the-fifth-trumpet.html) for an interpretation of the blowing of the Fifth Trumpet in Revelation.

**Psalm 106** also offers a millennial clock.

 - For the fifth millennium, it predicts the people would “not believe his promise” (106:24), i.e. reject the messiah, and be exiled a second time, when God “scatter\[s\] them throughout the lands.” (106:24-27)
 - For the sixth millennium, this psalm predicts the AIDS epidemic.

**Psalm 107** parallels the 28 times of Ecclesiastes 3 in structure as well as mirroring the 
sevenfold harvest pattern. It covers the period 33–2280 AD and allocates 321 years for
each four “times”. For example, Psalm 107:10-16, which corresponds to
weeping, laughing, mourning and dancing, describes the Dark Ages, using the word darkness four times.
Then Psalm 107:23-32, corresponding to the times to search, to
give up, to keep, and throw away, describes a sea voyage. This
matches the era of sea exploration, when the church reached
the Americas.

The most amazing prophecy is one that correctly identifies the
order in which the Jewish people would return to Israel from
exile, in Psalm 107:1-3. The sequence was from the hand of the
foe (Hitler’s Germany), from the east (Iran, Iraq, etc.), from the
west (Egypt, North Africa), from the north (Iron Curtain
countries including Russia), and from the south (the rest of the
world). This prophecy also correctly identifies the direction of
expansion in the five major periods of Christian expansion.

For a detailed analysis of Psalm 107, see the article [Psalm 107: Where is the Love?](./psalm-107.html).

**Psalm 136** has 26 of Solomon’s 28 times, with the two
remaining times being found in the two Biblical events at which
this psalm was recited: the temple dedication and before a
battle when King Jehoshaphat faced an overwhelming force.
This psalm prophecies dozens of events, including the coming
of Christ (“the sun to govern the day”), the Byzantine Empire’s
successful raid of Damietta, Egypt in 853 AD, the flight to the
Americas of the pilgrims, the abolition of slavery, and the
defeat of Hitler.

**Why would God put so many prophesies in the Psalms?**

Twenty-five years ago, I didn't even like poetry. When I came across it in the Bible, I endured it.
It struck me as emotional and imprecise - I am an engineer. The narratives told stories rich in detail, 
the sequencing of events and logical forms that I could sink my intellectual teeth into. 
Paul's letters, though poetic in expression, communicated intricate philosophical ideas and doctrines.

It was not until I began writing my novels that I got hooked. I blame God. I decided that
my hero's wife was a literature professor. While he was in a coma, I had her read poetry to him at his bedside
in the hospital. What kind of poems does a lit teacher like? To write her character convincingly,
I forced myself to read lots of poems as part of my research. I didn't know it at the time, but writing 
that novel was my education in how to read and enjoy poetry. It would be essential years later when I 
faced Job and later the Psalms. You cannot understand what you do not love.

Discovering the prophetic content of the Psalms required years of study.
The book is so large and complex that a single assault on this fortress of knowledge
can never breach its walls. My first success was with [Psalm 119](./psalm-119.html). These seven Psalms came next.
Then in short order, Psalms 102 and the seven Thunder Psalms. After that, other structures, like
the first twenty-eight psalms matching the twenty-eight times of Solomon followed,
plus the notable pairing of Psalms 111 and 112. Bringing up the rear was my discovery of the riches hidden 
in Psalm 19, said by C. S. Lewis to be the greatest in the psalter and among the greatest poems ever written.
I am convinced that I have still only scratched the surface.

This brings us to the question. Why the Psalms? Why put so many prophecies there? Poems in antiquity
had regular and intricate structures. Some of their forms have only been rediscovered in the last century or so.
This regularity with subtlety is ready-made as a matrix upon which to stamp and conceal mysteries.
The subjective emotions and colorful imagery can easily encode truths. If you add enough layers to the text,
readers will likely give up after piercing a few but before they reach the bottom.

Given that my engineering mind recoiled for so long from undertaking a careful study of the Bible's poetry,
I think God did it to thumb his nose at the world's intellectuals. I am glad I finally relented and
discovered in God's poetry the truths that my heart longed to find.

## Matthew’s Monthly Planner

  - Bible book: Matthew
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: One Greater than Solomon
  - Timespan: 33–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 321 years per four times

**Notable facts:**

This clock shows that every chapter of Matthew corresponds to
one of Solomon’s twenty-eight times, making Jesus the new Solomon.
Here are some highlights:

Here is a selection of the findings from the chapter. In my book, this "planner" showed two things for
most chapters:

  - Verses whose theme was then related to the time phrase from Solomon's poem of twenty-eight times.
  - A prophetic interpretation tying other verses from the chapter to later history according to the clock.

In the table below, I have mostly dispensed with the passages that refer to Solomon's times and focus on the 
prophecies.

I was able to find for every chapter of Matthew some content that matches the corresponding time from Solomon's poem.
I was not able to find prophecies for every chapter. However, every time I look at Matthew, I find more. 
Just today (June 22, 2024) I found three more, so have included them, even though they were not in the book as published.

    This chapter recounts the Baptism of Jesus (3:13-17). John the Baptist challenges
    the leaders to produce the fruit of repentance (3:7-10).
    Then we see Jesus as a contrast. Compare to this Psalm,
    which describes Jesus planted by the water, producing good fruit: 
    <br/>
    <em> That person is like a tree <br/>
    planted by streams of water, <br/>
    which yields its fruit in season <br/>
    and whose leaf does not wither— <br/>
    whatever they do prospers. (Psalm 1:3) </em>
    <br/>

    During the reign of Emperor Gallienus (253-268) and for a few decades afterward, 
    the “Little Peace of the Church” gave the church a reprieve. It put down roots and grew rapidly 
    because it had been well-planted and watered.

    <br/>
     Though many heresies have beset the church, Arianism is considered to have been the worst threat. 
     Though the Arian heresy began in the 4th century, it posed the greatest threat politically and
    spiritually during the 6th. When Ulfilas translated the Bible into Gothic and evangelized the Germanic
    peoples, he brought his Arian views with him. Different Germanic tribes raided the south frequently 
    and the 6th century saw the territory held by Arians grow substantially. Emperor Justinian opposed them
    forcefully during this era. Much of Italy fell to the Ostrogoths; Spain to the Visigoths; 
    and north Africa to the Vandals. In addition to Germanic peoples, the Lombards also conquered parts 
    of Italy under the sway of Arianism. <br>
    <br/>
    Totila, leader of the Ostrogoths, vowed to level Rome after he captured it in 546, but relented. 
    Even so, the might of Rome was torn down, in keeping with this era’s theme.
    Interestingly, wolves were symbolic representatives of both Rome and the Germanic peoples. 
    However, Rome emphasized the nurturing aspects of wolves; Romulus and Remus, who founded Rome, 
    were said to have been abandoned by the river but rescued by a wolf, who suckled and raised them. 
    The Germans emphasized wolves’ fierceness, savagery and bravery. Thus the wolves in sheep’s clothing 
    were Germanic tribes practicing a false version of Christianity.

    What do you build, if not a house? Matthew 8 speaks three times of houses:<br/>
    <br/>
    1. <strong>The house of the Centurion</strong>. The centurion replied,
    <em>“Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my
    roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.” (8:8)</em> <br/>
    <br/>
    2. <strong>The house of Peter</strong>. <em>When Jesus came into Peter’s
    house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a
    fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, and
    she got up and began to wait on him. (8:14-15) </em> <br/>
    <br/>
    3. <strong>The house of Jesus</strong>: He has none! Jesus replied, 
    <em>“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” (8:20)</em>
    In the case of the centurion and Peter, their houses were built on faith. In the case of Jesus, he has no house
    because he is busy building houses for us. <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus we have houses for the Centurion, Peter, Foxes, Birds, and Jesus - five houses. <br/>
    <br/>
    The ancient church had five patriarchates: Rome (founded by Peter), Constantinople (founded by Andrew), Alexandria (founded by Mark), Antioch (also founded by Peter), and Jerusalem (founded by James). 
    Thus we can match Peter to Rome and the Centurion to Constantinople, since in this era Constantinople inherited
    Rome's place as seat of government. That leaves dens, nests and the open sky for Christians from the other three
    patriarchates. That is because in this era, the forces of Islam conquered the Middle East. They captured
    Alexandria, Jerusalem and Antioch. Christians in those parts now were like Jesus, without a home.

    Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into
    his harvest field.” (9:36-38)</em> <br/>
    <br/>
    The period 675-755 AD falls midway between two major
    expansions of Christianity, in the middle of Islam’s first
    major expansion. Rome had fallen long before and
    Christian unity was weak. What did Jesus’ prayer do? In
    Ireland, they built a missionary training center and sent
    missionaries to Scotland and Iceland. Translations of the
    Bible were rendered in Arabic and Old English. And

    Charlemagne used that sword to conquer the Saxons and many others, imposing
    Christianity and his rule upon most of Western Europe.

    <em> "All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." - Matthew 11:27 </em> <br/>
    <br/>
    One of the most impactful events of this era caused the rift between the churches of the East and West to grow.
    In 867 AD, Photius convened the Council of Constantinople to address two issues. One was Rome's assertion of Papal Supremacy over all other churches and patriarchs. The second was the use of the Filioque, the addition 
    by Rome of the phrase "and also the Son" to the creed to indicate that the Holy Spirit proceeds from
    both Father and Son, not just the Father alone. The Greeks denied that the Holy Spirit proceeds from
    the Son. To modern ears, such a dispute seems absurd, minuscule and technical. Nevertheless, it helped split the
    church in two. Two centuries later, Saint Anselm wrote <em>De processione Spiritus Sancti</em> to defend
    the Roman Catholic position. The heart of his defense employed Matthew 11:27, quoted above. 
    For a good summary of Anselm's argument, see <a href="https://unamsanctamcatholicam.com/2022/05/12/st-anselm-on-the-filioque/">St. Anselm on the Filioque</a>. <br/>
    <br/>
    What is the conclusion? Jesus knew that the church would divide over this issue over 800 years before it happened
    and ensured that the words that could resolve the issue were slotted into the right chapter of Matthew.
    Sadly, the church didn't listen; we didn't listen to the very words of the one we were arguing about.

    “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
    He replied to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
    Pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my

    brother and sister and mother.” (12:46-50)
    </em> <br/>
    <br/>
    Devotion to Mary existed from the earliest days of Christianity and doctrines related to her person 
    slowly spread throughout the church. The 11th century saw a marked increase in devotion to Mary, 
    and in the early 12th century, Eadmer of Canterbury wrote a treatise that
    ultimately persuaded the Catholic Church to promulgate the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. 
    After that, things snowballed, with the creation of prayers,
    rosaries, cathedrals called Notre Dame, pilgrimage sites
    related to Marian apparitions and societies dedicated to
    her name. <br/>
    <br/>
    Personally, I accept the doctrine of Theotokos (Mary as the Mother of God), 
    am unsure about perpetual virginity (but see solid scriptural arguments for it), 
    am ambivalent about the Assumption into Heaven, and am skeptical of the rest. 
    Yet I see these words of Jesus: <br>
    <strong>Who is my mother?</strong> <br/>
    <br/>
    To my Protestant sensibilities, these words were once a
    stinging rebuke by Jesus to his family. Obedient faith
    counted for more than blood. After all, Jesus said that
    believers must be ready to leave family to follow him.
    But now I see these words differently. They were a
    challenge to us to find out exactly who his mother was.
    What was she like? What role does she or should she
    play in the church? The question must be asked. Jesus
    asked it and the Catholic Church asked it. Protestants
    almost never ask it. I may not like the Catholic answers,
    but at least they poured centuries of prayer, reflection
    and logic into answering it. Isn’t it peculiar that they
    started asking those questions in the era right after the
    time bracketed by this chapter? (See “Aftertaste: Donner and Blitzen” for a more compelling prophecy 
    regarding the promulgation of Marian doctrines.)

    In this chapter, Jesus feeds the 5,000, he gathers crowds to feed, gathers sick people to heal, and gathers leftovers. (14:13-21) <br/>
    <br/>
    In this era, God performed a greater miracle: the feeding of millions. <br/>
    <br/>
    The Medieval Warm period began around 950 AD. This did not have an immediate impact on
    agriculture in northern Europe. Starting around 1050 AD and continuing for the next three centuries, 
    harvest yields doubled. Formerly, half of all grain used to be needed for the next year’s planting. 
    This doubling of output meant that only a third of the grain needed to be held in reserve for the next year.
    The net effect was to triple the amount of grain available for food.<br/>
    <br/>
    In addition to the weather, there were other causes:
    <ul>
      <li>The cessation of Viking raids.</li>
      <li>The introduction of new farm practices, like three field crop rotation. </li>
      <li>Better plows. Light plows were suitable for the Mediterranean, barely scratching the surface to 
      preserve the moisture from evaporating. The development of heavy plows that cut deep furrows was needed in the north because the ground was too wet.</li>
      <li>To draw the new, heavy plows without oxen, you needed another invention, the horse collar; 
      using ox yokes on horses choked the horses and cut off air to their lungs.</li>
      <li>The harrow was developed to break the clods and bury the seed after the rough plowing and seed scattering.</li>
      <li>Water mills were developed to grind the grain into flour.</li>
      <li>Hoes</li>
      <li>horse shoes</li> 
    </ul>
    Most of these things were invented a century or two before and far away, but finally reached the north in this era.
    This phenomenal growth in northern Europe’s agricultural system caused European life expectancy to
    increase by ten years, its population to double, and shifted the balance of power away from the Mediterranean.
    We can give sole credit to human ingenuity, but if the one called the Bread of Life predicted this miracle that could feed
    millions a thousand years before, should not our praises be directed elsewhere?

    At the Transfiguration (17:1-13), the disciples are
    confused why Elijah - whom they saw beside Jesus - was
    not appearing to all Israel to persuade them that
    Messiah had come. Elijah was whom all the people were
    told to search for, but they did not recognize him, as he
    came spiritually in the person of John the Baptist.
    If you have religious expectations, how do you test to
    see if they are well-founded? Are you searching for the wrong things? <br/>
    <br/>
    Another example of searching is when Jesus tells Peter
    to search for a fish with a four-drachma coin in its
    mouth to use for the Temple tax. That would seem to be
    an unreasonable thing to spend time searching for, yet
    Jesus commanded it. Knowing what to search for is not
    a simple proposition!<br/>
    <br/>
    A good example of searching is found in the following
    chapter, in the Parable of the Wandering Sheep
    (18:10-14). Though not in the same chapter, it is in the
    same larger section of the growth pattern –
    opportunity. Interestingly, the placement of a story
    about searching in a chapter about “a time to give up”
    adds the richness of irony to the meaning. Jesus was
    telling them that they would never abandon their
    property – a sheep, but they were abandoning their
    neighbors who were in need. <br/>
    <br/>
    Prophetically, the Hesychast controversy (1337-1351 AD) erupted between the eastern and western church. 
    It concerned a mystical way to search for God. Western rational scholastic approaches to knowledge were
    incompatible with the mystical traditions of the east. In hesychastic practice, inner contemplation is supposed
    to permit the believer to experience God’s uncreated light, the same light that emanated from Jesus at his
    Transfiguration. Gregory Palamas proposed the Essence-Energies distinction which became standard
    Eastern Orthodox doctrine. We cannot see God’s essence, but we can see his energies. <br/>
    <br/>
    The upshot is that the disciples were confused by the meaning of the glory shining from Jesus at his Transfiguration,
    and over a millennium later, the church was still arguing about what to make of that glory.
    A decade ago, I fasted for three years, praying for God to show me His glory.

    To enter the kingdom of heaven, we need to give up our pride and become like a little child. (18:1-5) <br/>
    We also need to give up things that make us stumble, like a symbolic eye or foot. (18:8-9) <br/>
    We need to give up our place of safety among the ninety-nine in the flock and search for the lost sheep. (18:12-14) <br/>
    Sadly, if after repeated overtures to an offending brother or sister come to naught, we must give up on them 
    and expel them from the church. (18:15-17) <br/>
    Lastly, we are called upon to give up our grudges and forgive or face eternity in prison. (18:21-35) <br/>
    <br/>
    Prophetically, during this era the Lord gave up on Constantinople, which fell in 1453.
    What was the cause? There were many causes, but one is symbolic and fits the timing of this disaster. C
    onsider Jesus’ answer to Peter: <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>
    Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how many times could my
    brother sin against me and I forgive him? As many as seven times?
    “I tell you, not as many as seven,” Jesus said to him, "but 70 times
    seven. (Matthew 18:21-22, HCSB)
    </em>
    <br/>
    Some translations say we are to forgive seventy-seven
    times, while others, like the HCSB, assume the words
    “seventy sevens” means seventy times seven, or 490.
    The parable of the unforgiving servant is about
    unforgiveness. On a macroscopic level, what is the
    historical manifestation of unforgiveness? It is civil war. <br/>
    <br/>
    The Byzantine Empire was beset by civil war throughout its history. 
    From the 4th to the 15th centuries there were 119 wars and revolts, 
    spanning a cumulative 294 years. The 7th and 8th centuries were two of the worst. 
    However the longest sustained period of civil unrest was from the 11th
    to the 14th centuries. Of this 400 year period, 156 years were troubled by civil war and revolts. 
    The only thing that prevented the 15th century from going the same way was their final conquest by the Turks.
    That captures the qualitative spirit of God’s complaint against that empire. <br/>
    <br/>
    Now for the quantitative part. Numerous theological disagreements drove
    Constantinople and Rome apart. One such disagreement may not be the gravest of them, but it is
    among the oldest and comes up in any discussion of what divides east and west. 
    It is the addition by the Roman Catholic Church of the Filioque clause to the Nicene Creed. 
    The oldest form of the creed said that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father. 
    The Filioque clause is the tacking on of the words “and the Son”.
    Does the Spirit only proceed from the Father, which is clearly stated in Scripture? 
    Or does it also proceed from the Son? That latter may be inferred from the Bible, but
    is not stated explicitly. <br/>
    <br/>
    The debate involves attempts by the Catholic Church to show that the addition occurred very early
    and should be accepted as part of church tradition. The Orthodox Church contends that the addition 
    was made much later and should be rejected as not having been approved by
    an Ecumenical Council and on other grounds. According to Wikipedia: <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“Some scholars claim that the earliest example of the Filioque clause in the East is
    contained in the West Syriac recension of the profession of
    faith of the Church of the East formulated at the Council of
    Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Persia in 410.” </em> <br/>
    <br/>
    A few earlier Christian writers subscribed to the idea, but the church
    had previously not made a ruling on it. One author to address the subject was Augustine, 
    who affirmed the substance of the Filioque in De Trinitate, released in 419 AD, but begun in 399 AD.  <br/>
    <br/>
    Thus let us assume the year 400 AD as a starting point for this controversy.
    The rancor of the debate increased for centuries.
    Charlemagne entered the fray in 787 AD, accusing Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople of infidelity for not
    affirming that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son. Things came to a head in the next century, during the
    Photian controversy. Again, from Wikipedia: <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>Around 860 the controversy over the Filioque broke out in the course
    of the disputes between Patriarch Photius of Constantinople and
    Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople. In <em>867</em>, Photius was Patriarch
    of Constantinople and issued an Encyclical to the Eastern
    Patriarchs, and called a council in Constantinople in which he
    charged the Western Church with heresy and schism because of
    differences in practices, in particular for the Filioque and the
    authority of the Papacy. <em>This moved the issue from jurisdiction
    and custom to one of dogma.</em> This council declared Pope Nicholas
    anathema, excommunicated and deposed. </em> <br/>
    <br/>
    So in 867 AD, rejection of the Filioque became an official dogma of the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
    This crisis continued to unfold over the next two decades, with more church councils and political actions occurring.
    Now for the punchline. Let us break the Filioque controversy into two eras: <br/>
    <ul>
      <li>400–890 AD: The east grows in opposition</li>
      <li>890–1380 AD: The east solidifies their opposition</li>
    </ul>
    Each era lasted 490 years. So when Jesus said that you should forgive your brothers seventy times seven times
    (or 490 times), was he referring to this offense? The year 1380 was when – according to the eschatological
    framework of this book – Satan was unbound and turned loose upon the Byzantine empire. 
    The period of forgiveness for the 867 Encyclical was up. An unrepentant and unforgiving empire had exhausted the
    patience of God and was abandoned to the devil for its judgment.

    Opposing divorce, Jesus says a man should <strong>keep</strong> his wife. (19:3-12) <br/>

    Then Jesus says “everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields
    for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.” (19: 29) <br/>
    <br/>
    So to get and keep eternal life, you must leave everything else behind, a paradox. <br/>
    <br/>
    Jesus spoke against divorce, but in the prophetic era the western Church underwent a bloody spiritual divorce. 
    The Protestant Reformation created the greatest rupture in the church since the Great Schism,

    The prophecy for this era was the publication in 1559 AD of the complete version of
    Calvin’s <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>. 
    Among the ideas he forwarded was penal substitutionary atonement (a name not applied to it until much later),

    Later in the gospel, when Jesus addresses the end times,

    <em>Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill;

    <em>So render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.</em> <br/>

    His brilliant answer set forth the idea that there are two spheres of authority both set in place by God, the church and the state, each deserving of its own respect. During this prophetic era, the United States of America was founded,

    This was God’s call to eliminate slavery. This era began with
    England’s abolition of the slave trade and ended with
    the American Civil War and Reconstruction.
    The connection to freeing slaves and prisoners is
    reinforced by Jesus’ reference to Zechariah: <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been
    shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of
    Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. (Matthew 23:35)</em> <br/>
    <br/>
    And here is what Zechariah said when he announced what the blood of the covenant would do:<br/>
    <br/>
    <em>As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you,<br/>
    I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.<br/>
    Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope;<br/>
    even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.<br/>

    <br/>
    We should all aspire to be prisoners – not of men, but of hope. <br/>
    <br/>
    Jesus said something else that was prophetic:<br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing. Look, your house is left to you desolate." - Matthew 23:37-38</em> <br/>
    <br/>
    Jerusalem of the 19th century was desolate. The population was less than 40,000, with perhaps 13,000 of them Jewish. By Ottoman law, the name of a Jew could not appear on a property deed.
    This changed with the Land Emancipation Act of 1876, near the end of this era. Finally Jews could own property,
    so they began to return from exile.

    <br/>
    Regarding wars and famines, this era includes WW I, WW II, the Holodomor, and the Great Chinese famine (1958-1962).

    As Jesus foretold, in this era opportunities for women to be educated,
    find work in all professions and in the church exploded. As a result, many “virgins” are now prepared. <br/>

    The church also grew rapidly, showing that the second servant’s two talents were well invested. <br/>
    <br/>
    And the world now produces more food, delivers more clean water, manufactures more clothes and liberates 
    more enslaved people than ever before. <br/>

    they also offer the possibility that the last time or two
    get stretched out, due to humanity perfecting new
    medicine that extends life. In addition, the fractal
    nature of God’s word makes it likely that this period of
    2120–2200 is a time of war, to be followed by a false time
    of peace when the world believes it has defeated the
    church and God, which time will end with the true final

## Moses’ Commandment Clock

  - Bible book: Exodus 7-11, 19, 20
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Aftertaste: Donner and Blitzen
  - Timespan: 1–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 10 (one per plague/commandment)
  - Period: 240 years

**Notable facts**:

This clock shows that analogies to Moses’ plagues against Egypt
are being repeated during the church age as judgments against
the church and the world.

Moses lived to the age of 120 years, so:

<div class="pullquote-centered">
  <p>(10 plagues + 10 Commandments) x 120 years = 2400 years</p>
</div>

The last period will be cut short. Some plagues prophesy God’s judgments against
the church (for discipline), others against the world.

  - The 1st plague (blood on the Nile) was Christ’s Crucifixion.
  - The 2nd plague (of frogs) matched the rise of the Frankish Merovingian Kings, whose crest of arms bore three frogs.
  - The 5th plague (on livestock) preceded Mongol invasions.
  - The 6th plague (of boils) matched the Black Plague as judgement upon the church for breaking the 6th commandment, against murder.
  - The 7th plague (hail & thunder) was the 17th C General Crisis.
  - The 8th plague (of locusts) was European colonial expansion breaking the 8th commandment: Thou shalt not steal.
  - The 9th plague (of darkness) is the darkness of lies, starting with Hitler’s “Big Lie” philosophy, first enunciated in Mein Kampf, published in 1925.

In *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*, two more clocks were found that applied these principles to Israel and to a series of ten empires respectively.

## Rebirth of Israel Clock

- Bible books: Ecclesiastes, Psalm 107
- Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
- Chapter: Appendix C: A Time for Israel
- Timespan: 1942–2280 AD
- Intervals: 28
- Period: 12.5 years (a 50-year jubilee per quartet)

**Notable facts:**

Starting with the Nazi death camps of 1942, this clock follows
the history of modern Israel from its birth up until Christ
returns. The new Israel will celebrate six jubilees, six fifty-year periods, 
before the Lord returns prior to the seventh. Here is a taste of that clock, 
what it had to say about the rebirth of Israel, during the first quartet of times, 
the Security phase of the [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.html).

In the following, the Grand Index is a reference to how Ecclesiastes may be broken into twenty-eight pieces
using the phrase "under the sun" as a divider. Each piece then maps to one of the twenty-eight times
of Ecclesiastes 3.

**Security**

  - A time to be born: 1942–1955 AD
  - A time to die: 1955-1967 AD
  - A time to plant: 1967–1980 AD
  - A time to uproot: 1980–1992 AD

Ecclesiastes begins with a riddle:

#### What has been will be again,
##### what has been done will be done again;
###### there is nothing new under the sun.
#### Is there anything of which one can say,
##### “Look! This is something new”?
#### It was here already, long ago;
##### it was here before our time.
###### - Ecclesiastes 1:9-10

According to the Grand Index, this riddle falls between “a time to be born” and “a time to die”. 
“What has been will be again” is the nation of Israel. The death of its people in the
Holocaust preceded its rebirth in 1948, like history moving
in reverse. The chapter [Psalm 107: Where is the Love?](./psalm-107.html)
went through the immigration records for Israel to prove
that the refugees returned from the land of the foe, the
east, the west, and the sea (south) in the order prophesied.

Two monumental events marked off the second time
(1955–1967). “A time to die” began with the Suez War of 1956
and concluded with the Six Day War of 1967.

The third time, “a time to plant”, saw Israeli agricultural
output (like its famed Jaffa oranges) increase dramatically.
In 1973, a Jewish botanist even perfected a variety of
tomato that ripens slower, dramatically reducing loss due
to spoilage (which had been 40% of the crop). This was
predicted by Solomon, in this passage that matches "a time to plant" 
according to the Grand Index:

#### I made gardens and parks
##### and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
#### I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.
###### - Ecclesiastes 2:5-6

The fourth time, “a time to uproot”, was a beneficial
uprooting. Jews from Russia and other Iron Curtain nations
were uprooted from their homes and migrated to Israel,
culminating at the end of this era with the arrival of several
million Jews in the space of a couple years.

In another instance of God hiding a great blessing in the
guise of objectionable language, we have this prophecy, a true [emotional riddle](./riddles.html):

#### I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves
#### who were born in my house...
###### - Ecclesiastes 2:7a

The USSR instituted a “diploma tax” in 1972 to prevent a brain drain. 
To get a visa to emigrate, some Jewish professionals had to pay twenty times 
their annual salary to meet the tax! Other communist countries had similar
policies. Israel paid to release as many as they could afford. Thus the nation
of Israel did buy “slaves” – in order to set them free!

## Hezekiah’s Celestial Clock

  - Bible books: Ecclesiastes, Psalm 102, Isaiah
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: Appendix D: To Number our Psalms
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

Prophecies in Psalm 102 focus on the period between the 816 year period
Muslim Siege of Jerusalem in 637 AD and the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD. 
That period of time is a multiple of the Psalm’s number, since:

**816 years = 8 x 102**

As for the number eight, the time between the sieges spans eight (8) of Solomon’s times. 
Furthermore, to direct our attention to the start of the crucial time, the psalm helpfully
includes in the preceding verse the phrase “the appointed time”.

The time I spent studying this Psalm was sweet. Hezekiah has long been one of my favorite 
Bible personalities. It is likely that he or someone from his court wrote Psalm 102 to speak 
of Hezekiah's faith amid his suffering. Look here for a detailed analysis of the poem:

[Psalm 102](./psalm-102.html).

**Notable facts**:

The first three chapters of Proverbs look back to the first three
millennia, respectively. Chapter 1 corresponds to the Son,
chapter 2 to the Holy Spirit, and chapter 3 to the Father.
The remaining twenty-eight chapters correspond to
Solomon’s twenty-eight times, and begin in 960 BC. The
conclusion is the wedding supper of the lamb, which
occurs once the church has been perfected and become
the wife of noble character of Proverbs 31.
