title: Celestial Clocks
---
Genesis 1 tells us that on the fourth day, God created the sun, moon and stars to govern day and night and regulate days, seasons and years.
They are God's celestial time pieces. These heavenly bodies move through the skies with mechanical precision, the
attribute par excellence of the Celestial Clock. In Solomon's inventory of types of prophetic clocks, they come second, after the generation clocks:

#### The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
##### and hastens to the place where it rises.
###### - Ecclesiastes 1:5

This article will summarize sections of *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* that were devoted to this type of clock.
It will name each clock, block out the eras of history that it prophesies, point out where in those books it was developed, and (for a few) 
point to an extended treatment in a separate article on this website.

## Creation Clock

  - Bible book: Genesis 1
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Solomon’s Clocks: Ecclesiastes 1
  - Time span: 4020 BC–2280 AD (or later)
  - Intervals: 7
  - Period: 1000 years

**Notable facts:**

Matches the seven days of creation to important events in the seven millennia of history.
This assumes that history will last no more than seven thousand years before the final judgment and the
establishment of the new heavens and new earth. This clock is similar to the ancient expectation of many theologians which is 
called [Millennial Day Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennial_Day_Theory). Many Christians combine the idea of the 
millennial reign of Christ with the idea of a thousand year sabbath during the seventh millennium. 
My formulation of eschatology, **Fractal Historicism**, does not. The two events are distinct.
The millennial kingdom of CHrist has already come and gone, having lasted from 380 to 1380 AD in the form of Christian Rome and its extension
through the Byzantine Empire. If the Creation was on or near 4020 BC, then we are already in the early years of the
seventh millennium, yet Christ has not returned. My expectation is that the eternal sabbath will begin during this millennium,
but not immediately. It could start at any time but the present world order may linger for two or three centuries more.

Day 1 of creation (4020-3020 BC) was when God created light and separated the light from the darkness
by alternating day and night. This matches the division of people into two groups, the righteous descendants of Seth
and the corrupt descendants of Cain.

Day 2 of creation (3020-2020 BC) is the only one God did not call good. This
millennium had Noah's flood and the Tower of Babel, the worst calamities in history (so far).

Day 3 of creation (2020-1020 BC) is when God created the dry ground and plants and trees which grow from seeds. 
The ground is the Law of Moses and the seed is the beginning of the writing of God's Word.

Day 4 of creation (1020-20 BC), when God created the sun, moon & stars,
ends within a few years of the birth of the Sun of Righteousness and Morning Star, Jesus.
This millennium was when most of the prophets lived. Prophecy is about revealing God's future plans, interpreting
history and marking out time, just like the heavenly bodies. Solomon lived at the very beginning of this millennium.
His writings provide the temporal framework for understanding the rest of the prophets.

Day 5 of creation (20 BC-980 AD), when the birds were created, corresponds to the Holy Spirit, given at Pentecost, beginning the 5th millennium.
The sea creatures were also created. Leviathan, the great sea serpent is first given expression in the form of the Roman Empire.

Day 6 of creation (980-1980 AD) saw the creation of the beasts and man. The sixth millennium spans the period during which mankind's knowledge grew fastest.

Day 7 of creation (1980 AD-?) will usher in the sabbath rest, when Christ returns.

## Temple Dedication Clocks

  - Bible book: 1 Kings 8:62–63
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter(s): Psalm 119: The Shepherd’s Clock
  - Timespan: 4020 BC–39 AD, 960 BC–1680 AD
  - Intervals: 22
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

When Solomon dedicated the temple, the quantity of
animals sacrificed used the numbers twenty-two (22) and
one hundred twenty (120). If you start the clock at the
creation and allow Adam and Methuselah their longer
generations, the 22nd generation ends in 39 AD, shortly
after Christ sacrificed his life for our sins on the cross.
Combined with the Psalm 119 clock which defines the
birth of Christ before 19 AD, you can derive a range for
the crucifixion of 19–39 AD!

If you instead start the clock from the temple dedication
in 960 BC, the 22nd generation ends in 1680 AD. This
final generation was the beginning of the Scientific
Revolution and the age of Reason. Solomon, the wisest
non-divine man in history, pointed to the era where
humanity’s earthly wisdom would explode.

## Solomon’s Celestial Clock

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapters: 
    - Solomon’s Celestial Clock,
    - Solomon’s End Times
    - Solomon’s Sundial
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 120 years (per “time”)

**Notable facts:**

This is the most fundamental prophetic clock in the Bible.
It is the scaffolding that allows the others to be fit into a coherent and consistent framework.
That makes it the mainspring of God's prophetic clocks.

By assigning a single word to each generation, Solomon revealed the principal spiritual forces at work from the
dedication of the temple in 960 BC until the day the Lord ushers in eternal peace. His choice of words? Impeccable.
Here are the key events that occurred in half the twenty-eight times:

  - *A time to die*: Northern kingdom of Israel carried into captivity by Assyria.
  - *A time to plant*: Prosperous times for Judah under King Hezekiah.
  - *A time to uproot*: The Babylonian Exile of Judah uproots the Jews from their homeland.
  - *A time to kill*: Attempted genocide of all the Jews by Haman in the Book of Esther.
  - *A time to weep*: The Crucifixion of Jesus.
  - *A time to mourn*: Roman persecution of Christians peaks under Diocletian.
  - *A time to dance*: Rome becomes a Christian empire! Edict of Thessalonica issued in 380 AD.
  - *A time to throw away*: Byzantium abandoned to its fate.
  - *A time to tear*: Protestant Reformation & civil war tears the church apart.
  - *A time to mend*: Dawn of Religious freedom and tolerance.
  - *A time to be silent*: Christians listen to God during the Pietism Movement, Methodist Revival & Great Awakening.
  - *A time to speak*: Great age of Christian missions.
  - *A time to love*: Worldwide increase in health & prosperity and Israel reborn.
  - *A time to hate*: Worldwide persecution of Christians and Jews will soon begin.

The power of this clock is that it operates at different scales of time and on different levels of being.
It structures the history of...

  - a single person via the [Growth Pattern](./growth-pattern.md).
  - ancient Israel and the church as a unity via this clock
  - the secular world from the Creation until the end (via another clock)
  - modern Israel (via a clock in "Appendix C: A Time for Israel" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*)

It structures the levels of...

  - existence in the material world that Solomon calls life "under the sun"
  - existence in the spiritual world, as explained by Jesus in Matthew the Apostle Paul in his first seven letters

As illustrations of the spiritual dimension of Solomon's times:

  - A time to be born is being "born again"
  - A time to die is dying to self and gaining a new identity in Christ, as in Romans 6 and Galatians 2
  - A time to plant is being baptized into the fellowship of the church
  - A time to uproot is severing some ties with non-believers following salvation

With Solomon's times woven into so much of the material and spiritual order of the world, this means that
prophecy is also deeply personal. Neglecting its study is unwise.

You can find more information about this clock in the article [Twice a Thousand Years](./twice-a-thousand-years.html).

You can find more information about the spiritual analogs of the twenty-eight times in [The Righteous Fall Seven Times](./the-righteous-fall-seven-times.html) and [The Apostle Paul's Discipleship Program](./pauls-discipleship-program.md).

## Solomon’s Son-dial

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes 1–10
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapters:
    - Solomons Sundial,
    - The Time of Her Confinement,
    - Rightly Dividing the Words
  - Timespan: 960 BC–2280 AD (and beyond)
  - Intervals: 28 (divided by the phrase “under the sun”)
  - Period: 120 years

**Notable facts:**

Almost a decade ago, I turned my attention to Ecclesiastes. I wrote a program that tallied how often each word and short phrase
was used. The obvious result was that "under the sun" was Solomon's catch phrase. My clumsy research concluded that 
the structure and interpretation of Ecclesiastes was tied up in two things:

 - The poem of the twenty-eight times
 - The phrase "under the sun", which also appears twenty-eight times

It seemed sensible to ask, "Is the list of times a table of contents into the book?" I tried to map those words to
the content of the rest of the book and failed. Also, the phrase "under the sun" is distributed haphazardly.
It appears in one verse twice and in some chapters not at all, including the books two concluding chapters.
I soon abandoned my effort and would not return to Ecclesiastes until 2020. The sad thing is that I was right. 
I had correctly identified the two features of the book whose relationship you must understand in order to solve the riddles of its meaning.
I just didn't know what to do with them.

The twenty-eight times are not a table of contents into Ecclesiastes. They are a table of contents into a human life.
Ecclesiastes is a treatise on the stages of a human life, but some of the "times" are not addressed there.
They are however, addressed in Psalms, Proverbs, Matthew and the other [Seven Pillars of Wisdom](./seven-pillars-of-wisdom.html).

As for the placement of the instances of "under the sun", that was subtle. They are the tick marks on a prophetic sundial. 
Even though they are spaced unevenly, they do divide the book into twenty-eight pieces and each piece does correspond to
one of the twenty-eight times, in sequence. Then the verses between the tick marks contains prophesies that point to events
in the matching era of history. That is why Ecclesiastes is so hard to understand! It is a rundown of all history from 
the dedication of the temple until Christ returns. By combining the time phrase and the words in the bracketed passage
you can understand part of God's plan for history and how it is all developed from an analogy to the life of a single person.

Here are where the "under the sun" references are found in Ecclesiastes and which time goes with each:

  - 1:3 Born
  - 1:9 Die
  - 1:14 Plant
  - 2:11 Uproot
  - 2:17 Kill
  - 2:18 Heal
  - 2:19 Tear down
  - 2:20 Build
  - 2:22 Weep
  - 3:16 Laugh
  - 4:1 Mourn
  - 4:3 Dance
  - 4:7 Scatter stones
  - 4:15 Gather stones
  - 5:13 Embrace
  - 5:18 Refrain
  - 6:1 Search
  - 6:12 Give up
  - 8:9 Keep
  - 8:15 Throw away
  - 8:17 Tear
  - 9:3 Mend
  - 9:6 Be Silent
  - 9:9 Speak, Love
  - 9:11 Hate
  - 9:13 War
  - 10:5 Peace

The subtlest riddle in the Bible is hidden in “a thousand years twice over” in Ecclesiastes 6:6, whose answer gives us 120 years
as the length of one of Solomon’s “times”. The solving of that riddle is the subject of [Twice a Thousand Years](./twice-a-thousand-years.html).

A few interesting prophecies that fall out of the book are: 

 1. On the “sun-dial”, the poem of the twenty-eight times occurs during “a time to weep” – when Jesus died for our sins, marking
that the most important of times.
 2. Verse 9:9 says “meaningless” and “under the sun” twice and has the book’s only positive use of “love”. It falls on “a time to speak” and “a time to love”, season of God’s greatest outpouring of mercy upon the world and the greatest era of overseas Christian missions.

In the chapter "Solomon's Sundial", the placement of the "under the sun" usages was also used as a scaffold to study the distribution of other common phrases throughout the book. One example should suffice. It is the word "wind" which is often used to indicate futility as in "chasing after the wind".

### Wind

Wind can mean “spirit”. The King James uses “vexation of spirit” in place of “chasing after the wind”.
The impossibilities of catching the wind, containing it, or
stopping its repetitive cycles are all conveyed by
Ecclesiastes. The endless cycle is introduced in 1:6 with 
*“The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.”* 
Then the futility of chasing it is found all over. Since we can’t take anything
with us when we die, 5:6 says we “toil for the wind”. In 8:8
we are reminded that we can’t hold onto our spirit and so
overcome death by the words “no one has power over the
wind to contain it...” The final mentions describe the
mysteriousness of the wind:

#### “Whoever watches the **wind** will not plant;
##### whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
#### As you do not know the path of the **wind**,
##### or how the body is formed in a mother’s womb,
#### so you cannot understand the work of God,
##### the Maker of all things."
###### - Ecclesiastes 11:4-5, NIV

It is no mystery which verses speak of the wind:

**1:6,14,17; 2:11,17,26; 4:4,6,16; 5:16; 6:9; 8:8; 11:4-5**

If the phrase occurs in a verse that falls between a pair of
“under the sun” verses, we will assume the “wind” phrase
is relevant to both corresponding “times”. If the phrase is
in the same verse as “under the sun”, we only match it with
one time.

For example, 1:6 includes “wind” and falls between 1:3
(born) and 1:9 (die), so it will be assigned both *born* and *die*.

On the other hand, 1:14 has both “under the sun” and
“chasing after the wind”, so it is only assigned the time
“plant”.

If you continue this for all fourteen “wind” verses, you
will collectively match seventeen of the times. You can
rationalize good reasons for each match, such as terrible
defeats or the destruction of the temple, but the clearest,
simplest story that they tell may only be inferred by looking
at the times that were NOT matched. Those unmatched
times are the the sundial’s shadow. They are clumped into
three groups of adjacent times:

  - Heal, Tear down, Build
  - Mourn
  - Throw away, Tear, Mend, Be silent, Speak, Love, Hate, War

What distinguishes these three periods of history from
the rest? Satan. The three times in the first group span the
silent years between the two testaments, when there were
no prophets to add to the Word of God, the darkest time for
Israel. That means the Spirit (the wind) was not at work
sending authoritative messages to Israel to add to the Bible.
The second group has one time, the time of the worst of
the Roman persecutions, under Diocletian. This is what
Revelation has to say about that time:

#### I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! 
#### I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews 
#### and are not, but are a synagogue of **Satan**. 
#### Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. 
#### I tell you, the **devil** will put some of you in prison 
#### to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. 
#### Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will 
#### give you life as your victor’s crown.
###### - Revelation 2:9-10, NIV

After that, there is a long stretch where wind appears
repeatedly. The millennium from “a time to dance” through
“a time to keep” constitutes the thousand years that Satan
was bound, between the Edict of Thessalonica and the
commencement of the long period of Ottoman sieges
against Constantinople, leading to its fall. The Spirit blew
freely during those years and experienced limited Satanic
opposition while the church grew.

After Satan was unbound, chaos ensued. Byzantium fell.
The Reformation split the church and led to centuries of
religious wars. More recently, the devil has deceived the
nations; apostasy has spread, as formerly Christian nations
abandon the faith. From “a time to throw away” to “a time
to hate” (in our near future), the wind is absent again. That
will end when history reaches “a time of war”. Christ will
return in the middle or end of that time, and the Holy Spirit
will complete his mission as well, as is revealed in
Revelation:

#### Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, 
#### standing at the center of the throne, encircled by 
#### the four living creatures and the elders. 
#### The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the
#### **seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth**.
###### - Revelation 5:6, NIV

Lest there be confusion, the Holy Spirit has never nor
will ever be entirely absent from this world. What the
preceding shows is that the balance of influence between
the Holy Spirit and Satan’s evil spirits has shifted over time,
first one way then the other. As the final two occurrences of
“wind” attest, we “do not know the path of the wind”.

## Lamps of the Ten Virgins

  - Bible book: Matthew 25
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: The Time of Her Confinement
  - Timespan: 1–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 10
  - Period: 240 years (per lamp)

**Notable facts:**

In this parable from Matthew 25, ten virgins are to wait for the Bridegroom to arrive for the wedding.
When he arrives, they are to meet him with lamps lit, attend to his needs
and make the final preparations for the wedding. However, the Bridegroom is long in coming.
The five foolish virgins did not plan for this and had run out of oil for their lamps.
While they are at the market buying more oil, the Bridegroom arrives and the wedding starts.
When they return, they are barred from entering the wedding and lose their right to participate
in the festivities.

When interpreted as a celestial clock, this parable assumes the clock began with Solomon but that
we can skip over the first eight times, which is four seasons. That is because Jesus ascended to heaven
(hence is the Bridegroom who went away until it was time for the wedding) during the ninth time,
a time to weep. From "a time to weep" to "a time for peace" is twenty times or equivalently ten seasons.

With that understood, each virgin with a lamp stands for one of Solomon’s “seasons”, which is
made up of two 120-year “times”. During five of those ten seasons, women of the church were prepared, 
including the current season. One ill-prepared season remains. All told, the women of the church
were prepared during these seasons:

  - Season 5: a time to weep and a time to laugh (1-240 AD)
  - Season 6: a time to mourn and a time to dance (240-480 AD)
  - Season 11: a time to tear and a time to mend (1440-1680 AD)
  - Season 12: a time to be silent and a time to speak (1680-1920 AD)
  - Season 13: a time to love and a time to hate (1920-2160 AD)

In the beginning of the church, women were the first to see the risen Christ, participated actively 
in running churches in their homes and assisting in missionary efforts.
During the years when the women of the church were not prepared, whose fault was that?
Women were progressively excluded from positions in the church from 360-480 AD.
Then on the other side, the Protestant Reformation promoted the priesthood of all believers.
Protestant schools taught women to read and they slowly began to progress towards equality.

Why should we conclude that this parable is about whether the church respects and trains up
women for service? The parable has many layers of meaning. On the surface, a wise or foolish virgin is
an individual Christian, male or female, who has taken initiative to prepare for the return of Christ
through learning the doctrines of the faith and obeying them conscientiously through acts of service.
On a higher level, it is whole churches, since Revelation tells us that lamp stands stand for churches. 
On the highest level, it is whole eras of the church age, when the church as a whole was either prepared
or not. The identification of the preparedness or unpreparedness of women is offered as a synedoche, a single, identifiable
sign and symptom of the church's condition that stands for the whole of its problems.

The parable does not tell us which church ages were prepared or not. For that we must add in information from:

  - Church history
  - Other prophecies, like the letters to the Seven Churches in Revelation

The chapter "Seven Churches for Seven Eras" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* matches the seven named churches
to seven eras of history, using evidence from scripture, church history and archaeology. The assigned dates for the
early church ages are similar to those proposed by scholars at the time of the Reformation, while
those for the later ages are based on my own research.

The churches that Jesus mostly praised can be identified with the prepared virgins. The churches that Jesus had the harshest criticism 
for can be identified with the foolish virgins. Those seven eras are not uniform in length, but by placing them 
alongside the ten seasons of this parable, you will find that the praised church eras constitute half of church history.

In the following chart, two thirds of the way down the image are two rows labeled "Ten Virgins" and "Letters to the Seven Churches".
The blocks labeled "YES" are the eras when the church was prepared. These are those prepared church ages:

  - Ephesus (33-100 AD)
  - Smyrna (100-313 AD)
  - Pergamum (313-550 AD) Only the first third or so of this era was prepared. As the era progressed, the acceptable roles of women were progressively diminished by popes and councils.
  - Philadelphia (1453-1990 AD)
  - Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The church will be prepared during the first half of this, our current era, but steadily lose ground.

The unprepared church eras were:

  - Pergamum (313-550 AD) The second two-thirds of the era.
  - Thyatira (550-964 AD) The whole era.
  - Sardis (964-1453 AD) The whole era.
  - Laodicea (1990 AD-?) The second half of the era.

</a>

A time of darkness will one day come when no one can work. The time of war will 
test us all. Will women be prepared for this? Will men?

## Grand Father Clock

  - Bible book: Ecclesiastes
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: [A Grand Father Clock & a Silver Cord](./grandfather-clock.html)
  - Timespan: 4020 BC–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 42 (plus a short one)
  - Period: 175 years (for 28 eras), 100 years (for 14 eras)

**Notable facts:**

One reason why scholars are stumped by Ecclesiastes is that it has multiple prophetic 
sequences overlaying one another. The same passage may have some verses that are prophecies for one clock
while having other verses that are part of a second. Ecclesiastes has at least four:

  1. The poem of Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 describes a clock from the temple dedication to Christ's return.
  2. The major portion of the book describes a clock from the temple dedication to Christ's return, divided into eras by the phrase "under the sun".
  3. The whole book describes a clock from the Creation to Christ's return, divided into eras first by the phrase "under the sun", then by other textual clues.
  4. The major portion of the book describes a clock from the Holocaust to Christ's return, divided into eras by the phrase "under the sun".

The first two listed above go hand in hand. They describe the growth of ancient Israel and a remnant's transformation into the church as
a unit from birth to full maturity. When Christ returns, the church will be spiritually vital. The bride will be ready and in her prime.

The third clock listed above describes the growth of human civilization from birth to maturity to decline to death. It covers the whole
life arc of Ecclesiastes, not omitting the days of darkness and decline. It does not have a happy ending like the other three.

The fourth clock governs the history of modern Israel.

This section is about the third clock above, for all humanity. It follows the rise and fall of human civilization
through three phases:

  - years of growth (28 times of 175 years each) from 4020 BC-880 AD
  - productive years (12 times of 100 years each) from 880-2080 AD
  - years of decline (2 times) from 2080-2280 AD or beyond

It identifies the centuries in which:

  - Satan would be unbound (1380–1480 AD)
  - New printing technology would let “fools multiply words”
  - Kingdoms would have kings to rule as fools (1580–1680 AD), during the General Crisis
  - Or rule as wise (1680–1780 AD), during the Enlightenment
  - Or do away with kings altogether (1780–1880 AD), as democracy and revolution spread
  - To be followed by Feasting (1880–1980 AD), as health, long life and prosperity spread worldwide

Let's zoom in on one verse to get the flavor. Ecclesiastes 10 is an extended metaphor for building a house.
Is that not a fitting analogy for building a civilization? Setting aside for now how the calculation was made,
the first half of verse 9 may be associated with the era 1180-1280 AD.

#### Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them... 
###### - Ecclesiastes 10:9a

A modern work site sees an endless stream of trucks dropping off supplies. The masonry work may require
marble, granite, brick, natural stone or cinder blocks. This verse, about quarrying stone, 
is the most on-the-nose verse in the chapter. The late twelfth and thirteenth centuries were the peak of the age of church building. Many of the great cathedrals were constructed during this century. It is estimated that during
this phase of the establishment of Christendom, more stone was quarried for churches than was used for all the
pyramids and temples of Ancient Egypt combined. A few decades into the next era, the addition of a new spire
to the Lincoln Cathedral made it the tallest building in the world, a title it held for 237 years.
(Prior to that, the Pyramid of Giza held the title for 3,800 years!)

This clock chronicles the rise and fall of modern Western Civilization. It is sobering to hear about its approaching demise.

**Notable facts:**

The Seven Historical Psalms have long been regarded as a unit. 
They look backward on Israel's history and most have references to the plagues on Egypt,
parting of the Red Sea and initial conquest of the land.
Each of the Psalms has ties to one of the seven phases of the [Harvest Pattern](./harvest-pattern.html),
so that pattern organizes and sequences them into a larger pattern.
The retrospective focus hides the prophetic intent. The true goal of these psalms is to look forward
to what God will do next. How do we know this? The psalmist tells us!

#### Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
##### incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
#### I will open my mouth in a **parable**;
##### I will utter **dark sayings** from of old,
#### things that we have heard and known,
##### that our fathers have told us.
###### - Psalm 78:1-3

In place of "dark sayings" some translations use "riddles", "puzzling problems" or "mysteries".
It is our privilege to probe those mysteries and perhaps solve them. 

Each of these seven psalms has its own prophetic clock. Some selections:

**Psalm 105** picks just seven of the ten plagues against Egypt and reorders them to each match a different millennium.

  - The fifth plague of hail destroys fig tree and vine, but not olive tree, signifying that Israel would lose their political power (the fig tree) and receive no more prophets (the vine), but their religion (the olive tree) would continue. The time would be the fifth millennium, which began with the birth of Christ and the total loss of sovereignty to Rome and later the Islamic empires and Crusaders.
  - The sixth plague, of locusts, matches the sixth millennium’s fit of European colonial expansion. This is not the only Bible prophecy that likens those colonial empires to locusts. See [153 and the Fifth Trumpet](./153-and-the-fifth-trumpet.html) for an interpretation of the blowing of the Fifth Trumpet in Revelation.

**Psalm 106** also offers a millennial clock.

 - For the fifth millennium, it predicts the people would “not believe his promise” (106:24), i.e. reject the messiah, and be exiled a second time, when God “scatter\[s\] them throughout the lands.” (106:24-27)
 - For the sixth millennium, this psalm predicts the AIDS epidemic.

**Psalm 107** parallels the 28 times of Ecclesiastes 3 in structure as well as mirroring the 
sevenfold harvest pattern. It covers the period 33–2280 AD and allocates 321 years for
each four “times”. For example, Psalm 107:10-16, which corresponds to
weeping, laughing, mourning and dancing, describes the Dark Ages, using the word darkness four times.
Then Psalm 107:23-32, corresponding to the times to search, to
give up, to keep, and throw away, describes a sea voyage. This
matches the era of sea exploration, when the church reached
the Americas.

The most amazing prophecy is one that correctly identifies the
order in which the Jewish people would return to Israel from
exile, in Psalm 107:1-3. The sequence was from the hand of the
foe (Hitler’s Germany), from the east (Iran, Iraq, etc.), from the
west (Egypt, North Africa), from the north (Iron Curtain
countries including Russia), and from the south (the rest of the
world). This prophecy also correctly identifies the direction of
expansion in the five major periods of Christian expansion.

For a detailed analysis of Psalm 107, see the article [Psalm 107: Where is the Love?](./psalm-107.html).

**Psalm 136** has 26 of Solomon’s 28 times, with the two
remaining times being found in the two Biblical events at which
this psalm was recited: the temple dedication and before a
battle when King Jehoshaphat faced an overwhelming force.
This psalm prophecies dozens of events, including the coming
of Christ (“the sun to govern the day”), the Byzantine Empire’s
successful raid of Damietta, Egypt in 853 AD, the flight to the
Americas of the pilgrims, the abolition of slavery, and the
defeat of Hitler.

**Why would God put so many prophesies in the Psalms?**

Twenty-five years ago, I didn't even like poetry. When I came across it in the Bible, I endured it.
It struck me as emotional and imprecise - I am an engineer. The narratives told stories rich in detail, 
the sequencing of events and logical forms that I could sink my intellectual teeth into. 
Paul's letters, though poetic in expression, communicated intricate philosophical ideas and doctrines.

It was not until I began writing my novels that I got hooked. I blame God. I decided that
my hero's wife was a literature professor. While he was in a coma, I had her read poetry to him at his bedside
in the hospital. What kind of poems does a lit teacher like? To write her character convincingly,
I forced myself to read lots of poems as part of my research. I didn't know it at the time, but writing 
that novel was my education in how to read and enjoy poetry. It would be essential years later when I 
faced Job and later the Psalms. You cannot understand what you do not love.

Discovering the prophetic content of the Psalms required years of study.
The book is so large and complex that a single assault on this fortress of knowledge
can never breach its walls. My first success was with [Psalm 119](./psalm-119.html). These seven Psalms came next.
Then in short order, Psalms 102 and the seven Thunder Psalms. After that, other structures, like
the first twenty-eight psalms matching the twenty-eight times of Solomon followed,
plus the notable pairing of Psalms 111 and 112. Bringing up the rear was my discovery of the riches hidden 
in Psalm 19, said by C. S. Lewis to be the greatest in the psalter and among the greatest poems ever written.
I am convinced that I have still only scratched the surface.

This brings us to the question. Why the Psalms? Why put so many prophecies there? Poems in antiquity
had regular and intricate structures. Some of their forms have only been rediscovered in the last century or so.
This regularity with subtlety is ready-made as a matrix upon which to stamp and conceal mysteries.
The subjective emotions and colorful imagery can easily encode truths. If you add enough layers to the text,
readers will likely give up after piercing a few but before they reach the bottom.

Given that my engineering mind recoiled for so long from undertaking a careful study of the Bible's poetry,
I think God did it to thumb his nose at the world's intellectuals. I am glad I finally relented and
discovered in God's poetry the truths that my heart longed to find.

## Matthew’s Monthly Planner

  - Bible book: Matthew
  - Defined in: *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*
  - Chapter: One Greater than Solomon
  - Timespan: 33–2280 AD
  - Intervals: 28
  - Period: 321 years per four times

**Notable facts:**

This clock shows that every chapter of Matthew corresponds to
one of Solomon’s twenty-eight times, making Jesus the new Solomon.
Here are some highlights:

Here are brief comments summarizing the findings from the chapter.
I was able to find for every chapter of Matthew some content that matches the corresponding time from Solomon's poem.
I was not able to find prophecies for every chapter. However, every time I look at Matthew, I find more. 
Just today (June 22, 2024) I found three more, so have included them, even though 
they were not in the book as published.

    Verse 3:6 says, <em>"Confessing their sins, they were baptized by [John] in the Jordan River."</em> <br/>

    This chapter recounts the Baptism of Jesus (3:13-17). John the Baptist challenges
    the leaders to produce the fruit of repentance (3:7-10).
    Then we see Jesus as a contrast. Compare to this Psalm,
    which describes Jesus planted by the water, producing good fruit: 
    <br/>
    <em> That person is like a tree <br/>
    planted by streams of water, <br/>
    which yields its fruit in season <br/>
    and whose leaf does not wither— <br/>
    whatever they do prospers. (Psalm 1:3) </em>
    <br/>

    During the reign of Emperor Gallienus (253-268) and for a few decades afterward, 
    the “Little Peace of the Church” gave the church a reprieve. It put down roots and grew rapidly 
    because it had been well-planted and watered.

    Rome in this era tried to uproot Christianity with its
    final persecution, but it was Rome’s pagan culture that
    was uprooted following Constantine’s conversion. This
    first great testing of the church was over: <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. (4:11)</em> <br/>

    This anticipates the binding of Satan, which would begin twenty-six years later

    <br/>
    <em>Blessed are the meek, <br/>

    Matthew tells of the feeding of the five thousand, which matches the Medieval Warm Period when a revolution in agriculture in the 11th and 12th centuries enabled people to "gather" a bountiful harvest.

    Jesus says we may need to "give up" an eye or cut off a foot if it causes us to sin. During this time, God gave up on Byzantium. By telling his disciples to forgive their brother seventy times seven times, he decreed the number of years an offense by the Orthodox Church would be tolerated until they were overthrown. The offense (related to rejecting the Filioque clause in the creed) occurred in 867 AD, deepened for a few decades, and Constantinople refused to back down for the next 490 years, resulting in Satan being unbound in 1380 AD to wage war against them.

    Jesus silences his critics, saying, “They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them”. In this era abolitionists began to lift that load off of people’s shoulders. <br/>

    Jerusalem of the 19th century was desolate. The population was less than 40,000, with perhaps 13,000 of them Jewish. By Ottoman law, the name of a Jew could not appear on a property deed.
    This changed with the Land Emancipation Act of 1876, near the end of this era. Finally Jews could own property,
    so they began to return from exile.
