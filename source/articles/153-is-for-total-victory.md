title: 153 is for Total Victory
quote: So Simon Peter ... hauled the net ashore, <br/> full of large fish, 153 of them. <br/> And although there were so many, <br/>the net was not torn. - John 21:11

This number is different from the others.
All other numbers in this section of the website were described in the chapter "To Number Our Days" in *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew*.
This number was instead explored in *Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace* in the chapter "Answering Habakkuk". That chapter ran for over fifty pages!
This article will only scratch the surface.

For almost two thousand years, Christians have proposed meanings for the one hundred fifty-three (153) fish caught by the disciples.
It was not just a miracle, it was a miracle with a number attached! That has fueled rampant speculation.
