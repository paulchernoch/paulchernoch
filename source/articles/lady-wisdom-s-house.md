## When is a House not a House?

I learned a riddle as a child.

#### Q: When is a door not a door?
#### A: When it is ajar.

So when is a house not a house? When it is a metaphor. The Bible uses the image of a house in many of its teachings. Since one particular edifice, Lady Wisdom's House, is the subject of this entire website, it is incumbent upon me to prove that understanding and applying the meaning behind the metaphor is important to every Christian. Not every reference to a house in the Bible is captured by this metaphor, so let's begin by selecting some that are. 

First, what are some common meanings that people in the Bible attribute to the idea of a house? 

  - **To kings**, building a house means establishing a long-lasting dynasty that can govern wisely and protect the people of the nation from invaders.
  - **To priests**, building a house means constructing a temple acceptable to God so that God might dwell among His people and show His favor to them.
  - **To families**, building a house means security and stability, a posterity to be built upon to benefit generations to come.
  - **To individuals**, building a house means both the construction of a literal house and the forming of strong, godly character.
  - **To the church of Christ**, building a house means training in righteousness and evangelism, the growing and maturing of the body of Christ.

And what does building a house mean to the philosopher? It means a collection of principles and a body of knowledge that fits together into a harmonious whole.

Conversely, the destruction of a house is the loss of all those things.

Now importance can be measured in several ways. Here are four:

  - A truth may be important in its depth, touching on matters of salvation or the nature of God. 
  - A truth may be important in its scope, binding together seemingly disparate ideas.
  - A truth may be important in its timing, being restricted to one era or applicable across all generations.
  - A truth may be important in its capacity to reveal new truth, being a clue that leads the scholar onward to new insights.

The Bible's teaching about Lady Wisdom's House is important for all those reasons: it is deep, wide, eternal and revelatory.

When I ponder the relative importance of Bible teachings, it is good to start with Jesus. If Jesus said something is important, it is important. 
The Sermon on the Mount is considered one of Jesus' core teachings, including the Beatitudes and the Golden Rule. Here is how that speech ends:

#### “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them 
#### will be like **a wise man who built his house on the rock**. 
#### And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew 
#### and beat on that house, but it did not fall, 
#### because it had been founded on the rock. 
#### And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them 
#### will be like **a foolish man who built his house on the sand**. 
#### And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew 
#### and beat against that house, and it fell, 
#### and great was the fall of it.”
#### - Matthew 7:24-27

Straightaway, Jesus likens obeying his teachings to building a house on the rock. His words are the foundation of a secure life.
The impression that these verses left me with during my early years as a Christian was that this figure of speech was a helpful simile
used by Jesus so that I could understand better. I sold him short. The analogy does more than communicate, it connects. 
As a kid, I assembled paper models that had labeled tabs that had to be inserted into matching slots. Jesus and the other prophets often 
used phrases that connect the parts together into a larger idea. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

Here are a few examples of where what seems to be a clever turn of phrase is really a clue to something deeper.

**The Seven Spirits of God**. Revelation uses this phrase a few times. If there are seven spirits, what are they? Are they different?
Some scholars, looking for a list of spirits numbering seven, matched this to Isaiah 11:2. I agree. Knowing there is a special collection
of spirits called "The Seven Spirits of God" challenged people to look and eventually find the definition. How does knowing this help?
It says in Revelation that God sent those spirits out into the whole earth. Did he send them out all at once or one at a time?
Did this sending occur once or multiple times? Were the spirits sent in a particular order? Does this tell us something about how God operates?
I tackled all these questions and more in *Peace* and found answers. God has sent them out multiple times, in the order listed in Isaiah.
Each has a different purpose and produces a different effect on the history of the church or the world. 
Seeing this pattern enables us to understand more about the structure of God's plan for the salvation of the world.
The chapter "Swords, Seals & Surviving to Saturday" shows how each spirit is associated with one time that the Lord has drawn his sword in 
a spectacular way, connecting the spirits to God's judgment. This is in keeping with the phrase "the sword of the spirit" from Ephesians 6:17. 
Each spirit also matches a different phase of spiritual growth, as shown in "Appendix H: Clues to the Seven Pillars". 
And a different spirit was sent to each of the seven churches that received a letter from Jesus in Revelation.

**The Voices of the Seven Thunders**. Revelation 10 has a marvelous riddle. The voices of the seven thunders speak, then John is ordered
not to write down what they said. This has to be one of the most baffling passages in the Bible! If we cannot know what they said, what is the 
purpose of including this chapter in the Bible at all? This is a case of what security engineers call information leakage. 

One famous example of information leakage is called the [German Tank Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem). 
During World War II, the Allies tried to estimate tank production using aerial surveillance and other techniques. 
They also captured two tanks in battle. It turns out that the Germans printed serial numbers on many parts,
like the wheels and gears. The serial numbers started at one and increased in an unbroken sequence. 
By applying statistical models to the part numbers on just those two tanks, they estimated that 270 tanks of that type had been produced prior 
to a certain battle. After the war, the British got the actual production figures: 274 tanks. The statistical methods were far more accurate than the
other forms of intelligence that projected far fewer tanks. 

How does this apply to the Bible? Revelation 10 tells us that the voices of the seven thunders exist. 
This tells us that they are a meaningful category. Knowing this, we can look for them elsewhere. 
I found them. We cannot know what the seven thunders told John, but we can know what they said elsewhere in the Bible.
They previously spoke in Exodus, Job, Psalms and elsewhere in Revelation. Common phrasing and themes tie all these passages together,
as explored in the chapter "Aftertaste: Donner & Blitzen" in *Peace*.

**The Seven Pillars of Wisdom**. Many people have tried to identify the seven pillars of wisdom named by Solomon in Proverbs 9:1. 
By placing such riddles in the Bible, God challenges people to read Scripture more closely that they may find answers and be blessed by them.
Identifying and defending a particular identification of the seven pillars was a major goal of both *Peace, like Solomon Never Knew* and 
*Plague, Precept, Prophet, Peace*. With a solution to that riddle, I proceeded to extend the metaphor that I might discover more of the
architectural elements of Lady Wisdom's house.
