## When is a House not a House?

I learned a riddle as a child.

#### Q: When is a door not a door?
#### A: When it is ajar.

So when is a house not a house? When it is a metaphor. The Bible uses the image of a house in many of its teachings. Since one particular edifice, Lady Wisdom's House, is the subject of this entire website, it is incumbent upon me to prove that understanding and applying the meaning behind the metaphor is important to every Christian. Not every reference to a house in the Bible is captured by this metaphor, so let's begin by selecting some that are. 

First, what are some common meanings that people in the Bible attribute to the idea of a house? 

  - **To kings**, building a house meant establishing a long-lasting dynasty that can govern wisely and protect the people of the nation from invaders.
  - **To priests**, building a house meant constructing a temple acceptable to God so that God might dwell among His people and show His favor to them.
  - **To families**, building a house meant security and stability, a posterity to be built upon to benefit generations to come.
  - **To individuals**, building a house meant both the construction of a literal house and the forming of strong, godly character.
  - **To the Christian church**, building a house meant training in righteousness and evangelism, the growing and maturing of the body of Christ

Conversely, the destruction of a house is the loss of all those things.

When I ponder the relative importance of Bible teachings, it is good to start with Jesus. If Jesus said something is important, it is important.
