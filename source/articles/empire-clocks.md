Empire Clocks follow a series of empires, each of different longevity. They do not usually contain quantitative measures
of how long each empire will last. In Scripture, empires are symbolized in many ways:

  - by name (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Greece, Rome, etc)
  - as beasts (lion, leopard, goat, wolves, eagle, sea serpent, etc)
  - as metals (gold, silver, bronze, iron)
  - by military insignia (eagle, boar, moon, stars, etc)
  - by vegetation (specific tree or flower, like fig tree)

The two most common designations seem to be as beasts or metals. A given symbol usually refers to the same empire
across Bible books, but there are exceptions. The lion and eagle have been the symbols for many empires, so
additional details from the text are needed to make a proper identification. For example, the eagle can mean Rome,
Byzantium or the United States. The lion can mean Egypt (as the lion was a symbol of Pharaoh), Babylon or the British Empire.

The Bible has prophecies about many empires, but not all appear in prophetic clocks.
There seems to be a main sequence of ten empires that appear in many Empire Clocks, stretching
all the way from Babel to Leviathan, the last empire. The defining feature of these main empires
is that most captured Jerusalem (as asserted by Ellis Skolfield). The only exceptions
are Babel, Egypt and Assyria. Babel (possibly the Akkadian Empire) likely held the later location
of Jerusalem in its territory. Egypt may have held the site of Jerusalem from time to time, but
more importantly held the Hebrews as slaves. As for Assyria, it captured and deported Israel, but merely
made Judah a tribute-paying vassal.

Most Empire Clocks include a subset of the empires; only one that I have discovered references all ten.
The illustration at the top of this article shows the first nine, from Babel to Islam. The tenth is Leviathan,
which along with its companion, Behemoth, has not yet arisen.
