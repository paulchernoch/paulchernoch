# Sitemap for the Website.
#   - All articles will be listed in a hierarchy.
#   - Leaves are articles while category nodes are summary pages.
#     Articles do not have a list of parts while summary pages do.
#   - All articles and sections will be stored in the same directory, 
#     so the same article may appear in multiple places in the hierarchy.
#   - The hierarchy is used to generate the table of contents 
#     that appears in the left sidebar.
#
# Each article or category section has these properties (some optional):
#
#   - title:   Title of the article or section.
#   - sub:     Subtitle of the article or section (optional).
#   - named:   The file name (optional). If omitted, use the title to generate it.
#   - brief:   Summary or synopsis of the article or section (optional).
#   - image:   FontAwesome classes that identify the icon to use (if omitted, no icon)
#   - dates:   List of publication dates in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" (with no quotes).
#   - parts:   Lists subsections or articles belonging to the section (optional).
#              If parts is present, it is a section, otherwise an article.
#   - footer:  Page footer text.
#
# While building the site, additional volatile properties will be added to the page record, so do not set these:
#   - link:      The href file reference for the toc hyperlinks pointing to the given file.
#   - open:      True if toc entry should start out in the expanded state, false if collapsed.
#   - created:   First date from dates
#   - updated:   Last date from dates
#   - target:    Path to write html page, derived from config build dir and named or title props.
#   - words:     Text loaded from markdown file and converted to html.
#        
#
# Every article or category will have a corresponding markdown file.
# The article or category section of the page will be assembled
# as follows:
#    
#   1. If "named" is given, it names the markdown file holding the article or section.
#      If not, the title will be converted into a file name 
#      by replacing spaces and punctuation with hyphens.
#      The input markdown file has the ".md" extension.
#      A second file name will be generated with an ".html" extension 
#      to hold the generated html code..
#
#   2. The article title from this yaml file will be used in the table of contents.
#      If the markdown file has its own "title" property, that title will be 
#      enclosed in an h1 tag and inserted before the body of the article.
#      If the markdown file has no "title" property, the title from this 
#      yaml file will be used instead.
#      This allows the TOC to have a short name for the article but the article listing
#      to have a longer title.
#
#   3. If the yaml file has a "sub" property, a subtitle will be added on a separate
#      line after the title in the article. If not but the markdown file has a "sub""
#      property, it will be used as the subtitle. 
#      Subtitles will be styled as h2 elements, but centered.
# 
#   4. The article summary given by the "brief" property will be enclosed in 
#      a synopsis box following the title.
#      This is done by enclosing the text in a div with class="synopsis".
#      If no "brief" is given, no synopsis box will be shown.
#
#   5. The rest of the article listing will be made by converting the markdown file
#      into HTML using the python markdown2 library (https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2). 
#      Poetry lines with different indentation should begin with 
#      four, five or six hashes, which become h4, h5 or h6 elements.
#      Thus the title should not be repeated in the markdown file, 
#      except as an attribute in the attribute block.
#
#   6. If it is a section node in the hierarchy, hyperlinks to all the articles 
#      or subsections in the section will be added at the end of the sectin text.
#
#   7. Every article or subsection will have a link up to the enclosing section, if any.
#
#   8. At the end of the article, the original publication date from "dates" will be noted,
#      and if there are more than one, the most recent date as well will be given as the revision date.
#      Assume that the dates are sorted from oldest to newest.
